__label__politics Washington (CNN) I've written -- a lot -- about how the most enduring legacy of Donald Trump's presidency, whether it lasts four years or eight years, is his unapologetic assault on facts and the idea of truth. We have simply never had a president who says as many things that aren't true as Donald Trump. Or a president who, once it's clear what he's saying isn't accurate, takes such pleasure in repeating falsehoods.

Which brings me to The Washington Post Fact Checker's running count of how many things Trump has said -- since being sworn in on January 20, 2017, that are either misleading or totally untrue. And to these two sentences in particular: "As of day 558, he's made 4,229 Trumpian claims — an increase of 978 in just two months. That's an overall average of nearly 7.6 claims a day."

The President of the United States is saying more than seven things that aren't true a day. SEVEN.

averaging -- 16 falsehoods a day. (As a thought experiment, try to lie -- or misrepresent -- 16 times tomorrow. I bet you can't.) And, what's more, his tendency toward untruth is actually picking up steam. As WaPo's Glenn Kessler Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly note, Trump was averaging less than five false or misleading claims in his first 100 days. (Only five!) But, between June and July Trump is averaging ---- 16 falsehoods a day. (As a thought experiment, try to lie -- or misrepresent -- 16 times tomorrow. I bet you can't.)

It's not just the raw numbers either. Trump has ramped up his disdain and dismissiveness of all forms of communication that don't originate with him. "Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening," Trump said earlier this month. "Just stick with us, don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news." On Tuesday, at a campaign rally in Tampa, Florida, Trump said: "You know, polls are fake, just like everything else."

__label__politics (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has referred a collection of cases to New York federal prosecutors concerning whether several high-profile American lobbyists and operatives failed to register their work as foreign agents, according to people familiar with the matter.

The transfer of the inquiries marks an escalation of Mueller's referrals to the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in the period since he turned over a case involving President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen.

Since the spring, Mueller has referred matters to SDNY involving longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta and his work for his former firm, the Podesta Group, and former Minnesota Republican Rep. Vin Weber and his work for Mercury Public Affairs, the sources said.

One source said that former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, a former partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, is also part of the inquiry.

None of the entities involved have been charged with wrongdoing, and there is no indication the SDNY inquiry will result in criminal charges.

It's not clear whether they are considered one case or separate matters, these people said, though all involve inquiries into whether the men improperly performed work on behalf of groups associated with Ukraine without registering with the Justice Department as foreign agents.

Federal law requires that an entity representing a foreign political party or government file public reports detailing the relationship.

At least one of the matters, involving Podesta, was referred to SDNY by Mueller's team shortly before the FBI executed searches of Cohen's home, office and hotel room in early April, according to the sources, though there is no sign that the timing was related to the Cohen investigation. It couldn't be determined if the other matters were referred at the same time.

It's also not clear exactly why Mueller referred the matters to federal prosecutors in New York. Both Mercury and Skadden have offices in Manhattan, though Weber and Craig are based in Washington, DC, and performed the work in question while based in offices there. Podesta and his former firm are also based in Washington. SDNY, however, could claim jurisdiction for reasons such as the location of banking transactions associated with the activity under examination.

Mueller has come under scrutiny from Trump and others for what they perceive as the special counsel's examination of matters beyond the scope of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election cycle, and Mueller's referral of cases that aren't closely linked to that central matter could be a way of insulating the special counsel probe from such backlash, people familiar with the situation said.

A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the US attorney's office declined to comment.

A representative for Podesta and the Podesta Group declined to comment.

An attorney for Weber, who led Mercury's Ukraine-linked lobbying work, declined to comment.

"We welcome any inquiry, as we always have, since we acted appropriately at every step of the process, including hiring the best lawyer in Washington we could and following his advice," said Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury.

Craig declined to comment. Skadden declined to comment.

Mueller had been scrutinizing all three firms as part of his inquiry into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, who were both charged by the special counsel's office with failing to file as foreign agents relating to a decade of work they did for the Party of Regions, a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.

Manafort, who pleaded not guilty and faces trial on the matter in September, and Gates, who pleaded guilty, paid the Mercury and Podesta firms through a nonprofit, European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, for work that was subsequently revealed to have been done on behalf of Ukraine's government, according to court filings.

Mueller had been examining whether Mercury and the Podesta Group properly identified to federal authorities their foreign advocacy for the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, CNN previously reported. The ECFMU is a Brussels-based nonprofit group that federal prosecutors have called a mouthpiece for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians.

The Podesta Group has said it was fully cooperating with the special counsel's office and said it didn't register as a foreign agent for its ECFMU work because that group had misrepresented itself. The Podesta Group said it registered its work for ECFMU instead with Congress, based on what it said was faulty information the non-profit had provided and an outside legal opinion on the matter. The ECFMU had given the firm a statement attesting that it wasn't an arm of a foreign government, the Podesta Group said.

The Podesta Group said previously that it retroactively filed a disclosure after discussions with the Department of Justice.

Skadden performed its own work for Ukraine and also advised Mercury on whether it needed to register its work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Gates admitted as part of his cooperation deal that he had misled Skadden regarding whether the nonprofit was linked to the Ukraine government, a step he knew would avoid triggering Mercury and the Podesta Group to register their work under the FARA statute, according to court filings.

Mercury, too, submitted retroactive FARA filings.

Another former Skadden lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty in February to lying to the special counsel's office, admitting that he misled investigators about his discussions related to Skadden's work for the former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, in preparing a report on the trial of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

Court filings say that after one of the discussions van der Zwaan lied about, he called the senior partner at Skadden who worked on the report and partially recorded that call. The court papers didn't name the senior partner, but van der Zwaan's attorney identified the partner in a court proceeding as Craig.

The special counsel prosecutor involved in that proceeding, Andrew Weissmann, said in court that van der Zwaan had given an advance copy of the report to a public-relations firm that had been retained by the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and "had lied to the senior partner on the matter about what he had done."

"When asked about that by the senior partner, he lied and said he had no idea how they got an advance copy," Weissmann said. Weissmann also indicated that Skadden "had insisted on being able to write such an independent report."

Van der Zwaan completed a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year.

Craig exited the Skadden firm in April.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told lawmakers on Thursday he wants to scrap a pay raise for civilian federal workers, saying the nation's budget couldn't support it.

In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Trump described the pay increase as "inappropriate."

"We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases," the President wrote.

An across-the-board 2.1% pay increase for federal workers was slated to take effect in January. In addition, a yearly adjustment of paychecks based on the region of the country where a worker is posted -- the "locality pay increase" -- was due to take effect.

Trump said both increases should no longer happen.

"I have determined that for 2019, both across the board pay increases and locality pay increases will be set at zero," he wrote.

Congress has an opportunity to effectively overrule the President's edict if lawmakers pass a spending bill that includes a federal pay raise. The Senate passed a bill this summer that included a 1.9% raise for federal workers. The House's version did not address federal pay. Senate and House negotiators will negotiate a final measure in the coming weeks.

Trump's 2019 budget proposal, released earlier this year, included a pay freeze for civilian federal workers. It's not clear if Trump would approve a budget that includes the pay increase; the White House has not issued a formal veto threat of the Senate's bill.

In his letter, Trump stressed a pay freeze would not affect the federal government's ability to attract qualified workers, and wrote the government would focus on "recruiting, retaining and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skill sets."

The implications of Trump's decision on the locality pay increase were not immediately clear. Workers based in more expensive parts of the country are paid higher salaries to compensate for the higher cost of living.

In his letter, Trump wrote the locality increase in 2019 would average 25.70% and cost the federal government $25 billion. But he did not say whether the locality adjustments already in place would remain in effect and the White House did not immediately clarify.

Pay for military personnel will not be affected by Trump's decree; instead, US troops are due a 2.6% pay increase next year. Trump frequently trumpets the military pay raise while listing his administration's accomplishments. The raise came as part of a massive $716 billion defense spending bill that Trump signed earlier this month.

That measure, along with a new two-year federal budget and tax cuts heralded by Republicans, have led to accusations Trump is ignoring the federal deficit, despite promising he would address it as president. The tax plan alone is expected to increase the deficit by $1.4 trillion over 10 years, according to a government estimate.

In ordering the raises canceled, Trump cited his statutory authority to adjust pay because of "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare." Yet the President frequently touts a growing US economy, including a strong growth rate for the gross domestic product and low unemployment

"These numbers are very, very sustainable -- this isn't a one-time shot," he said last month after figures showed the US economy grew at a 4.1% annual rate in the second quarter of the year.

The pay raise matter was the latest in a string of moves that reflect an attempt to rein in spending on federal employees. Trump signed executive orders in May that made it easier to fire federal employees and placed limits on public-sector unions. A judge struck down most of those provisions last week.

Reaction on Thursday from Democrats was swift, particularly those from states adjacent to Washington, where large numbers of federal workers reside.

"Zero. This seems to be how much respect President Trump has for federal workers," wrote Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, in a statement. "It is outrageous and hypocritical that after spending billions of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations -- and as the President boasts about the 'great' state of the American economy, that suddenly the White House finds that there is zero money left to pay a minimal cost-of-living adjustment to the patriotic, dedicated public servants."

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, wrote: "Let's be clear: The President's decision to cancel any pay increase for federal employees is not motivated by a sudden onset of fiscal responsibility. Today's announcement has nothing to do with making government more cost-efficient -- it's just the latest attack in the Trump administration's war on federal employees."

While the Washington area contains the largest concentration of federal workers, only 1-in-6 civilian employees of the government live in the region.

The state with the largest number of federal workers is California, followed by Virginia, the District of Columbia and Texas. States Trump won in 2016 -- including Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio -- also rank high on the list of states where federal employees work.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday defended his response to the death of Sen. John McCain in an interview with Bloomberg News.

Trump told Bloomberg, "No, I don't think I did at all," when asked if he missed a chance to unite the country and whether he had made a mistake. Trump had faced criticism for failing to issue a laudatory statement about McCain after his death and waffling over whether to keep flags at half-staff days after McCain died.

"I've done everything that they requested and no, I don't think I have at all," the President said.

The Arizona Republican died on Saturday at the age of 81 after battling brain cancer

Following McCain's passing, Trump tweeted that his "deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain," in a brief message that did not directly praise McCain or his service to the country. It wasn't until Monday that Trump issued a longer statement on the late senator saying that he respected McCain's service.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A majority of Americans think President Donald Trump will lose his re-election bid in 2020, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS , similar numbers to those facing former President Barack Obama at this point in his first term ahead of his re-election victory.

Fifty-four percent of Americans say they expect Trump to lose his campaign for re-election, the same number who said Obama would lose the 2012 election at this point in his first term. Only 40% of Americans think Trump will win in 2020, similar to the 44% who said the same for Obama.

Republicans overwhelmingly say they expect Trump to win re-election to the White House in 2020 (79% feel that way), while Democrats nearly unanimously say they expect him to lose (87% say so). A majority of independents also expect him to lose. Republicans now are more optimistic about Trump's re-election prospects than Democrats were about Obama (just 69% of Democrats said they expected Obama to win at this point in 2010).

Former President Bill Clinton faced even worse expectations in 1995, when only a quarter of Americans expected him to win his second term following deep losses for his party in the 1994 midterm elections. Trump filed re-election paperwork with federal election officials on Inauguration Day in 2017. He formally announced his re-election bid in February.

Republican presidential primary 2020

Trump holds strong support among his own party's potential voters in a 2020 primary race. Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 75%, say they think the GOP should re-nominate Trump in 2020. Only one in five, 20%, say the GOP should nominate a different candidate. These numbers are virtually identical to Obama's support among Democrats at this point in his term.

But when those who want to see someone else take the party's nomination are asked to name an alternative to Trump, no potential candidate has a clear edge. None of the potential nominees raised by respondents earn more than 1% support; that list includes Vice President Mike Pence, former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, television personality Oprah Winfrey and retiring South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.

Speculation about a Republican primary challenge has swirled around some anti-Trump GOP voices like Ohio Gov. John Kasich, outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who have refused to rule out a run for the White House.

Democratic presidential primary 2020

Former Vice President Joe Biden holds the most widespread support when potential Democratic primary voters are asked to rate the chances they would support six possible candidates for the party's 2020 nomination.

A broad 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they are likely to support a Biden bid for the Democratic nomination, two-thirds of whom say they are "very likely" to back his candidacy.

Large majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents also say they are likely to support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (75%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (68%). Still, this support is slightly less intense than Biden's: Six in 10 likely Sanders backers say they are "very likely" to support him and less than half of Warren's likely supporters say they are "very likely" to support her.

Both Biden, 75, and Sanders, 76, have not ruled out bids for the White House in 2020. Warren has said she isn't running

About half of potential Democratic primary voters say they are likely to back California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Roughly one in five say they aren't sure if they'd support those latter three, lesser-known possible candidates. Only two in 10 potential Democratic voters overall say they are "very likely" to back Harris and Booker; only one in 10 are "very likely" to support Gillibrand.

Sanders still has the strongest grip on young voters in the Democratic party: 60% of potential Democratic primary voters under 35 say they are very likely to back Sanders vs. 52% for Biden, 29% for Warren, 18% for Harris, 16% for Booker and 12% for Gillibrand.

Among potential Democratic primary voters, racial divisions also play a role. Six in 10 nonwhites, 61%, say they are very likely to back Biden's candidacy vs. 52% of whites who say the same. On the flip side, 39% of whites are very likely to back Warren's bid vs. only 25% of nonwhites.

The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS March 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.
__label__politics (CNN) Health care was the top issue referenced in campaign advertisements ahead of the US Senate primaries in Arizona and Florida on Tuesday, driven largely by Democratic messaging.

The focus on health care illustrates the Democrats strategy to largely avoid messaging around President Donald Trump's scandals in Washington and instead drive home issues they believe resonate more with voters.

In Arizona's Republican Senate primary, the candidates' efforts to tie themselves to Trump were on full display in TV ads.

Immigration and security have also colored ads in the Arizona race, and entitlements, taxes, and term limits have been points of emphasis in Florida.

Over $42 million worth of TV advertising has blanketed the airwaves in the two states through the week of August 28.

Arizona

A CNN analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG ad data shows how Republicans in Arizona's competitive Senate race have focused on immigration and security issues in their TV advertising, while also emphasizing their pro-Trump bona fides. Those were the top three TV ad themes by spending through the week of August 21 -- "immigration" ($2.45 million), "pro-Trump" ($1.77 million), and "public safety" ($1.58 million).

One of the top ads from Rep. Martha McSally touches on all of these themes, particularly the race to be the most "pro-Trump" candidate. It's a critical issue for McSally, the establishment favorite, and a former Trump critic who is facing a robust Republican primary contest against two outsider candidates -- Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio -- in the mold of Trump who have adhered to his brand of politics and seized on polarizing immigration issues.

In the spot, McSally says she's "working with President Trump to secure our border and keep Arizona families safe," promising to "crack down on sanctuary cities," "enforce the law," and "build the wall" on the US-Mexico border. The ad features a clip of Trump praising "my friend Martha McSally," and an Arizona Republic piece declaring McSally "Arizona's most reliable vote for the Trump agenda."

Another ad from One Nation, a pro-McSally conservative outside group, also focuses on immigration and security issues. "They illegally cross our border -- criminals, violent gang members, and drugs, putting us all at risk," a narrator says over images of the border and ICE agents, before praising McSally and fellow Arizona Rep. David Schweikert for their efforts on border security issues.

On the other side, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and liberal outside groups have made health care central to their messaging. Democrats have spent over $3.46 million on "health care" ads, with "taxes" ($1.58 million) and "veterans affairs" ($1.1 million) the second- and third-most discussed topics.

In one of Sinema's ads , she recounts her family's struggle with health care costs. "We were just kids when my dad lost his job. We lost our car, we lost our home, and we lost our health insurance. I know what it's like for a family to struggle to make ends meet," Sinema says in the spot. "Health care needs to be more affordable."

Meanwhile, Red and Gold -- a mysterious super PAC with links to Arizona Democrats that formed close enough to the primary date to avoid disclosing its donors until after the contest -- has been one of the most active outside groups in the race, spending over $1.6 million on a wave of ads targeting McSally that include a number of health care spots . In one of those ads, a couple from Oracle, Arizona, detail their struggle with health care costs.

"Every month I write a check for our health insurance. It's out of control," Kim Schweitzer says in the ad. "It hurts." Larry, her husband, references McSally's vote for the GOP attempt at repealing Obamacare, saying: "Martha McSally voted for this five-time cost increase for health insurance. I mean, I don't know how anyone can afford it. I don't get it, I don't know what Martha McSally is thinking."

Across advertisers from both parties in Arizona, "health care" was the top issue by spending ($4 million), followed by "immigration" ($2.7 million), "taxes" ($2.1 million), "public safety" ($2.1 million), and "terrorism" ($1.77 million) and "pro-Trump" ($1.77 million).

Florida

In Florida, as in Arizona, health care has been the dominant TV ad theme -- though Florida has seen more than three times the amount of TV ad spending so far, with incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Scott already locked in a fierce general election battle.

Across both parties, candidates and outside groups have spent $14.7 million on ads discussing health care (with $9.7 million of that total devoted specifically to ads about Medicare). Health care ad spending was ahead of "taxes" ($14.1 million), "Social Security" ($7.69 million), and "social issues" ($5 million) and "term-limits" ($5 million).

Broken down by party, Democrats have put the greatest emphasis on health care ($7.98 million), followed by "social issues" ($5 million), "call to action" spots ($2.9 million) and "Social Security" ($2.9 million).

For example, an ad from Senate Majority PAC, a leading Democratic outside group, features an ER doctor listing health care issues and criticizing Scott's policies as governor while praising Nelson's efforts. "We got an opioid crisis, a doctor shortage, seniors struggling to pay for care, but even with all that, Rick Scott vetoed millions in health care funds and refused federal health care funds that would have covered 750,000 Floridians. Bill Nelson took on the insurance companies, forcing them to cover people with pre-existing conditions," Dr. David Woolsey says in the spot.

And an ad from Majority Forward -- a group affiliated with Senate Majority PAC -- also hammers Scott for "veto[ing] nearly $200 million in health care funds" as governor, "slashing home health care for seniors and vaccinations for kids," and "cutting doctors at rural hospitals and treatment for opioid addiction" -- "instead, Scott backed his party and gave tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy," the ad's narrator says.

The Republican tax cuts, and tax policy generally, have been a key theme in GOP messaging in the Florida Senate race. Florida Republicans have spent $11.29 million on ads discussing taxes, while also stressing health care ($6.75 million) and "term-limits" ($5 million) -- a tactic conservatives have seized on to cudgel Nelson, a four-decade veteran of politics.

A top Scott ad hits Nelson over both the longevity of his Washington career and his opposition to tax cuts. "In 1978, the Ford Pinto was the best-selling small car in America, gas was 63 cents a gallon, and Bill Nelson was elected to Congress. Forty years later, a lot of things change, but Bill Nelson is still in Washington," a narrator says over a series of retro images. "349 times, he's voted for higher taxes."

Term-limits and Nelson's lengthy career are another recurring theme. An ad from New Republican PAC -- which has spent over $5 million on the ace so far -- ticks through Nelson's career, starting in 1972 when he was elected to the Florida legislature, and repeatedly criticizes him for liberal tax policies before closing with, "after 45 years, it's time to term-limit Bill Nelson."

The Republican approach to health care messaging in Florida, meanwhile, has been to target Democrats over the long-term viability of Medicare. One of Scott's ads argues that Democratic policies threaten the program's future: "You pay for Medicare your entire career -- your parents paid into Medicare their entire lives -- but Washington is letting Medicare crumble," a narrator says. "Bill Nelson voted to cut $716 billion from Medicare -- no wonder it's going bankrupt."
__label__politics (CNN) Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, was allegedly "abusive" to his colleagues, loosely handled prescription pain medications and was periodically intoxicated, even crashing a car once while drunk, according to allegations detailed in an explosive document compiled by Senate Democrats.

The document, written by Democratic staff on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, lists a range of allegations detailed by what they say are 23 current and former colleagues of Jackson.

Lawmakers have not yet substantiated these details and are investigating them further.

Among the most damaging allegations: Jackson was drunk and "wrecked a government vehicle" while at a going-away party. It also says that "on at least one occasion" Jackson "could not be reached when needed because he was passed out drunk in his hotel room."

The documents did not include further significant details, the document states, in part to "protect the identities of those involved."

__label__politics (CNN) Parts of an operation linked to Russian military intelligence targeting the US Senate and conservative think tanks that advocated for tougher policies against Russia were thwarted last week, Microsoft announced early Tuesday.

The disclosure, coming less than three months ahead of the 2018 midterms, demonstrates new ways in which Russia is attempting to destabilize US institutions. The news also places additional pressure on President Donald Trump to take action, even though he downplayed Russia's involvement as recently as Monday.

In its announcement, Microsoft said it executed a court order giving it control of six websites created by a group known as Fancy Bear. The group was behind the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and directed by the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit, according to cybersecurity firms.

The websites could have been used to launch cyberattacks on candidates and other political groups ahead of November's elections, the company said.

Microsoft said the domains were "associated with the Russian government and known as Strontium, or alternatively Fancy Bear or APT28." The company said it has no evidence that the domains were used in successful attacks but that it was working with the potential target organizations.

Microsoft argued in court that the domains were posing as some of its company's services.

"Attackers want their attacks to look as realistic as possible and they therefore create websites and URLs that look like sites their targeted victims would expect to receive email from or visit," Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a blog posted to the company's website on Monday night.

Although the websites could be used to trick members of the Senate and think tanks, they also could have been used to dupe other people or entities that interact with them.

Think tanks have criticized Russia

JUST WATCHED Microsoft stops Kremlin-based hackers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Microsoft stops Kremlin-based hackers 01:24

Hackers could have used the domains to send emails to Senate staffers or people working for the Hudson Institute or the International Republican Institute in an attempt to trick them into handing over information, like their passwords.

This form of attack, known as spearphishing, was successfully used to target Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta in 2016. Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's staff was similarly targeted by a Russian group last year. McCaskill has said the attempt was unsuccessful , and Microsoft took control of the domain that targeted her staff via a court order in Virginia earlier this year.

Among the websites for which a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia granted Microsoft control were those with domain names designed to resemble sites used by congressional staff. They include "senate.group" and "adfs-senate.email."

Other domains were designed to look like they were related to the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, and the International Republican Institute , whose board includes six serving senators, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Gen. H.R. McMaster.

Both think tanks have been critical of Russia.

The Hudson Institute runs the Kleptocracy Initiative, which has an advisory council with several Russia experts and focuses on revealing how "financial secrecy fuels globalized corruption and threats to democracy" and frequently scrutinizes on the Kremlin.

The International Republican Institute has been working to promote democracy since the 1980s and receives funding through the US State Department, US Agency for International Development and the National Endowment for Democracy. IRI has also been critical of Russia, and the Russian Federation labeled the group an "undesirable organization" in 2016.

The institute's board of directors includes several Republicans in Congress. Arizona Sen. John McCain led the board earlier this year and Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan took over for McCain. Both have been critical of Trump.

"This apparent spearphishing attempt against the International Republican Institute and other organizations is consistent with the campaign of meddling that the Kremlin has waged against organizations that support democracy and human rights," Daniel Twining, IRI's president, said in a statement Tuesday morning. "It is clearly designed to sow confusion, conflict and fear among those who criticize (Russian President Vladimir Putin's) authoritarian regime."

Kremlin denies involvement

The Kremlin on Tuesday denied any knowledge of attempts to interfere in US elections.

"Our reaction has already become traditional: we don't know which hackers they are talking about, we don't know what is meant about the impact on elections," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a CNN question. "From the US, we hear that there was not any meddling in the elections. Whom exactly they are talking about, what is the proof, and on what grounds are they reaching such conclusions?"

He added, "We don't understand, and there is no information, so we treat such allegations accordingly."

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump -- who has openly and repeatedly questioned US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of harming Hillary Clinton's campaign to aid his bid -- blamed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the matter for undermining his efforts to improve relations with Moscow.

Mueller's investigation has "played right into the Russians -- if it was Russia -- they played right into the Russians' hands," the President said.

But the President's own Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, delivered a speech at the Hudson Institute last month, in which he called Russia "the most aggressive foreign actor" participating in efforts to undermine American democracy.

Also last month, the Justice Department announced indictments against 12 members of the GRU, as part of Mueller's investigation, for allegedly disseminating information it had stolen from the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016.

The indictment laid bare how two units of the GRU had been allegedly responsible for the intrusions, putting names to a group that had only been known under monikers like Fancy Bear and APT28.

Recent attacks

The news comes less than a week after it emerged that two Democratic congressional primary candidates were hacked earlier this year.

The campaigns of Dr. Hans Keirstead and David Min, both of whom lost in California's June primaries, were breached, but the groups responsible for the attacks have not been made public and may not be known.

Microsoft said Monday that, in light of the ongoing threats to political groups in the US, it was launching a specialized cybersecurity protection service called AccountGuard.

The company says it will offer the service to all candidates and campaign officials, as well as think tanks and political organizations that use Microsoft Office 365, at no additional cost.

The initiative is part of Microsoft's Defending Democracy Program, which it launched in April. The company said it plans to roll out AccountGuard in other parts of the world.

This story has been updated with additional context about the Russians' attempted interference.

(CNN) John McCain once took on Hillary Clinton in a drinking contest. It was at a restaurant in Estonia in 2004, during a congressional tour. Both politicians managed four shots of vodka; the rules were unclear, but Hillary -- McCain's one-time political rival -- was declared the winner, according to the restaurant proprietor (though in her own account, Clinton said they "agreed to withdraw in honorable fashion," rather than name a winner).

That image sums up the humanity and character of the late Senator McCain, who will be mourned deeply on both sides of the political aisle. He embodied a more moderate brand of conservatism -- one that could separate politics and friendship -- that now feels distant and very much missed.

He should have been elected President in 2000, when he ran for the Republican nomination and lost, and if he had made it to the White House, America might have forged a new consensus around a smaller state and a cleaner politics.

Today the country is divided in ways that McCain despaired of. But it should be united in grief for a genuine American hero.

When McCain tried again for the presidency in 2008, this time winning the Republican nomination, the country found itself blessed with real choice. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, was intelligent and eloquent, the voice of young America. McCain represented the best that the previous generation had to offer.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) US Defense Secretary James Mattis warned Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is "not unconditional" and urged them to "do everything humanly possible to avoid any innocent loss of life."

His remarks came after the Pentagon issued a warning to the Saudis that it is prepared to reduce military and intelligence support for its campaign against rebels in neighboring Yemen if the Saudis don't demonstrate they are attempting to limit civilian deaths in airstrikes following a strike on a school bus that killed 40 children earlier this month.

Two officials directly familiar with the Pentagon's thinking tell CNN frustration is rising. Mattis and General Joseph Votel, head of US military operations in the Middle East, are particularly concerned that the US is supporting a Saudi-led campaign of airstrikes that have killed large numbers of civilians.

Human rights groups, some members of Congress and the United Nations have expressed concern about Saudi Arabia's actions for months to little avail. But after a series of recent strikes in which large numbers of civilians were killed, the Pentagon, as well as the State Department, have now delivered direct messages to the Saudis about limiting civilian casualties. "At what point is enough enough?" one official remarked to CNN.

Speaking at the Pentagon, Mattis said the US is "constantly reviewing" the support given to the Saudi led coalition in Yemen.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The alleged Russian spy Maria Butina should be released from jail and placed on house arrest, her attorneys argued in a court filing Friday that seeks to paint her as a humble student whose interactions with Americans and Russians are overblown by prosecutors who indicted her for acting illegally as a foreign agent.

Specifically, Butina's defense team describes her relationship to Russian billionaire Alexander Torshin, who allegedly mentored her in attempts to infiltrate Republican politics, as "actually just a friend."

Her lawyers also included a text message chain in which a married gun rights advocate whom Butina allegedly offered to sleep with in an attempt to gain political influence said he would "never sleep with a redhead" like Butina.

Butina, 29, has been in jail -- first in Washington, now in Alexandria, Virginia -- since July 15, when she pleaded not guilty to the foreign agent charges in DC federal court. Butina's house arrest request will be discussed at a court hearing on Sept. 10, the judge said.

The Siberian-born former American University graduate student allegedly built Republican Party connections through gun rights groups including the NRA and through the National Prayer Breakfast as a way to push pro-Russian interests, prosecutors charge.

__label__politics (CNN) Several factors that pollsters look at are predicting a "blue wave' in the fall elections, and some observers are calling 2018 the "year of the woman" given the number of female candidates running across the country. And it seems female voters are getting ready to strengthen the Democratic Party.

In CNN's June poll , half of voters said they'd vote for a Democratic candidate in the upcoming midterm elections, with 42% saying they'd vote for a Republican. This question is colloquially referred to as the generic ballot, and it's a useful measure of how the two parties will perform in an election.

There are other predictors that find a "blue wave" is coming as well.

First off, more people (especially women) are planning on voting for the Democratic candidate this year. This is somewhat expected since the opposing party holds the presidency and majorities in both chambers of Congress.

The amount of people saying they'll vote for the Democratic candidate has increased by 5 percentage points in total, by 1 percentage point among men and by 8 percentage points among women compared with near this time before the midterm elections in 2014. The men's vote for the Republican candidate also has increased, but only by 2 percentage points, while female support for the GOP has dropped by 10 percentage points.

__label__world (CNN) — Mozambique's coastline stretches about 2,470 kilometers along the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, and most of its beaches remain in pristine condition without hordes of tourists or tacky boardwalks.

But even in a country blessed with immense natural beauty, the Bazaruto Archipelago, a group of six islands off the coast of Vilankulo, are a standout destination

Here you'll see horses kick up sand and spray on the edge of the clear blue water, while just a few feet away, unspoiled coral reefs flash brilliant colors below the surface.

Most of Mozambique's coast lies undeveloped because of the country's past tragedies -- the 10-year war for independence from Portugal and the 20-year civil war that followed.

However, the splendor of Bazaruto has been intentionally protected.

For decades the islands have formed part of a marine park that shields it from the country's recent boom of offshore drilling for natural gas.

Local fishing villages, home to about 3,000 people, are still allowed to ply the waters in traditional dhow sailboats, slender vessels that formed the backbone of a medieval trading system stretching the length of Africa's east coast.

The lack of commercial fishing has kept the reefs intact, making it one of the few places in the world where visitors can simply wade into the warm waters and watch the lives of sea creatures close to the surface.

Bazaruto's isolation and protection have also guarded one of the world's last populations of dugongs, also known as sea cows, the giant underwater grazers on the verge of extinction.

Elite tourism

Land redistribution programs in Mugabe-era Zimbabwe saw Pat and Mandy Retzlaff pushed off their farm at the turn of the century. With their animals and those abandoned by their neighbours, the Retzlaffs set off for a new life in Mozambique with 104 horses in tow.

Made up of Bazaruto, Benguerra, Magaruque, Banque, Santa Carolina and Shell, the islands of Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago, have a long history of exclusive tourism.

In Santa Carolina, a luxury hotel catered to the world's elite in the 1950s in a locale dubbed "Paradise Island" during colonialism's last oblivious hurrah.

That was an era when Mozambican beaches were glamor destinations known for sun, surf and sex appeal, enshrined in popular culture of the era in songs like Bob Dylan's " Mozambique ."

That all fell apart as the drive for independence gained strength, and the ruins of the Santa Carolina hotel sit as a reminder of that myopic time.

During the war years, these central beaches and islands were mainly escapes for wealthy white Rhodesians and later Zimbabweans of all races.

In the 1990s, full-board stays at charming lodges cost about $50. Access to the island was on wobbly light aircraft or wobblier dinghies.

Trey Graham, a Washington-based culture critic, remembers visiting Bazaruto from Zimbabwe in 2001 on a small aircraft piloted by a man with a machete scar across his face, landing on a grassy airstrip.

"The grass airstrip is my most vivid memory -- especially once we got in the Land Rover, with the bags in the little cart behind it, and bumped our way around the edge of the airfield through the tall grass, past the wreckage of what I've always assumed to be the previous shuttle to the island," he said.

"When I tell people the story, I tell them the skeleton of the pilot was hanging out the window, like in [the 1984 movie] 'Romancing the Stone' or something.'"

"And there were maybe four people there with us the whole week? And that was including our pilot, who as I recall never left the bar."

That year was when the country's fortunes reversed, as Zimbabwe slid into political and economic turmoil while Mozambique turned itself into one of the world's fastest growing economies.

Horse rescue mission

One of the best ways to explore this beautiful landscape is on horseback. Mozambique Horse Safari

Pat and Mandy Retzlaff were caught up in those changes, when they were pushed off their farm in Zimbabwe during then-president Robert Mugabe's land reforms.

They started taking in horses that had been abandoned when neighboring farmers fled.

"My passion for horses, that probably started before I was born. It's in my genes," Pat Retzlaff said.

"The idea with the horses at the beginning was, this is temporary. You know, all these horses are being slaughtered.

"Let's take some in, so we can give them back when things get to normality, which unfortunately it never did."

Eventually they ended up with about 300 horses.

Determined to find a new home for themselves and the animals, they decided to move to Vilankulo, which had the advantage of a small international airport as well as serving as the gateway to the Bazaruto Archipelago, though at the time the town had little else. Even telephones were new then.

"People bond with horses. Once that bond has become firm, it's very difficult just to discard the animal," he said.

"The alternative was just to put them all down. There was nothing else we could do."

They spent years earning the trust of the communities and learning the landscape.

Around 30 horses died after eating unfamiliar poisonous plants. Their new neighbors had no idea what they were seeing.

"They never knew what horses were, so it was a mixture of fascination and fear," Retzlaff said. "They saw the horses as big dogs, with big teeth."

Wave of success

People like to bond with the horses. Mozambique Horse Safari

Their business grew, and they now offer four and seven-night horse safaris to explore the beaches of Vilankulo and meet nearby communities.

Six of the horses now live on Benguerra Island, the second largest island in the Bazaruto Archipelago, including four of the original Zimbabwean horses and two rescued locally in Mozambique.

"There's a lot of challenges to horses to keeping horses on an island," said Charlotte Levens, who cares for the animals on Benguerra.

"There's nothing really set up for horses in this country, let alone on this island. Everything has to come in from the mainland, so there's a lot of planning and co-ordinating."

"We offer two main activities, the swimming with the horses, which is a bareback beach ride, and then we take the horses into the ocean, which is just such a beautiful experience."

"The horses love island life," she adds, describing how they wade neck deep into the water and roll on the sand when they emerge.

"There are no fences on the island, so they have free rein really."

On Benguerra, visitors can stay in a handful of luxury casinhas at the &Beyond Benguerra Island resort (Benguerra Island, Inhambane, Mozambique; +27 11 809 4300).

Visiting the archipelago now costs upwards of $500 a night, but there won't be many more people around than Graham remembers from his first visit.

However access to the islands has greatly improved, with helicopter and boat service from Vilankulo.

There's only a few choices of accommodation, all top-end, and set up to help guests experience the area's unique natural beauty.

"Bazaruto is not just a beach destination," said Mark Havercroft, Africa regional director of Minor Hotels, which includes the Anantara Bazaruto Island Resort (Bazaruto Island, Inhambane; Mozambique; +258 84 304 6670).

(CNN) A cornerstone of American democracy is faith in elections to deliver a fair result. Today, that trust is under threat. Most recently, 12 Russian agents were indicted over interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.

How do we ensure Americans' belief in the vote?

One option is to put votes on a blockchain, which is a kind of record keeping. Blockchain's most famous application is bitcoin, the digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain, or distributed ledger, that is verified by computers around the world. The bitcoin blockchain allows money to travel around the globe without the help of a bank or a government. The cryptography behind blockchain makes it difficult to tamper with it without someone noticing. This is why some refer to blockchain as a " truth machine ."

Blockchain is now being applied to everything from humanitarian aid to supply chains -- and many industries that want a record that resists the interference of a third party.

In May, West Virginia became the first state to use blockchain in a federal election. A limited number of absentee military, orUniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act,voters used a blockchain-based mobile application. This was intended to be safer and more convenient than mailing in an absentee paper ballot.

"Whether a Soldier is without mail service in the mountains of Afghanistan, or a Sailor is in a submarine under the polar icecap, they deserve the opportunity to participate easily in our democracy," said West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican.

Blockchain was an attempt to keep those mobile votes secure. Absentee voters cast their ballots via their smartphones, and then their votes were recorded on a blockchain -- in addition to a traditional cast vote record. The results of the vote are still under audit, but if all goes well, in the midterm elections, West Virginia will bring blockchain voting to UOCAVA voters in the state's 55 counties.

"Blockchain is becoming more and more attractive for people who are looking for a transparent and immutable record -- that is something that can be audited," Donald Kersey, elections director and deputy legal counsel at the West Virginia secretary of state's office, told me. Kersey said there wasn't much opposition to the pilot, in part because it was so limited in size. West Virginia has not publicized exactly how many voters participated in the pilot, but Kersey acknowledged it was not a large number.

Kersey noted that in West Virginia, all voting machines have a backup paper record, or a "voter verified paper trail," as do many other states. "For those that don't," he said, "I doubt blockchain is the best answer -- mainly because it would require connection to the internet." So, while blockchain might help mobile voting become more secure, Kersey doesn't foresee blockchain becoming part of the voting machine discussion anytime soon.

If West Virginia extends blockchain voting to UOCAVA voters in all 55 counties, the pushback could increase. "There are always concerns about the unknown," Kersey said. "The word 'pioneer' is most applicable here. Lewis and Clark had no idea what was west of the Mississippi."

As for the voters themselves, many probably didn't even know that the system used blockchain. While I was not able to get direct access to the voters who participated in the pilot, some appeared to appreciate the convenience. "I've been living in Japan for 17 years, and I've missed a lot of stuff stateside," one person who successfully voted told Voatz, the startup that worked on the West Virginia blockchain pilot. "This system gives me an opportunity to engage again with so much ease."

Blockchain technology appeals to those who trust math more than human beings. Nimit Sawhney, CEO of Voatz, explains that for a computer to add any data to the blockchain, it has to first solve a difficult puzzle. The puzzle is hard to solve, but easy for other people to check. "You can't cheat math," he told me. "One plus one is two."

In a blockchain, every block is mathematically linked to the one before it. "Let's say you found a way to tamper with the most recent transaction," Sawhney said. "You have to tamper with everything before it, and remain undetected, before the next vote comes in. You would need to do it in a fraction of a second." This would make it very difficult for Russians, for example, to hack a blockchain. "Even with the most powerful computer they have, it would take 25 years to hack one vote."

In the case of West Virginia, military voters first verified their identity via government-issued IDs and face recognition. They cast their votes via Android or iPhones, and then those votes were stored on a blockchain.

The West Virginia blockchain did not use bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. Unlike bitcoin, which is decentralized and open to everyone, in West Virginia only nodes with permission could participate. Nodes are computers that cryptographically verify updates to a blockchain.

Sawhney says that in the very near future, stakeholders, such as voters, independent auditors, nongovernmental organizations and all major political parties can apply to become a node. While some will still criticize this kind of blockchain for not being fully decentralized, having multiple political parties verifying the blockchain might help assuage fears that one party will unduly influence the process.

Sound too good to be true? Some think it is. "How do you know that the votes you put on the keyboard of your phone get on the blockchain?" asked Stanford University computer science professor David Dill.

By involving Android or Apple phones, you are giving Silicon Valley companies even more power than they already have. "Suppose there's a group of programmers at Google. They have strong opinions about who should be elected for office, and no scruples," Dill told me. "I don't want Apple to decide who the president is. I don't want Google to decide who the president is." Many Americans don't trust the government, but some trust Silicon Valley even less.

Josh Benaloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft Research, echoed Dill's concern. "If my vote is changed by malware before it ever reaches a blockchain, I will likely never know it, and the blockchain offers me no protection."

Pete Martin, CEO of Votem, a blockchain voting startup that is exploring the possibility of doing midterm elections in Montana, told me that it has already accounted for this problem. "We assume you have malware on your phone or desktop," Martin said. "When you cast your vote, that cast vote record has a mathematical proof around this encrypted package. By the time that our servers get it, we check to see if anything was changed in that packet. ... If it was changed, we'll reject your vote."

It's good that people are raising questions about blockchain. If states apply it to something as critical as elections, they'd better get it right. But it's clear that something must be done. Perception matters. If Americans lose faith in elections, democracy will suffer.

Everyone in the elections world wants what's best for the voter and the votes, Kersey said. "Whether you're Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter. I don't think that anybody is going to put a wall up against something that works, that is secure."
__label__politics (CNN) Dr. Ronny Jackson exuded confidence when he emerged from a Capitol Hill office Tuesday evening, telling reporters that he looked forward to answering tough questions from lawmakers about his past.

By Thursday morning, Jackson was back in the White House basement, returning to his job as the President's physician after his nomination to become the next Veterans Affairs secretary was scuttled.

In less than 48 hours, Jackson was downgraded from a well-respected physician who served presidents from both parties to the latest casualty of Washington's scandal machine. Not since former President George W. Bush's 2005 attempt to elevate Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court has a high-level nominee been so thoroughly humiliated in the confirmation process.

But the process was especially ugly -- and swift -- for Jackson. His downfall was fueled by a laundry list of serious, but uncorroborated, allegations from nearly two dozen current and former colleagues that ultimately came together in a memo released by Senate Democrats with, according to sources, the tacit approval of Republicans.

This account of the final hours before Jackson withdrew his nomination Thursday morning is based on more than a dozen interviews with lawmakers, administration officials, congressional sources and veterans' groups. It depicts Jackson's surprise path to the nomination, the bipartisan concerns about the White House physician's conduct and the Trump administration's mad scramble to salvage a nomination that was, in many ways, plagued by self-inflicted wounds.

The interviews show that 15 months after taking office, the Trump administration is still struggling to professionalize its nomination process to ensure vetting is taken seriously and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are prepared for any surprises.

"We did him no favors," a White House official said Thursday, acknowledging the administration did not fully appreciate the magnitude of the task and the campaign that would rise up against Jackson's nomination.

The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on this story.

Surprise selection

Jackson's selection as the nominee to succeed embattled former VA Secretary David Shulkin came as a stark surprise to him late last month when the President summoned him to the Oval Office and asked him to take on the task of leading the sprawling agency. Jackson knew about the decision only a day or two before it was made public, an official said, a sign that inadequate vetting had taken place.

On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties openly questioned the President's decision to tap Jackson, one largely made out of personal affinity, and were skeptical that he had the experience to lead an agency that is known as a management boondoggle.

It wasn't Jackson's background that initially worried White House chief of staff John Kelly and others in the West Wing, but rather his lack of experience for the job. Kelly gently argued against the Jackson pick, an official said, but the President's mind was made up — and there was no obvious and immediate alternative.

After the White House officially sent his nomination to the Senate, Jackson appeared to be doing all the things a Cabinet nominee would typically do. He met with lawmakers privately to answer questions and submitted routine paperwork to the committee of jurisdiction, in this case the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.

But White House officials said that Jackson had far less help preparing for his confirmation than Cabinet nominees typically get, with one source telling CNN that the White House was "stretched thin" due to the other nominations making their way through the Senate, including Mike Pompeo's nomination for secretary of state and, his replacement at the CIA, Gina Haspel.

The source said three lower-level aides from the White House communications shop and a few others from the Legislative Affairs Office helped oversee preparations for Jackson's nomination.

"But that was it," the source noted, adding that the communications staff at the VA "basically sat on their hands" and refused to help throughout the process because they knew they could lose their jobs once a new secretary took over the agency.

Bipartisan concerns grew on Capitol Hill earlier this week about Jackson's conduct on the job. And the White House moved to defend Jackson against what they called false accusations. Jackson indicated repeatedly to reporters that he intended to stay the course even as negative headlines mounted.

Speaking at a Tuesday news conference alongside the president of France, President Donald Trump robustly defended Jackson as "one of the finest people I have met," but said that Democrats had launched an unfair attack on the White House physician's record.

He also hinted that Jackson may well not continue in the process -- and seemed to give him a window to leave.

"I don't want to put a man through a process like this," Trump said. "The fact is, I wouldn't do it. What does he need it for?"

On Tuesday, the top senators on the Veterans Affairs committee announced that they would postpone a confirmation hearing for Jackson scheduled the next day, pending further information. And they took an unprecedented step of writing a letter to the President, requesting "any and all communication" between the Pentagon, the White House Military Office and the White House Medical Unit "regarding allegations or incidents" involving Jackson dating back to 2006, the year he was tapped to serve as a White House physician.

The next day, Senate Democrats released an explosive two-page memo, based on the account of nearly two-dozen of Jackson's former and current colleagues, about his conduct, adding more detail to the accusations that led the committee to delay his confirmation hearing and further casting doubt that his nomination could survive.

Jackson's increasingly dire situation

Jackson's situation grew more dire over the last 24 hours.

Republicans on the Veterans Affairs committee were planning to begin increasing pressure on the White House to withdraw the nomination, according to a source briefed on the matter. They concluded that there was no path for Jackson to be confirmed. In private discussions with senators, Jackson himself was told that his confirmation prospects appeared to be waning given the narrow GOP majority in the Senate and the likelihood several Republicans would oppose him, the source said.

Making matters worse for Jackson, Republicans were unwilling to offer a public defense of Jackson. And they didn't know whether to believe his denials.

"He didn't say anything that didn't seem believable," said Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican who sits on the committee, referring to his meeting this week with Jackson, who denied doing anything wrong. "As it's so evident to me and others across the country, the question is: 'Who do you believe?'"

Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, the GOP chairman of the panel, had been kept apprised of ranking member Jon Tester's investigation over the last several days -- and viewed the sources of the allegations as serious enough to warrant a deeper probe.

Isakson told CNN he "never" told Tester to back off, or to avoid disclosing the allegations to the news media. "Everybody has to make their own decisions on that," Isakson said.

Last week, Tester's office began hearing from current and former employees of Jackson, raising alarms about his professional conduct. Suddenly, the calls began pouring in, with staff interviewing sources until 9 p.m. at one point. After interviewing about 25 people, Tester's office was still trying to track down key details, including the car that was apparently crashed when Jackson allegedly was driving while intoxicated, sources said. Jackson denied the allegation to reporters on Wednesday.

Tester continued to keep Isakson apprised of his investigation and his plans to go public. Isakson did not stop him.

"This was totally organic," Tester told CNN of the allegations that came his way. "We didn't have an advertisement. We weren't walking around saying anything about Admiral Jackson. We were concerned about, like I said, his ability to run an agency as big as the VA. This came at a different angle."

Privately, Republicans on the committee were perplexed. They couldn't find documentation from his past background checks that corroborated the allegations. But they came from credible sources that couldn't be ignored.

"I don't have a problem with the way it was completed," said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican member of the committee, referring to Tester's probe. Rounds had planned to meet with a senior White House official Thursday morning to ask questions about Jackson. "These are serious allegations -- unsubstantiated but serious."

Moran, the Kansas Republican, said he met with Jackson after the initial round of allegations were reported in the media. Jackson indicated he had done nothing wrong.

"I asked him if there were allegations out there, what would you want to tell me about that?" Moran recalled. "We talked about alcohol. The answer was, 'I've never taken a drink on duty.' We talk about prescription drugs, and he said it is highly regulated by the pharmacy."

Moran said that Jackson told him that he "might have a beer with the security crew when I'm not on duty."

Moran still was unsure.

"I indicated that I need to be convinced that this is the right person who could do a solid job," Moran said, referring to how he felt the moment that Jackson was nominated. "I had not reached that conclusion, and the more recent stories arrived and it became more complicated."

In the end, the respect and admiration for Jackson clouded the judgment of those in the West Wing. Trump wanted to offer Jackson a final lifeline on Wednesday by praising him to reporters — at least to help clear his name and rally some Republicans around his beleaguered nominee — but several advisers argued against it.

As late as Wednesday evening, Jackson was still working Capitol Hill in search of support for his nomination. But before sundown, Trump increasingly believed Jackson should step aside "before things get worse," an official familiar with the talks said.

Jackson returned to the White House Wednesday evening and told staffers he wanted to pull out, according to a White House official, saying that the scrutiny was too much for him and his family to bear. Jackson, the official said, was taken back by the vitriol of the process, even as he maintained that the mounting allegations against him were not true.

Jackson emerged from senior staffer's offices late Wednesday evening and told a group of waiting reporters: "Look forward to talking to you guys in the next few days."

By the time Jackson left the West Wing late Wednesday night and headed home, the plan was set to send out the announcement of his withdrawal around breakfast time Thursday, sparing him another day of twisting in the wind.

Inside VA headquarters

As the President's nominee to lead the agency seemed increasingly on the rocks, officials at VA's Vermont Avenue headquarters were working to show that even without a permanent secretary, things were running smoothly. The agency's current interim leader is Robert Wilkie, who also serves as a Defense Department undersecretary.

In a statement Wednesday, VA spokesman Curt Cashour said that since Shulkin was ousted from the department in March, "senior VA officials are now on the same page, speaking with one voice to veterans, employees and outside stakeholders," and that employees who were "wedded to the status quo and not on board with this administration's policies or pace of change have now departed VA."

But with Jackson's nomination scuttled, the White House is now back at the starting line to find a new nominee, leaving the Department of Veterans Affairs in a state of turmoil. In just the last four years, the agency has had two confirmed secretaries and three interim secretaries.

The President hinted on Thursday morning that he is already considering who could replace Jackson, and a senior White House official confirmed that was the case. Trump said during an interview on "Fox and Friends" that he might seek someone with more "political capability" than Jackson.

Another White House aide suggested that two names already in the mix are Ike Perlmutter, the Marvel Entertainment CEO who is a member of Trump's advisory board on veterans affairs, and Toby Cosgrove, a Vietnam War veteran, heart surgeon and former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic.

A former White House official who worked on veterans' issues suggested that Trump may consider Wilkie, a veteran who has previously been confirmed by the Senate, to lead the department on a permanent basis. But the leaders of some veterans' groups say he should have never been brought over to lead VA to begin with.

"We now face the prospect of a stunning eighth nominee for VA secretary since 9/11," said Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. "It's been an unprecedented time of chaos, political agendas and uncertainty. And millions of veterans and their families have paid the price."

Perlmutter and Cosgrove declined to comment for this story.

Reporting for work

Jackson reported for work early Thursday morning, before the decision that he would not continue the nomination process was public, wearing a red tie and a gray suit, not the military uniform he occasionally wears while working and that he donned as he strode between meetings with senators on Capitol Hill in the days prior.

A person who spoke to Jackson on Thursday morning described him as frustrated at allegations he claims were taken out of context, or were altogether false. While Jackson told confidantes he would have been willing to fight for his nomination, it was becoming increasingly clear that doing so would damage his reputation further.

As the White House announced that Jackson was withdrawing his name from consideration, Jackson was fetching a coffee from the White House mess.

Asked about his future, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that "Admiral Jackson is a doctor in the United States Navy assigned to the White House and is here at work today."

Meanwhile, preparations were underway a floor above for an event honoring wounded veterans -- a ceremony Jackson was originally slated to attend, but skipped after his nomination was pulled, according to a person familiar with the planning.

Without a Veterans Affairs nominee to tout, Trump instead lauded Wilkie, the interim leader. And he boasted he'd cleaned out the agency's bad actors.

"We have people that were terrible working there and they're gone," he said.
__label__politics (CNN) Chain link fences, mattresses on the floor and families queuing to be processed -- and oftentimes separated. These are the photos of the processing detention center in McAllen, Texas, that the Customs and Border Protection agency wants you to see.

More than 1,100 immigrants -- including children -- were being held at McAllen when reporters were allowed in Sunday.

Dozens of protesters stood outside the center as reporters and democratic lawmakers arrived to learn more about the facility where the Department of Homeland Security is processing and detaining immigrants accused of illegally crossing the border.

The lawmakers came to south Texas, they say, to learn more about the agency's processing of undocumented immigrants entering the United States, including a Trump administration policy to refer all people who cross the border illegally for criminal prosecution on top of immigration proceedings.

As a result of enforcing that policy, families who cross illegally have been separated from their children because those accompanying the children are put into the criminal justice system.

Though media was able to tour the facility Sunday, they were barred from taking any pictures or video. CBP cited privacy concerns as the reason.

The agency released a handful of government images for publication -- showing McAllen through the lens of those controlling it.

Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who first visited the South Texas border on June 3, described his second visit as more coordinated for Customs and Border Protection officials who gave the tour.

"We did see the children who were held inside here," he told CNN's Ana Cabrera in an interview.

"In wire-mesh, chain linked cages that are about 30x30, a lot of young folks put into them. I must say though, far fewer than I was here two weeks ago.

"I was told that buses full (of children) were taken away before I arrived. That was one of my concerns, that essentially, when you have to give lengthy notice, you end up a little bit of a show rather than seeing what's really going on in these centers."

The warehouse-like facility has holding pens made from chain-link fences on the inside separating the immigrants.

Mattresses with thermal blankets were strewn on the floors.

Federal officials said the immigrants were only being processed and wouldn't be here longer than three days, but lawmakers reported they'd been told by immigrants within the facility that they had been there for seven.

Customs and Border Protection provided CNN with a document titled "Next Steps for Families" during the walk-through.

The document lists several steps for those in the government's custody and includes several actions for people to take under the question "how do I locate my children," including telephoning agency call centers and hotlines or emailing them.

CNN's Dianne Gallagher reported that families are brought through the warehouse and separated by the adults' gender, and that one woman approached CNN, crying and expressing fear about what would happen next.

The group of lawmakers included Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Texas Reps. Filemon Vela, Vicente Gonzalez, and Sheila Jackson Lee, Vermont Rep. Peter Welch, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan.

Speaking after visiting McAllen several Democrats expressed anger at the family separations and called on the Trump administration to change its policy.

"When you have a mother tell you directly that she's in fear that she will never see her child again, and when the United Nations Human Rights Commission indicate to the Trump administration that you are violating human rights, then you know that what we are saying today is President Trump, cease and desist," Jackson Lee said.




__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's calling on the military to guard the US-Mexico border until his long-promised border wall is complete.

"I told Mexico, and I respect what they did, I said, look, your laws are very powerful, your laws are very strong. We have very bad laws for our border and we are going to be doing some things, I spoke with (Defense Secretary James) Mattis, we're going to do some things militarily. Until we can have a wall and proper security, we're going to be guarding our border with the military. That's a big step," he said during a luncheon with leaders of the Baltic states.

He continued: "We cannot have people flowing into our country illegally, disappearing, and by the way never showing up for court."

Asked to clarify his comments during a joint news conference, Trump said he is "preparing for the military to secure our border" and he would be attending a meeting on the topic of border security with Mattis and others "in a little while."

Trump has privately floated the idea of funding construction of a border wall with Mexico through the US military budget in conversations with advisers, two sources confirmed to CNN last week . His remarks Tuesday come on the heels of multiple days of hardline immigration rhetoric from the Trump White House, with the President calling on Congress to pass strict border laws in a series of tweets beginning Sunday.

__label__politics (CNN) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will introduce a resolution to rename the Senate's Russell office building after the late Sen. John McCain.

In a statement Saturday night, a short time after McCain died, Schumer said, "Nothing will overcome the loss of Senator McCain, but so that generations remember him I will be introducing a resolution to rename the Russell building after him."

"As you go through life, you meet few truly great people. John McCain was one of them," Schumer said. "His dedication to his country and the military were unsurpassed, and maybe most of all, he was a truth teller -- never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare. The Senate, the United States, and the world are lesser places without John McCain."

Schumer's call to rename the storied Senate office building after McCain was a nod to the deep, bipartisan friendships McCain amassed throughout his career in the Senate.

A top Republican leadership aide was unaware of Schumer's proposal and told CNN it would take time to research it before commenting.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Thirteen years ago next week, President George W. Bush was grappling with his administration's mishandling of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast when he suddenly had an opportunity to appoint the next chief justice of the United States. At his side was staff secretary Brett Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh, now President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, has said he remains struck by the "enormity of it all," a hectic set of days that represent, with the destruction in New Orleans and more than 1,000 related deaths, one of the darkest marks on Bush's domestic efforts. Those days also led to the choice of John Roberts to succeed William Rehnquist, who died on September 3, 2005.

In a 2015 speech, Kavanaugh asserted that his nearly six years with Bush, "especially my three years as staff secretary, were among the most interesting and most formative" in his development to be a judge. Kavanaugh in the same March 2015 speech at Marquette University referred to that early September week as "one of the worst weeks of the Bush presidency."

Yet presidential records of Kavanaugh's crucial time as Bush's staff secretary are not available to senators who will begin confirmation hearings Tuesday. Even the records that have been released, from Kavanaugh's three earlier years as a White House associate counsel, are substantively meager.

A CNN review of the documents found that many are items from the mass circulation of schedules, "talking points" and announcements and news clippings. The personal emails are frequently trivial or cryptic. Some are also redacted or missing the full chain of responses. Of about 270,000 pages released so far, a CNN analysis shows, only about 3% contain emails that appear to be written by Kavanaugh himself.

As a whole, the documents add little to the portrait of an individual poised for a lifetime appointment on the nation's highest court.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has limited the records requested for release from the National Archives, has argued the focus should be on Kavanaugh's 12 years as a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The staff secretary job, Grassley said earlier this month, was "a non-legal position and wouldn't reveal anything about Judge Kavanaugh's legal thinking."

The committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, has countered that the staff secretary documents "are critical to understanding his knowledge of and involvement with torture, warrantless wiretapping and the use of signing statements, to name just a few key issues." The National Archives, which holds the presidential records, has said it is following its longstanding practice of responding only to document requests from the committee chairman, irrespective of which party is in power.

The controversy might, perhaps, be viewed as a sideshow in the politically polarized confirmation process. Yet the result is a major gap in the public understanding of a lawyer who held one of the most important jobs at the White House at one of the most important times for the country.

A president's staff secretary, overseeing the flow of information to the executive, can serve as one of his most trusted policy advisers and while not a well-known position, it has been held by well-known strategists, such as John Podesta, staff secretary to President Bill Clinton.

Throughout his time in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh was involved in the robust screening of candidates for the nation's powerful US appeals courts. He has told audiences that when he and other lawyers began in early 2001, the attitude was "pedal to the metal." His tenure covered several controversial nominees, including some who were blocked by Senate Democrats, and two appointees who eventually made it to the Supreme Court, first named to the DC Circuit Roberts, and Neil Gorsuch, whom Bush put on the Denver-based 10th Circuit and whom Trump named to the high court last year.

Yet the records released from his White House counsel days fail to illuminate Kavanaugh's work in this area. There is no window into his views of competing candidates for prominent vacancies or his strategic thinking when certain Bush choices were impeded by Senate Democrats.

The current White House counsel Don McGahn has demonstrated how much that office can assist in carrying out the president's broader agenda with the selection of leading conservative thinkers for the bench. McGahn steered Trump's selection of Kavanaugh to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Amid domestic controversies over Katrina and judicial appointments during Kavanaugh's tenure, Bush also wrestled with post-September 11 anti-terrorism policy. Kavanaugh's role in Bush's policies involving the detention of terror suspects and their torture is certain to be raised in the Senate hearings. Some Democratic senators already have accused him of misrepresenting his involvement in such matters when he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2006, for his current seat on the DC Circuit.

White House spokesman Raj Shah said Kavanaugh testified "accurately," adding, "He was not involved in crafting legal policies that formed the rules governing detention of combatants."

Fights over documents are perennial

Documents from a nominee's work behind the scenes in government can be more revealing of his or her thinking than published statements and the carefully choreographed public testimony of Senate hearings.

Kavanaugh has observed in public speeches that his work in the Bush administration involved disputes over executive branch records. One such clash occurred during the 2005 Bush nomination of Roberts, first to succeed retiring Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and then to be chief justice following Rehnquist's death.

Bush's nomination of Roberts to be an associate justice was pending when Rehnquist died in the middle of the Katrina tragedy. Bush decided to elevate Roberts to the chief position. Then, for the O'Connor vacancy, Bush first chose White House Counsel Harriet Miers. When fellow conservatives protested that she lacked credentials, Bush turned to Samuel Alito, confirmed in January 2006.

No documents related to Kavanaugh's work on those nominations have been made public.

In the 2005 Roberts' records flap, the White House ensured production of the nominee's records from his years in the Reagan administration, where Roberts first served as a special assistant to the attorney general and then in the White House counsel's office.

Democratic senators had also wanted documents from Roberts' time as a deputy solicitor general in the George H.W. Bush administration. Those were held back as the Bush administration characterized his work in the US Solicitor General's office, which represents the government before the Supreme Court, as similar to work for a client. Such documents were also withheld by the Barack Obama administration when former solicitor general Elena Kagan was nominated for the Supreme Court in 2010. (She also had served in the Clinton White House, and those materials were made public during her confirmation hearing.)

The vast Reagan documents revealed some of Roberts' thinking on racial issues, women's rights, abortion, and religious liberty. All became grist for Senate questioning. Even with some controversy over his conservative stands in memos, Roberts was confirmed 78-22.

President Bush credits Kavanaugh with helping choose Roberts when Bush was torn, first, on a successor to O'Connor.

Bush was focused on Appeals Court Judges Roberts, then on the DC Circuit, Alito, on the Philadelphia-based Third Circuit, and Michael Luttig, then on the Richmond-based Fourth Circuit. "Brett told me that Luttig, Alito, and Roberts would all be solid justices," Bush recounted in his memoir, "Decision Points." "The tiebreaker question, he suggested, was which man would be the most effective leader on the Court -- the most capable of convincing his colleagues through persuasion and strategic thinking." Bush said he believed that would be Roberts.

Two months later, when Rehnquist died abruptly, he quickly decided to switch the nomination of Roberts, who had received early positive reviews from individual senators but had not begun Senate confirmation hearings.

For his part, Kavanaugh recounted the frenzied hours after he was alerted to Rehnquist's death late on a Saturday night. "I was responsible for hustling into the White House right away, contacting the president, immediately getting out a presidential written statement, and working with the speech-writers to help prepare the president's remarks," he said in a speech last year.

"When all of us met with the President in the Oval Office on Sunday morning, it did not take long for the president to settle on nominating John Roberts for the Rehnquist vacancy," Kavanaugh said.

The next morning Bush announced Roberts' nomination.

Then, said Kavanaugh, "we all took off for another trip to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. ... The enormity of it all -- Katrina, Rehnquist, Roberts -- still hits me when I think about it in retrospect."
__label__world (CNN) The Chinese government is conducting a mass, systematic campaign of human rights violations against Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang, a new Human Rights Watch (HRW) report claims.

HRW's report comes after a United Nations committee last month raised alarm at the "numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities held incommunicado and often for long periods, without being charged or tried, under the pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism."

Responding to the latest allegations, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Geng Shuang accused Human Rights Watch of being "biased on China" and refused to comment on the specific allegations contained in the report.

In a statement, HRW China director Sophie Richardson said the Chinese government was "committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades."

Enforced loyalty

HRW researchers interviewed 58 former Xinjiang residents, including five people who claimed to have been detained in camps and 38 relatives of alleged detainees. According to their testimony, which supports the information provided to the UN and independent reporting on the region by international media, since 2014 the authorities in Xinjiang have stepped up mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.

"The detainees in political education camps are held without any due process rights -- neither charged nor put on trial -- and have no access to lawyers and family," HRW said.

"They are held for having links with foreign countries, particularly those on an official list of '26 sensitive countries,' and for using foreign communication tools such as WhatsApp, as well as for peacefully expressing their identity and religion, none of which constitute crimes."

The report compared the situation to that seen during the Cultural Revolution -- the decade long civil conflict that rocked China during the 60s and 70s and saw widespread abuse of religious and ethnic minorities.

Former detainees claimed they were beaten and abused in detention, and forced to sign patriotic songs entitled, "Without The CCP, There's No New China," and "Socialism is Good."

"Before meals, we had to stand and say; 'We feel grateful for the Party, grateful for the Motherland, (and) grateful for President Xi;' that 'We wish President Xi good health, that the Motherland is prosperous, and that the ethnic groups are in harmony,' before we were allowed to sit down and eat," a former detainee called Nur told HRW.

During political classes, detainees "had to learn about the rules and regulations, like 'We are resolutely against 'the three evil forces,'' the 32 rules that you must memorize like, 'we are against religious extremism' that we have to 'support the Party.' "

Official paranoia

Like Tibet, Xinjiang -- which has a history of independent rule and largely non-Han Chinese population -- has always been viewed with some suspicion by the authorities in Beijing, fearful it could become a hotbed of separatist, or in its case, Islamist organizing.

During the Sino-Soviet split, the concern was that Moscow would use the province to sow chaos within China, following the fall of the Berlin Wall suspicion shifted to US activity in the region, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan. Since 9/11 and the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corresponding boom in violent Islamist extremism, Beijing has massively ramped up security operations in Xinjiang, fearful that terrorists could take hold on its western border.

While there have been attacks in Xinjiang and other parts of China linked to Islamist terrorist groups, most analysts agree that the threat is limited. However, there are reliable reports of Uyghur fighters operating in Syria alongside the so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad.

Photo taken in February 2018 shows police officers patrolling in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China.

This paranoia regarding Islamist extremism has often spilled over onto ordinary Muslims , who have seen restrictions placed on marking Ramadan, growing long beards, wearing veils and home-schooling their children. Many have also been ordered to surrender their passports.

Since 2014, Communist Party officials have also conducted regular visits to Muslim households, a policy which drastically expanded this year, with more than a million cadres sent to live with families in "home stays," during which they receive "political education."

Activists say the regional government, now led by a hardline loyalist to Chinese President Xi Jinping, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs, but also increasingly relied on both high-tech tools and mass mobilization programs to keep the population in check.

In addition to the "home stay" initiative and the political education camps, they cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65.

This photo taken on February 27, 2017 shows Chinese military police attending an anti-terrorist oath-taking rally in Hetian, northwest China's Xinjiang region.

Political correctness

The detention camps -- which reports estimate between 100,000 and 1 million mostly Muslim residents of Xinjiang have passed through -- appear to have evolved from the home stay program, with similar goals.

Former detainees say they are indoctrinated against the "three evil forces" of "separatism, terrorism, and extremism." In order to guard against these forces, they are told to memorize new rules, such as avoiding Islamic greetings, using Chinese characters rather than the Uyghur script, ending communications with relatives in 26 predominantly Muslim countries, and avoiding discussing religion and politics online.

"If they resist, or officials deem they have failed their lessons, they are punished. They may be subjected to solitary confinement, not be allowed to eat for a certain period, or required to stand for 24-hour periods, among other punishments," said HRW researcher Maya Wang.

"The repression also has an impact outside of China. Many ethnic Uyghurs and Kazakhs live abroad, and the crackdown has been tearing families apart. Some family members may be held in Xinjiang and cannot leave because authorities have confiscated their passports, or they have been detained, and the other part of the family is outside of China."

Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, farwest China's Xinjiang region on September 16, 2014.

Concern has been growing over the camps -- which have been referred to in Chinese state media but not officially acknowledged by the government -- for months now, with activists using satellite photos and testimonies from former detainees to raise the alarm.

As well as the UN report last month, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers called for Chinese officials involved in alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang to be sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Act -- the 2012 law originally designed to freeze the assets of certain Russian government officials and businessmen accused of human rights violations.

"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominately Muslim ethnic minorities in 'political reeducation' centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response," they said in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

In response to the letter, MOFA spokeswoman Hua said that on the issue of human rights "the Chinese record is better than even the US so the US is really not in a position to judge China on this issue in this regard."

"China is committed to ensuring the religious freedom of the Chinese citizens," she said, adding she hoped US lawmakers "can stop this kind of bias and stop hurting the mutual trust and cooperation between the China and the US."
__label__politics Canada keeps strict import quotas on dairy products and applies steep tariffs on products coming in that exceed the quota. The tariffs range from 200% to 300%.

Access to Canada's dairy market wasn't part of the original NAFTA deal, which generally lifted all tariffs on goods traded between Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

The move hurt a few big dairy companies based in New York and Wisconsin, said Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University.

Some of the United States' 40,000 dairy farmers say they have also been hurt this year by tariffs imposed by China and Mexico in retaliation to those imposed by President Trump on imports of steel and aluminum.

"Our dairy farmers are facing dire economic conditions this year, and the Canadian pricing scheme and tariffs are curtailing much-needed markets for US dairy products," said Jim Mulhern, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, earlier this year.

Several industry groups have lobbied for a rewrite of NAFTA to eliminate or reduce Canadian tariffs on dairy, as well as the recently implemented barriers to imports of milk ingredients.

Overall, the NAFTA deal struck in 1994, has been good for US dairy farmers because it opened up the market in Mexico. Dairy exports to Mexico have increased five-fold since the trade deal was enacted, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.

Despite Canada's tariffs, the United States sends far more dairy products to Canada than the other way around. In 2016, the United States exported $557 million of dairy products to Canada and received about $113 million, according to the Canadian Dairy Information Center.

Canada is far from the only country to protect its dairy industry. Many countries help out their farmers with quotas, tariffs and pricing systems. The United States has tariffs on some milk products, too, and American farmers benefit from government subsidies.

US dairy farmers have the support of at least 68 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. The legislators urged top US negotiator Robert Lighthizer to make sure a new NAFTA deal would address Canada's protectionist dairy policies i n a letter sent in April. Congress must ultimately approve a new version of NAFTA.

Last week — after about a year of negotiations — Trump struck a preliminary trade agreement with Mexico and threatened to leave Canada out of an updated version of the three-country pact. But negotiators from all three countries have said they will continue to work toward a trilateral deal.

The Trump administration notified Congress last week that it could enter into a new trade deal with Mexico, but legislative procedure would allow Canada to enter into the agreement up until September 30 — when the text of the trade pact must be submitted to Congress.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said that his negotiating team will defend the country's dairy policies.

"I'm not going to negotiate in public, but what I have said time and time again is that our government, and I personally, will stand up to defend supply management and our dairy farmers," Trudeau said on Friday.

Canadian dairy farmers have relied on the protectionist policies since the 1980s.

"If Canada has to give up and reform the whole (dairy) system, it's going to have a gigantic impact," Novakovic said.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) He was a war hero who survived more than five years of torture as a prisoner in Vietnam and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, but it's John McCain's role as a legislator that may have most defined his public life.

A two-term congressman and a senator for more than three decades, McCain shaped US policy on everything from immigration to foreign policy, spoke out against the country's use of enhanced interrogation practices during the George W. Bush administration and irrevocably changed the very body in which he served.

On Friday, McCain came home to the Senate one last time, becoming only the 31st person to lie in state in the US Capitol, a rare honor reserved for government officials and military officers. While minutes before the sun had shone over the dome, as McCain, carried by an honor guard, ascended the steps, the clouds opened and rain poured down.

Shortly before 11 a.m., McCain's body entered the Capitol Rotunda. They set the casket atop President Abraham Lincoln's catafalque, a wooden structure that has been used for decades for such services. McCain's former colleagues looked on.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a man who at times fought on the opposite side of McCain on issues like campaign finance, remembered McCain as a tough political opponent.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against a Catholic foster care non-profit in Philadelphia that refuses to certify married same-sex couples as prospective foster parents out of religious objections to same-sex marriage.

In a one sentence order, the justices let stand a lower court ruling that had blocked Catholic Social Services from taking on new applicants to its foster program.

The ruling is a loss for Catholic Social Services, which had asked for an emergency injunction while the dispute plays out in the lower courts. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas noted they would have granted the request. It would have taken five votes to grant the request, but it's unclear what the final vote count was because justices don't have to publicly reveal their vote in such situations.

The group receives city funds when it places a child in foster care, but it will not comply with Philadelphia's anti-discrimination ordinance that the city says requires all groups that certify prospective parents to do so regardless of the applicants' religion, race, marital status or sexual orientation.

A lower court blocked the charity from taking any new candidates to serve as foster parents while the case plays out in the lower courts. The ruling meant that there would not be any new placements of foster children within the non-profit's in home foster care program.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt enlisted the help of an aide to inquire about the possibility of a business opportunity with the fast food chain Chick-fil-A, according to emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request from the Sierra Club.

The Washington Post first reported Tuesday that following outreach from an aide, Pruitt had a call with an individual in the company's legal department. A representative for Chick-fil-A, Carrie Kurlander, told the newspaper that the call involved "an expression of interest in his wife becoming a Chick-fil-A franchisee."

Kurlander said that the EPA administrator's wife "started, but did not complete, the Chick-fil-A franchisee application" and added that Pruitt's wife is not now and has never previously been a franchisee for the company.

CNN has reached out to Chick-fil-A for comment, but has not yet received a response. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox declined to comment to the Post and did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

The news is the latest in a series of actions by Pruitt that have raised questions over his ethical judgment as EPA chief.

__label__world (CNN) Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will issue a formal apology to child sexual abuse victims, as part of the government's response to a sweeping five-year inquiry in institutional child abuse.

The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse released its final report last December, describing a "serious failure" by Australia's institutions to protect child victims and listing 409 recommendations.

The landmark report estimated that tens of thousands of children had been abused in Australian churches, youth groups, care homes and schools, in what the commission described as a "national tragedy."

The report comes amid worldwide calls for institutional change, most notably from Pope Francis who has said he felt "ashamed" of the Catholic Church's failure to listen to victims of child sex abuse.

Recommendations from the Royal Commission

Speaking before Parliament on Wednesday , Turnbull seemed to echo the Pope's sentiment as he praised survivors for speaking out and promised them redress.

"For many of you, the royal commission was the first chance you had to be heard, to be have your pain acknowledged and most importantly to be believed," he said.

"You were believed and the wrongdoers have been brought to account. Your courage has helped expose the scale of institutional child sexual abuse in our country."

Turnbull said that the government would accept or accept in principle 104 of the 122 recommendations that fell under the commonwealth's jurisdiction, while the remaining 18 underwent further consideration. "The Australian Government has not rejected any of the Royal Commission's recommendations," Turnbull said in a statement.

Turnbull said he would deliver a national apology on October 22 to the victims of child sexual abuse, timed to coincide with National Children's Week. Other measures include appointing an Assistant Minister for Children and Families and implementing a Commonwealth Child Safe Framework.

The most significant move is the establishment of a National Redress Scheme , one of the Royal Commission's key recommendations, which will begin on July 1 and run for 10 years. Other outside institutions have also joined the Scheme, including the Catholic Church, Anglican Church, Uniting Church, Salvation Army, YMCA and Scouts.

In following with the Royal Commission's recommendations, the government will make yearly progress reports for the next five years, and conduct a review after 10 years.

"It's a very, very positive step," said Cathy Kezelman, the president of Blue Knot Foundation, which helps adult survivors with childhood trauma. However, she noted that "there are a lot of aspects to recovery."

"The prime minister made these statements and they're fantastic, but we need to see them happen," she said. "The proof is in the implementation and in the ongoing scrutiny to ensure that things really do change and that the children really are safe."

Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson (middle) is the highest ranking Catholic official to be convicted of covering up sexual abuse.

In May Australian Archbishop Philip Wilson became the highest ranking Catholic official to be convicted of covering up child abuse. He was removed from his post as Archbishop of Adelaide earlier this month. He's due to be sentenced on June 19 and faces up to two years in prison.

Cardinal George Pell , the most senior member of the Catholic church to ever face sex assault charges, is due to face trial in Melbourne soon on multiple counts of historical abuse. Pell is on leave from his role as Vatican treasurer while he contests the claims. He vigorously denies all charges.

Allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church stretch across multiple countries with large Catholic populations, including Austria, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and perhaps most famously, the United States, where children accused more than 4,000 priests of sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002, according to a report compiled by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Justice Department on Thursday sought to modify a federal court order that limits the ability of US officials to detain immigrant children longer than 20 days.

The move is part of the department's execution of President Donald Trump's new executive order designed to keep families together and will likely prove an uphill climb for Justice officials, as the request has already previously been denied under the Obama administration.

After an outcry against the Trump administration's separation of undocumented immigrant parents and children at the US border, the President reversed course on Wednesday by signing an order that aims to keep far more families together.

The crux of the legal issue that the Justice Department is now grappling with stems from a 1997 settlement agreement in Flores v. Reno and subsequent rulings limiting the detention of children to 20 days. Trump's executive order calls on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to request to modify the Flores settlement.

A Justice Department spokesman said, "Irrespective of the court's decision in Flores, it is incumbent for Congress to finally act to keep families together, end catch and release, and create the foundation for an immigration system that serves the national interest."

Justice Department lawyers want US District Judge Dolly Gee in California to modify that rule to give the Trump administration maximum flexibility to detain families -- not only until their criminal proceedings conclude, but also through the end of any asylum proceedings, which could potentially drag on for many months.

"Exemption from this requirement is tailored to address the immediate influx with which the Government is currently dealing, while providing time for ongoing efforts in Congress to address these issues," Justice Department lawyers wrote in Thursday's court filing. "Relaxing these requirements would permit family units to be kept together in appropriate facilities."

As part of its request, the DOJ asks the court to "exempt ICE family residential facilities from the Agreement's state licensure requirements," arguing that "these changes are justified by several material changes in circumstances -- including the worsening influx of families unlawfully entering the United States at the southwest border."

The court filing also states, "Under current law and legal rulings, including this Court's, it is not possible for the U.S. government to detain families together during the pendency of their immigration proceedings. It cannot be done."

Trump administration officials over the past week have regularly suggested their hands were tied under the Flores settlement and later court decisions.

"Pursuant to these court decisions, minors detained as part of a family unit cannot be detained in unlicensed facilities for longer than a presumptively reasonable period of 20 days, at which point, minors must be released or transferred to a licensed facility," according to a "Myth vs. Fact" statement provided by Homeland Security.

But that assertion leaves out the fact that "zero tolerance," the decision to prosecute 100% of illegal border crossings, presented the Trump administration with a policy choice: Keep families together, releasing them into the US on electronic monitoring, or split them apart. Trump chose to split the families at the border -- thereby complying with Flores by not detaining the children, but also prosecuting adults.

In 2015, Gee ruled that the Obama administration's extended detention of undocumented mothers and children had violated the Flores agreement -- setting up the court settlement that now imposes the 20-day limit on holding children with their families.

"The whole point of Judge Gee's decision was to avoid the prolonged and unnecessary detention of children,"said Stephen Legomsky, a former Obama administration DHS official. "Now that she's seen the level of suffering that an unfettered President has elected to inflict on children, I would imagine that if anything her resolve will be even stronger."

Bob Ferguson, the attorney general in Washington state, the same one who successfully sued over the travel ban, announced Thursday that he will lead a coalition of nine states to challenge the President's executive order.

Separately, three undocumented immigrants currently in detention who say they were separated from their children filed a federal lawsuit in DC Wednesday evening, seeking to be reunited with their children.
__label__world (CNN) Australia's Catholic Church has rejected calls for priests to be compelled to report child abuse revealed in confessionals.

The Church said Friday it would accept "98%" of recommendations made by a high-level government inquiry into child sexual abuse, which uncovered shocking accounts of widespread abuse inside Australian religious institutions.

But church leaders said that they would maintain the sanctity of confession, arguing to remove it would infringe on religious liberties.

"The only recommendation we can't accept is removing the seal of confession," Sister Monica Cavanagh, president of Catholic Religious Australia said at a press conference.

The Church's decision to reject the recommendation remains a stumbling block for some. It comes amid a tumultuous week for the Catholic Church as pressure builds on Pope Francis to ensure abusers within the church are held to account.

It comes amid a tumultuous week for the Catholic Church as pressure builds on Pope Francis to ensure abusers within the church are held to account.

Addressing crowds in Dublin, Ireland last weekend, the Pontiff spoke of his shame over the "appalling crimes" committed in recent decades and called for forgiveness from those who had suffered.

Royal Commission findings

The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard testimony from more than 8,000 people, who gave evidence in private sessions, over a period of five years.

During the inquiry it emerged that 7% of priests in Australia had been accused of abusing children, including over 40% of brothers in some orders.

A total of 2,559 referrals were made to authorities, including the police, as a result of the $383 million (AU$500 million) probe.

The final report delivered in December included 189 new recommendations to address a "serious failure" by Australian institutions to protect children, including 20 for the Catholic Church alone.

While the church said it had accepted almost all of the recommendations, it added that a large number would be only be put into effect pending approval from the Vatican. That includes one recommendation to consider voluntary celibacy for priests.

Peter Gogarty, a child abuse survivor, told ABC Radio he thought there was a bit of "clever play on words" going on in the Church's response to the recommendation.

"A great many of these recommendation it has said that it accepts in principle but subject to it doing more work or research ... It's not as rosy as the Church has tried to paint it, but as I said I remain cautiously optimistic that we are certainly in a more child safe environment," Gogarty told local media.

Seal of confession is 'inviolable'

The one recommendation it said it wouldn't adopt was the suggestion that priests be compelled to report to authorities any admissions of abuse made by priests in the confession box.

Sister Cavanagh said the Church was "deeply committed to both child safety and seal of confession, which we consider inviolable. We don't accept that safeguarding (children's safety) and the seal are mutually exclusive."

Under Roman Catholic law, priests risk being excommunicated if they divulge what's been said in confession, either by their words or actions.

"The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason," according to the Vatican.

Mandatory reporting differs between Australia's states and territories but in most places professional carers must tell authorities about suspected cases of child abuse.

Advocates say the "seal of confession" shows the church puts itself ahead of children.

"I think it's appalling that the Catholic Church is not putting the safety of Australian children as their number one priority ... We don't live under canon law," Leonie Sheedy, chief executive of Care Leavers Australasia Network told CNN.

Sheedy said the Australian public was "fed up" with the church, and it was "insulting" that Australia's Catholic leaders said they had to refer back to the Vatican for approval to make the reforms.

"Why can't they make decisions themselves and put the safety of Australian children first?" she said.

In a statement released June, the Church said it "welcomed" the report and had already begun its work to respond to the recommendations "including measures to standardize approaches to child safety and research to help prevent child sexual abuse in the future."

Groundbreaking report

The landmark Royal Commission report described the abuse of children in Australia's religious institutions as a "national tragedy."

"We now know that countless thousands of children have been sexually abused in many institutions in Australia. In many institutions, multiple abusers have sexually abused children," the report said.

"We must accept that institutional child sexual abuse has been occurring for generations."

At the time of its release, McClellan, stated that the issue of child sex abuse was an ongoing issue.

"The sexual abuse of children is not just a problem from the past. Child sexual abuse in institutions continues today," he said. "In some case studies into schools the alleged abuse was so recent that the children are still attending school."

Archbishop Mark Coleridge, President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said that while the Church would not remove the seal of the confessional, it was willing to admit the failures of the past and change to regain the public's trust.

"We make the pledge 'never again.' There will be no cover up. We will respond quickly to accusations, improve governance structure, be more transparent and we will listen," he said.

"We know that only actions not words can rebuild trust, and until trust is rebuilt all the apologies in the world will miss the mark." ​
__label__world (CNN) Vietnam has jailed 12 members of a US-based anti-government organization with roots in the Vietnam War, including two US citizens accused of plotting to bomb an international airport.

Those jailed included Nguyen James Han and Phan Angel, both US citizens. They will be deported from Vietnam after the completion of their 14 year jail terms, the Vietnam News Agency said.

Pope Thrower, a US embassy spokesman in Hanoi, said consular staff will "continue to monitor Mr. Nguyen's welfare, advocate for him, and provide consular services until his release."

"We have no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad," Thrower added. The embassy has not been authorized to speak on behalf of Phan.

While Vietnam routinely jails bloggers, activists and rights lawyers who are critical of the government, Nguyen and Phan's case has shone a light on the continued operation of US-based opposition groups, decades after the end of the Vietnam War and normalization of relations between Hanoi and Washington.

At least two of those groups have been accused of carrying out terrorist activities in Vietnam with the purpose of achieving regime change in the communist nation.

However, details about the groups and the severity of their actions remain unclear, with both the Vietnamese government and the organizations themselves having a vested interest in exaggerating their role and influence.

Nguyen James Han, an American citizen who is a member of California-based Provisional National Government of Vietnam was sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Aspiring government in exile

Both Nguyen and Phan belong to the Provisional National Government of Vietnam (PNGV). The organization was formed in the early 90s by former soldiers and officials from the former US-sponsored South Vietnam, which was defeated by the North in 1975.

The PNGV is headed by self-proclaimed Prime Minister Dao Minh Quan and not recognized as an official government in exile by any other countries.

Vietnamese state media claims that after the group's establishment, Quan and other leaders recruited followers in Vietnamese refugee camps in Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia. "The recruited refugees were later repatriated in order to conduct terror and sabotage activities in Vietnam," according to the Vietnam News Agency.

PNGV's website says it grew out of the New Democracy Movement, which formed in 1985 to demand "free and fair election(s) for Vietnam."

"One of the important goals of the New Vietnamese Democracy is to unify all the hope and desire of the freedom-loving Vietnamese to become a National Resolution to discharge the dictatorship of communist in Vietnam," it says.

The website prominently features letters from various US Presidents and other high-ranking officials which refer to Dao as Prime Minister, most of which appear to be pro forma replies to letters sent by members of the PNGV.

For example, a 2005 letter signed by Melissa Bennett, special assistant to then President George W. Bush, apologizes for a delay in responding to an unspecified invitation from the PNGV, and communicates Bush's "best wishes."

Quan did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the imprisonment of Nguyen and Phan or information about his group's activity in Vietnam.

Alleged terrorists

According to Vietnamese authorities , the PNGV has been active within Vietnam itself since 2015, when the group's leaders in the US "instructed underground units in Vietnam to develop forces and establish 'volunteer delegations,' seek venues to set up bases, and purchase weapons to prepare for spontaneous and terror acts."

Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security claims that last year these efforts expanded to "aiming to terrorize, sabotage and assassinate officials," as well as carrying out attacks on police agencies and an attempted bombing of Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat airport.

The court heard this week that Nguyen and Phan -- the US citizens convicted -- were sent to the country "to develop their force and direct other members in the country to conduct anti-state activities."

These initially involved small scale events such as "distributing leaflets, hacking into radio stations to broadcast information about their organisation, and protesting against Taiwanese steel maker Formosa," but later escalated to "armed terrorist plots."

In sentencing the 12 PNGV members, the court said they had set fire to police stations, planted petrol bombs at Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat airport, and attacked a police station, injuring three people.

Last year, 15 people were jailed for their part in the airport bombing plot, according to Reuters , citing state media reports.

Anti-communist activity

While much of the PNGV's history is unclear, beyond the group's own accounts and limited information provided by the Vietnamese government, it seems to have filled something of a vacuum left by the self-proclaimed Government of Free Vietnam (GFV), which was founded in 1995 but has since disbanded.

An archived version of GFV's website called for dismantling "the suppressing system of Communist dictatorship of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam by a peaceful, democratic, humanity, practical and persistent approach."

Founded by former members of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces, the GFV, like the PNGV, claimed to be the natural successor to that administration, arguing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam formed after the end of the war is illegitimate.

A 2003 report from the US Justice Department describes the GFV as a "dissident group based in California," which reportedly operates "armed groups in bases within Laos and Cambodia along the Vietnam border."

"The group has claimed responsibility for a number of attempted bombings throughout Vietnam," the report said, adding the "Californian basis of the group has led to formal complaints to the US government by the Vietnamese government."

While the US has a long history of funding dissident and armed groups both overseas and at home, leaked State Department cables published by WikiLeaks suggest the GFV was not held in high regard by diplomats in Hanoi.

"On the specific issue of the (GFV's) office in Washington, the Ambassador remarked that opening an office is not illegal and, as far as we could tell, would have virtually no real significance in terms of damaging (Vietnamese) interests," a 2005 cable said

A later cable noted there was evidence GFV members "have plotted and carried out terrorist attacks on Vietnamese diplomatic missions in England, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines."

An immigration lawsuit in 2014 involving a member of GFV gives some insight into how those activities were carried out. In a judgment in favor of Vinh Tan Nguyen, the court recounted how he had served as a "vice commander" of a GFV jungle camp along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border.

Nguyen's brother tried to bomb the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok in early 2001, and he himself was arrested in the Philippines months later while in the planning stages of an attack against the Manila embassy.

While GFV has a long paper trail in leaked state department cables, government reports and lawsuits, PNGV is not mentioned in the WikiLeaks documents, nor was CNN able to find any reference to the group on US government websites.

The boy's remains were found when authorities raided a makeshift compound this month in New Mexico and discovered 11 other emaciated children on the property.

Prosecutors brought the first charges in connection with the boy's death Friday, revealing more details of what may have been the final hours of his life.

The boy's father, Siraj Wahhaj, 40 and his partner, Jany Leveille, 35, were charged with abuse of a child resulting in the death, a first-degree felony with a penalty of up to life in prison, court documents show. They were also charged with conspiracy to commit child abuse, also a first-degree felony.

Before that, the couple and three other adults arrested at the compound had only been charged with 11 felony counts of child abuse by New Mexico authorities.

Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice will retry a woman whom prosecutors say disrupted Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing for attorney general by laughing.

After rejecting a plea deal, Desiree Fairooz will again face charges of unlawful conduct for disrupting Sessions' hearing in January.

According to court records, Fairooz rejected a deal offered by prosecutors that would have required her to plead guilty in exchange for a recommended sentence of time served.

Fairooz was detained after audibly laughing after Sen. Richard Shelby told senators at Sessions' confirmation hearing that the then-Alabama senator had a record of "treating all Americans equally under the law."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court pick who could tilt American jurisprudence to the right for a generation, vowed to be neutral and impartial, shrugging off bitter Democratic demands for him to stall his own confirmation hearing until questions about his past are fully answered.

President Donald Trump's second pick for the nation's highest court sat silently for much of the day as Democrats staged an aggressive, coordinated effort to slow his apparent march to confirmation -- in exchanges that highlighted several potential 2020 presidential contenders, including California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.

In addition, Capitol Police said they made 70 arrests Tuesday for protests during the hearing and in other parts of Capitol Hill.

After seven hours of political sparring mostly aimed by senators at their constituencies outside the hearing room, Kavanaugh finally got the chance to speak, and delivered emotional tributes to members of his family and his friends -- but resolved none of the issues that Democrats say should derail his nomination.

In a comment that seemed to fly in the face of a day of political estrangement, he warned that the Supreme Court "must never be viewed as a partisan institution" and argued that "a good judge must be an umpire -- a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy."

__label__world Greece (CNN) An Australian Instagram influencer who was found unconscious on a superyacht in Greece had phoned her mother and brother in tears before her death, a lawyer acting for her family said Thursday.

Sinead McNamara "was crying and referring to an incident that took place onboard with another crew member," lawyer Haralambos Triandafylopoulos said in a statement.

The statement did not give any further details about the incident.

McNamara, 20, was found in a critical condition Friday on board the yacht docked in the port of Argostoli on the island of Kefalonia. She died while being airlifted to hospital. A coroner found that she had died by hanging.

Her family's lawyer said she was happy in the days before her death. "The parents also declare that Sinead did not have any problems, she was communicating with her family often and she was happy," the statement said. "In two days she was going to return to her family and friends in Australia. For the above reasons the family find it crucial that the conditions of her death be thoroughly investigated," the lawyer said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team is reaching back more than a decade in its investigation of Paul Manafort, a sign of the pressure Mueller is placing on President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman.

The FBI's warrant for a July search of Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, home said the investigation centered on possible crimes committed as far back as January 2006 , according to a source briefed on the investigation.

The broad time frame is the latest indication that Mueller's team is going well beyond Russian meddling during the campaign as part of its investigation of Trump campaign associates. Manafort, who has been the subject of an FBI investigation for three years , has emerged as a focal point for Mueller.

The search, an unusually hard-nosed tactic in a probe that centers on possible tax and financial crimes, began before dawn as Manafort and his wife lay in bed, according to sources briefed on the matter.

FBI agents entered with guns drawn and insisted on searching Kathleen Manafort for weapons, a standard part of FBI searches but a jarring event for the Manaforts, the sources said.

Mueller's team has warned Manafort that they are working to charge him with possible tax and financial crimes, the sources said, an indication the investigation could be in an advanced stage.

A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.

Manafort has previously denied financial wrongdoing regarding his Ukraine-related payments, his bank accounts in offshore tax shelters, and his various real estate transactions over the years.

Justice Department prosecutors concluded last year that there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges against Manafort or any of the other US subjects in the Ukraine probe, according to sources briefed on the investigation. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.

Mueller's team could be facing a deadline if they want to bring charges arising from older tax returns: The six-year statute of limitations for Manafort's taxes filed in 2011 expires October 15. They already may be too late for the years prior to 2011.

But the government could have more time depending on the exact nature of the charges that it wants to bring.

The period mentioned in the search warrant covers much of the decade that Manafort worked as a consultant for Ukraine's former ruling party. It's that work, which extended beyond the ouster of the president, Viktor Yanukovych, amid street protests in 2014, that prompted the FBI's interest in Manafort. Yanukovych's Party of Regions was accused of corruption and the FBI sought to learn whether the American consultants hired by the Ukrainian party, which also included Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group, were involved. The Justice Department probe also looked into whether the US firms violated the federal law that requires registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Mueller's office has subpoenaed reams of financial records from Manafort, in addition to the documents agents seized during the search, according to sources.

Investigators also have obtained Manafort's notes from the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who promised to provide negative information on Hillary Clinton, the sources said.

Manafort, who attended with Donald Trump Jr. and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, wrote notes on his phone during the meeting.

The notes portray a meeting largely focused on a Russian lawyer's complaints about investment fund manager William Browder and his role in pushing sanctions legislation to punish Russia . The Russian lawyer repeated claims that Browder made campaign donations to both parties as a way to pass a Russia sanctions law, according to sources briefed on the notes.

Manafort's lawyers also turned over a one-page document containing the notes to Congress, which is investigating as well.

The notes are disjointed, the sources who have seen them said, and appear to focus on Russia's frustration over a law passed in 2012 that led to frozen assets of powerful Russian officials.

Earlier news reports about the reference to political contributions in the notes have led to speculation that the meeting attended by Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner included a request for donations.

But people who have seen the notes say the reference is to political contributions that the Russian lawyer alleged Browder made.

According to another poll released Tuesday by USA Today-Suffolk University , 50% of registered voters support the Democratic candidate in their district while 39% prefer the Republican candidate -- an 11-point advantage.

Sixty percent of voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress "as a check on Trump," up from 52% saying so last summer, over keeping Republicans in power "to support Trump's agenda," per the ABC News-Washington Post poll.

Pressley's win comes less than three months after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ousted the No. 4-ranking House Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, in a primary.

In his concession speech, Capuano said the district was clearly upset with the status quo and that he shared those feelings.

"I will tell you, I'm sorry it didn't work out but this is life and this is OK. America is going to be OK," Capuano said, adding, "Ayanna Pressley is going to be a good congresswoman and Massachusetts will be well served."

Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley did not argue that Capuano was too moderate. In fact, she said, the two would vote the same way. Instead, the 44-year-old Pressley -- already a rising star in Democratic politics -- cast the race as about Democrats' need for a new, more assertive style in the Donald Trump era.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Justice Department plans to take dozens of cases away from an immigration judge who has delayed deportation orders, in part for perceived criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the union representing immigration judges said Wednesday.

CNN reported Tuesday that the Justice Department replaced Philadelphia Immigration Judge Steven Morley with an assistant chief immigration judge last month to hear a single case on his docket, which resulted in a young undocumented immigrant, Reynaldo Castro-Tum, being ordered deported.

Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jack Weil told Morley that comments in the Castro-Tum case were perceived as "criticism" of the Board of Immigration Appeals and attorney general's decisions and that they were "unprofessional," according to the grievance filed by the National Association of Immigration Judges. The cases all involve young undocumented immigrants and whether they got adequate notice from the government about hearings at which they failed to appear. Weil also told Morley that he himself should have either ordered Castro-Tum deported or terminated the case altogether.

It's the most public fight yet between the union that represents the nation's roughly 350 immigration judges and Sessions, who has intently focused on the immigration courts under his purview. The immigration judges have long bemoaned their structure under the Justice Department, but have taken particular issue with many of the moves pursued by the Trump administration that they say interfere with their ability to conduct fair and impartial court proceedings.

Unlike federal judges, immigration judges are employees of the Justice Department and the attorney general has the authority to hire them, manage their performance measures and even rule on cases with binding authority over how the judges must decide similar issues.

__label__politics (CNN) Former first lady Laura Bush spoke out Sunday night about the separation of families on the US border, writing a harsh criticism of the current zero-tolerance immigration policy being enforced under the Trump administration.

Bush, whose opinion piece ran in The Washington Post, decries the separation of children from parents entering the United States illegally as "cruel" and "immoral."

It's a rare public admonishment of current administration policy from Bush, who has seldom weighed in on politics since her husband left office.

"I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart," Bush writes.

"Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso," she continues. "These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The sudden retirement of a top US State Department diplomat dedicated to North Korea policy is raising concerns that the Trump administration lacks the experienced personnel needed to peacefully rein in Pyongyang's nuclear program.

Joseph Yun, who is in his early 60s, told CNN on Tuesday that it was "completely my decision to retire at this time" and that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accepted his resignation "with regret."

A source close to Yun said the decision to step away from his diplomatic post was the result of a combination of factors and was not intended as a protest statement.

Several sources familiar with Yun's decision told CNN he had planned to serve for only a year when the Trump administration took office and had already indicated a desire to retire for various personal and professional reasons.

But the source close to Yun added that he was certainly disappointed in what he viewed as a general lack of coherence on the administration's North Korea policy that made it difficult at times for him to discern the path forward.

The source described the administration's policy process as amateurish, but that was not the only reason for Yun's decision as he was a career diplomat familiar with messy policy making.

However, several State Department officials said they are disappointed by the timing of Yun's departure, given the urgent push to resolve tensions on the Korean Peninsula with diplomacy.

On Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert thanked Yun for his many years of service following his decision to retire, but said the notion he's the only person who can handle the North Korea portfolio is "wrong."

"The State Department has 75,000 people that work for us around the world," she said, "and people like Acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton and Chargé D'Affaires Marc Knapper are among those who can pick up the slack." The administration's policy on North Korea, she noted, hasn't changed.

The White House also declined to provide an estimate for when President Donald Trump might name an ambassador to South Korea -- only fueling uncertainty surrounding the administration's approach.

"I don't have a timeline and I don't have any personnel announcements on that position specifically," press secretary Sarah Sanders said.

The US has been without a permanent ambassador to Seoul since Trump assumed office with the position filled by the chargé d'affaires.

The vacancy of the key ambassadorship in Seoul, coupled with the loss of a veteran envoy in Yun, has revived concerns that the US lacks diplomatic experience while dealing with one of its most difficult foreign policy challenges.

"Today's announcement that Ambassador Joe Yun, our top North Korea diplomat, is resigning is yet another setback in the Trump Administration's chaotic and uneven approach to diplomacy in the Korean peninsula and to the overall institutional integrity of the State Department," said Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

"President Trump has made clear his fundamental misunderstanding of the role of diplomacy, and his disdain for the men and women of the State Department who have dedicated their lives to pursuing the foreign policy interests of the United States," he said in a statement.

Yun's retirement is also raising concerns about deepening divisions within different parts of the administration over how best to proceed on the issue despite hopes for diplomatic progress following the Olympics in South Korea.

"What we've seen in recent months is an unraveling of what was once a fairly coherent North Korea policy," according to CNN military analyst John Kirby, who added that internal issues have created a divide with the State Department and Pentagon on one side and the National Security Council on another.

"Some experts believe national security adviser H.R. McMaster has been running the National Security Council as its own competitive agency rather than serving in its traditional convening capacity -- and that has caused a rift with other branches of the administration and a disconnect in the overall strategy," Kirby said.

While Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have consistently said the US should exhaust all diplomatic options before considering the use of military force, the loss of key diplomatic voices like that of Yun could precipitate a more hawkish consensus within the White House, Kirby added.

And some worry that Yun's retirement puts the US at risk of being left out of the negotiating process.

"Now, with one less voice for forward-leaning diplomacy both inside the administration and in the region, the United States further risks being missing in action when it comes to advancing a safe and secure future on the Korean Peninsula for ourselves, our allies and for the broader region," Sen. Menendez said.
__label__politics "These are extraordinary times. Dangerous times," Obama warned in an extraordinary indictment of the behavior of a successor to whom he handed power in January 2017 and who has torn at the conventions that restrain presidents ever since.

It was a revealing moment in an enthralling clash of philosophy, temperament and style that unfolded Friday between a current and former president who epitomize opposing currents in an epochal political moment and are now in direct conflict ahead of the midterm elections.

The campaign trail face-off between Obama and Trump also capped a consequential week that saw the awakening of the Washington establishment after John McCain's funeral turned into an indictment of Trumpism and in which Trump battled an enemy within his own administration.

Obama, ditching his self-imposed political exile, warned of a moment of unique national peril, in which demagogic forces -- aka Trump -- are undermining the structures of democratic government to build their own omnipotence.

"They start undermining norms that ensure accountability and try to change the rules to entrench their own power," Obama said in a major speech in Illinois.

"It shouldn't be Democratic or Republican to say that we don't pressure the attorney general or FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents -- or to protect members of our own party from prosecution just because an election's coming up," he said.

At almost the same moment, aboard Air Force One, the current President told reporters he wanted Attorney General Jeff Sessions to hunt a senior official within his administration who sent the White House reeling with a devastating anonymous New York Times op-ed that branded him unfit for power.

"Here's criticism where you can't fight back. 'Cause you have somebody doing it anonymously," Trump said, after he effectively ordered the criminal investigative functions of the state to purge an opponent who has not committed a crime but has merely exercised a First Amendment right.

It was far from the first time Trump has appeared to shun conventions designed to shield the instruments of justice from political interference. He has spent months lambasting the FBI and the Justice Department over the Russia investigation. Earlier this week he complained that Sessions should not have allowed two Republicans to be indicted over corruption allegations.

Friday's competing appearances were the latest intense intersection of two giant, idiosyncratic political opposites who are again waging a struggle for the political soul of their nation.

Ever since Trump made the birtherism conspiracy his bridge to politics from the tabloid life of a tycoon and real estate star, he and Obama have been locked in a mutually antagonistic embrace , as opposites in decorum and ideology.

That mirror image was on show Friday.

Opposing styles

Obama, serene and intellectual, chose the conventional medium for a politician, a long, reasoned, multi-layered speech, to frame a political problem -- the conditions that led to the rise of Trump -- and to give Democrats a battle plan to restore America's ailing democracy.

He bemoaned missing checks and balances in Washington, the indifference of Republicans to Trump's power grabs, the predominance of bullies, and walls being put up around America, and he diagnosed a "backlash from people who are genuinely, if wrongly, fearful of change."

In signature style, he called on young people to vote, campaign and fight for their democracy, and argued that despite everything there is a unifying American "common ground."

At times, he appeared to be renewing his own faith in a brand of politics that shot him to power from nowhere in 2008 but whose effectiveness has been called into question -- even by some more radical Democrats -- as Trump crushes his legacy and the GOP monopolizes power.

Trump, the king of the barbed tweet, who reinvented the way to win the White House, brawled on social media, sparred with reporters and in a stream-of-consciousness campaign speech of his own displayed his more gritty, authoritarian and aggressive political methodology

He mocked Obama's approach. "I watched it, but I fell asleep. I've found he's very good for sleeping," Trump said in Fargo, North Dakota, before reeling off a list of his administration's achievements and slamming America's foreign trade partners.

"I don't want to be taken advantage of by other countries in the world," he said.

The thrust of Obama's argument was that America is a great nation that has slumped into crisis because its core values are being trampled. Trump's -- in line with his strongman's instincts -- was that he inherited a humbled and disrespected country and he had already redeemed it.

He told his crowd that a strapping man had come up to him at his event with tears rolling from his eyes and said: "I want to thank you, Mr. President, for saving our country."

Same aim

In essence, Trump and Obama were trying to do the same thing -- electrify grass-roots voters and drive turnout in midterm elections that both view as the most crucial for decades and that will be crucial to the fate of the Trump presidency.

Obama is a singular political figure. While he won two impressive general election victories, he found it more difficult to bestow his appeal to Democrats in midterm elections, when he was not on the ballot. It may be even more difficult to do so when he is out of power.

Trump is also unique, and it is not clear whether he will be any more successful in transferring his magnetic appeal with the grass roots to Republican candidates in midterm polls.

Obama found out how a presidency can be crippled by the loss of the House of Representatives. Unless Trump can buck history, he may experience an even more painful defeat, given the multiple political and legal storms already battering his White House.

Their combat on Friday opened up intriguing new possibilities for the fall campaign, and risks for both.

Obama had stayed out of the spotlight for the last 19 months for a reason, apart from honoring the tradition that presidents don't usually criticize their predecessors. He knows that he has now given Trump the political target he has often lacked during his presidency.

Obama, who is reviled by many Trump voters, could become an organizing catalyst for grass-roots Republicans as well as Democrats.

The more President @BarackObama speaks about the 'good ole years' of his presidency, the more likely President @realDonaldTrump is to get re-elected.



In fact, the best explanation of President Trump's victory are the "results" of the Obama Presidency! — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 7, 2018

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham spotted the opening for Republicans and for Trump in 2020, by tweeting: "The more President @BarackObama speaks about the 'good ole years' of his presidency, the more likely President @realDonaldTrump is to get re-elected."

On the other hand, many Democrats and others who remember Obama's presidency and conduct in the White House fondly have often wondered why he has not been more vocal in taking on Trump. There is still no Democrat with the capacity to frame a political problem, distill a message and deliver it as well as Obama.

Still, his re-emergence was not universally welcomed by serving Democratic lawmakers.

Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he was worried that the midterms could become fixated on personalities rather than the needs and concerns of voters.

"We have got a President who is really adept about making the day about him, day in and day out. My concern here is President Obama may be simply feeding that dynamic where it is all about President Trump," he said.

But one thing is clear: With Obama and Trump going at it, the fall campaign just got a lot more interesting.
__label__politics (CNN) The official spin around the news - - confirmed by President Donald Trump -- that White House counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his post this fall goes something like this: We always expected Don to serve through the first two years of the administration. This is a very stressful job, and Don always said he wouldn't and couldn't stay in the role for the entire first term.

Which is, in part, true. Being the lead attorney in any White House is stressful. Being the lead attorney in the Trump White House is roughly equivalent to my stress level when one of my kids is the first performer at a piano recital.

But, but, but. Context matters -- HUGELY -- here.

And the context is this: We learned 11 days ago that McGahn had sat for interviews with special counsel Robert Mueller's team for more than 30 hours in the course of the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election. We also learned that Trump himself was unaware that McGahn had spent so much time with Mueller's team, and that the White House more broadly was unaware of what exactly McGahn had told Mueller.

That news "unnerved" Trump, according to CNN reporting . This paragraph, from CNN's report on Trump's reaction to the McGahn news, is prescient and telling:

"The meetings only add complications to the already-fraught relationship between the President and the White House's top lawyer. And as nervous aides await a verdict in former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's trial and watch with trepidation the inauspicious public relations blitz carried by lead attorney Rudy Giuliani, uncertainty surrounding the President's handling of the Russia investigation abounds."

While trying to downplay the news, Trump made clear that it irked him. "The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type 'RAT,'" Trump tweeted . "But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn't have to. I have nothing to hide."

Step back even beyond this month -- and think about the role McGahn has played in this White House. According to The New York Times, Trump tried to force McGahn to fire Mueller as special counsel last summer but ultimately backed down when McGahn refused to carry out the order. Trump also ordered McGahn to tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself in the Russia investigation, according to the Times. (Sessions recused himself anyway.) And McGahn was the person that then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates sought out to inform him that Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was lying about the nature of his contact with Russian officials -- and likely misled Vice President Mike Pence on that matter. (Trump fired Flynn for lying to Pence.)

So. What we know is that a man intimately involved in several of the most high-profile moments in the first 18 months of the Trump White House (and who was a legal adviser to Trump's campaign) is now leaving -- news that broke less than two weeks after the President was caught by surprise by McGahn's level of cooperation with the special counsel.

Or, let's make it even simpler: The man who single-handedly kept Donald Trump from firing Mueller is now leaving the White House, 11 days after the extent of his cooperation with that same special counsel was made public.

There is no such thing as coincidences that big in American politics. Just doesn't happen. McGahn -- and Trump -- knew exactly the sort of signal the announcement that McGahn was leaving would create. The reaction of Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to the news sums up that sentiment nicely: "I hope it's not true McGahn is leaving White House Counsel," Grassley tweeted at Trump . "U can't let that happen."

(It's worth noting that Trump didn't announce the news on Twitter because he wanted to. He did so because Axios reported the news of McGahn's imminent departure early Wednesday morning.)

If McGahn's departure had nothing to do with the ongoing legal and political swirl created by the Mueller probe, he could have easily delayed his departure into the private sector for a few more months -- maybe lasting until after the Mueller report was released. He isn't. That's telling.

Make no mistake: None of this is "going according to plan" for the Trump administration. McGahn's departure takes an already difficult situation for this White House and this President and makes it that much tougher. No spin can change that basic fact.
__label__politics Story highlights In the past, O'Keefe and his Project Veritas Action have been criticized for strategically editing footage

The Democratic National Committee quickly distanced itself from the accusations

Washington (CNN) A Democratic operative whose organization was helping Hillary Clinton's campaign announced Tuesday that he would be "stepping back" from the campaign after an edited video suggested that he and other staffers hired people to attend Donald Trump's campaign rallies and incite violence.

Robert Creamer -- husband of Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky -- announced his resignation in a statement after conservative activist James O'Keefe released a video under his organization Project Veritas Action, which showed Creamer and other operatives purportedly discussing methods for inciting violence at rallies for the Republican nominee.

In the past, O'Keefe and his Project Veritas Action have been criticized for strategically editing footage to create false accusations about people or groups.

Creamer was helping the Democratic National Committee with Clinton's campaign while working for Democracy Partners, a progressive consulting group. He is also the head of a group called Mobilize, which contracted with the DNC.

"I am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hilary Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the upcoming election," Creamer said in a statement. "As a result I have indicated to the Democratic National Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the campaign."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's personal lawyer used funds from his own home equity line to make a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf, he told CNN.

"The funds were taken from my home equity line and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank," Michael Cohen said in a statement.

Cohen also confirmed that he used his Trump Organization email account to communicate details of a payment transfer to Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels, who allegedly had an affair with the President before his time in office.

Earlier Friday, Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, provided an email to CNN in which Cohen confirmed the transfer to Daniels' former attorney, Keith Davidson. In the email, both Cohen's personal email account and trumporg.com email account were used. The deposit was confirmed to Cohen by a First Republic Bank employee.

Cohen responded later Friday, saying that he regularly used his business email account for personal matters.
__label__world The last time she saw him, Sang Chol was four years old, and together with her husband and their daughter, they were headed south, fleeing the fighting during the early days of the Korean War.

In the mass of hundreds of thousands of others trying to escape, Lee and her daughter lost sight of her husband and Sang Chol.

They continued south, becoming part of the flood of refugees who crossed what became the Demilitarized Zone. Only later did she discover that her husband and son remained on the other side of the divide, in North Korea.

They are among the tens of thousands of Koreans whose families were separated by the war.

Lee is now one of a small number of people fortunate enough to be chosen for government-run family reunions.

On Monday, the first reunion in three years will take place, at North Korea's Mount Kumgang. The reunion is included in the historic accord that was signed by the leaders of the two Koreas in April. Around 57,000 people were eligible to take part. Of those, 0.16%, just 89 people, will make the journey.

Those left out face the agonizing prospect of never seeing their family members again. More than 75,000 people have already died without ever reuniting with their loved ones.

"When I came to the South, I realized that I won't see them again alive," Lee, now 92, said of her husband and son. "I thought to myself that the war needs to be over for us to meet. I gave up seeing them again."

Separation

Lee grew up in South Hamgyong province in what is now North Korea, where she got married and had two sons. The first died in infancy, but the second survived and she and her husband named him Sang Chol.

Lee was staying at her in-laws' home in Kapsan county when the war broke out on June 25, 1950, after months of rising tensions between the US-occupied South and Soviet-backed North Korea.

Their house was in remote countryside and little news ever reached their doors, but refugees running away from the fighting told Lee and her in-laws what had happened. "They were coming from deep in the mountains," she said. "They told us as they left that they were fleeing and that we should as well."

The family packed food and supplies onto an ox cart and headed south.

"We didn't get to go back to our house. We fled with just the clothes we wore for the trip. We kept walking and walking," she said. "Then we walked again. I needed to breastfeed my baby. But there were so many people on the road and in the houses by the road so there was no place to do it."

Seeking privacy, Lee crossed a small stream with her infant daughter, leaving her husband to look after the then four-year-old Sang Chol.

When she returned, the two had disappeared. Lee walked all day but couldn't find them, becoming more and more distressed but determined to keep searching.

"I continued on. I thought he must have gone all the way," she said. "I didn't stop to sleep or eat and kept going."

Eventually she came upon her brother-in-law, who told her they had been searching for her as well. Lee's husband had gone back to try and find her, but they had missed each other on the road in the crush of refugees.

She never saw her husband or son again.

Fleeing war

As Lee and her husband's family continued south, she clung onto hope that he and Sang Chol would catch up with them.

The fighting did instead. One night, as they were sheltering in an abandoned house, she was awoken by the sound of bullets.

"We were in a bad spot," she said. "We all lay down and stayed there."

Unable to sleep, she lay in the dark and listened to the battle, her eyes tightly shut. Eventually an announcement came that the fighting had stopped and civilians could board a train headed south.

The train was packed with refugees. Lee and her relatives threw their luggage onto the snow-topped roofs of the carriages and climbed on board themselves. They rode the train overnight to a port, where they were told to get on a ferry headed for Geoje Island.

In the chaos, Lee was separated from her in-laws again, and arrived in Geoje alone.

"I carried my baby," she said. "I found a wall and slept at the bottom of it hugging my baby."

A week passed before they reunited with some of her husband's family, who had also made it onto the ferry.

As new arrivals to Geoje, they were given a small amount of supplies as part of a South Korean government program to resettle refugees on the island, but were largely dependent on the limited generosity of the locals.

Lee spent many days longing for her husband and son, wondering what became of them and imagining the worst.

"After I woke up I would take my daughter out to the field and sit on a rock. That was my spot. And I would cry," Lee said. "I cried for a year."

As time wore on, Lee gave up on seeing her husband and son again. She remarried, to a man who had become separated from his wife and fled south with his daughters, who Lee raised as her own. Over time, she found she could remember little about Sang Chol, only that he was a good boy, who didn't complain.

Long wait

Sang Chol is now 72. After his father realized that they'd lost his mother on the chaotic road south, he took the boy back to their home village to find them. Few details are known about how Sang Chol's life unfolded in the reclusive country.

After 68 years, his mother Lee is about to find out.

Lee said she felt numb when she learned she had been selected to take part in Monday's family reunion.

"I couldn't process that at first. I couldn't believe that I was going to see my son," Lee said. "Will it be okay to hug my son who's over 70 years old?"

Lee Keum-seom prepares for medical checks and other bureaucratic procedures before she reunites with her son in North Korea.

For most of the families split by the Korean War, their relatives are little more than vague memories to which they are connected by history and blood. Nevertheless, the loss and pain of the separation persists, as does the desire for reunion.

Hahm Seong-chan will be among the 93 people who meet their relatives on Monday.

His brother was around six years old when they last saw each other. They grew up in vastly different countries, with Hahm even working in South Korea for the US military, which remains widely loathed in North Korea for the brutal bombing campaign carried out during the war.

"I often thought it would be so nice if I could see my brothers just once before I die," he said. "When I got a phone call from the Red Cross that I made it to the first group of 500 out of over 50,000 applicants, I didn't think I would make it to the final list."

The 86-year-old told CNN he doesn't expect to recognize his younger sibling, who he can remember little about beyond that he was quiet and nice, unlike another brother who always used to get into fights.

"Maybe we'll be able to recognize each other because we share the same blood," he added. "Even if he doesn't remember me he must remember my name, 'Hahm Seong-chan.' I get so nervous thinking about that moment."

Picture taken on January, 18, 1951 shows Korean refugees fleeing to the south, as they pass by frozen rice fields.

Ongoing trauma

For many other separated families, the phone call confirming a reunion is yet to come.

Jung Kea-hyun, now 85, has applied 21 times for a reunion with his brothers, whom he became separated from in the war.

"I'm pining to see them again. People see their family again and cry their eyes out," he told CNN. "I cried a lot too."

At 85, Jung Kea-hyun fears he will never see his brother, who lives in North Korea, before he dies.

While reports on reunions inevitably focus on the lucky few selected, Jung's situation is the reality for the vast majority of those who have applied.

"You need to experience it to know it. You can speak to me and hear the story, but have you ever been separated from your family? Imagine not seeing them for 65, 70 years," Jung said.

He struggled even to explain the hurt to his own wife, a native of Seoul who didn't experience the war in the same way: "If she was from the North too, I could talk to her about it. But it was pointless because she wouldn't know. She wouldn't know how I feel."

Every year, Koreans visit their hometowns to feast with relatives and pay respect to their ancestors as part of the Chuseok harvest festival. For Jung and many others, this happy occasion is an added heartbreak -- he can't visit the town of his birth, and his relatives on the other side of the DMZ may as well be a world away.

This year, as he has done for decades, Jung will get as close as he can, traveling to a shrine in Panmunjom, near the DMZ, where he will perform the traditional rituals.

"Being separated from your family is something unimaginable," he said. "What I want is not a one-off meeting. I want to know who is still surviving. Just to know if they are still alive. Or even just for the letters to travel back and forth."

Picture released on December 26, 1950 of the evacuation of UN Command forces, including thousands of soldiers, civilians, vehicles and tons of supplies to Pusan from Hungnam port, during the Korean War.

For many families on both sides of the border, time is running out.

More than 75,000 applicants have died since the Korean Red Cross and state broadcaster KBS first began working to reunite families in the 1980s.

A flurry of reunions took place in the 2000s, amid improved relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, but then a lull followed as tensions rose again.

The last round of family reunions was in 2015. Now old and frail, many families fear they'll never be included on the list to meet their relatives, and even if they are they'll be too weak to make the journey north.

"The numbers selected will be very small," said Park Kyung-seo, president of the South Korean Red Cross, which organizes the reunions.

"I share fully with the disappointment of those who are not selected so I am trying with the North Korean partners to try and find other solutions, huge numbers are waiting."

"Imagine 73 years without knowing whether their family members are still alive or passed away -- no news at all," Park said. "The agony and anger, that's an unthinkable human tragedy."

This is the reality of the ongoing division of the peninsula, a division that for all the political bluster and fear of North Korean missiles heading to the US, affects ordinary Koreans more than anyone else.

"Even after the war, division caused the horror of war to take root in our everyday lives," South Korean President Moon Jae-in said last week as the country marked the 73rd anniversary of the end of Japanese colonialism.

"It took away the lives of countless young people, incurring enormous economic costs and loss of capabilities."

In September, Moon will travel to Pyongyang, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have pledged to continue to work "toward the declaration of an end to the Korean War and the signing of a peace treaty."

The families separated by that war, on both sides of the border, will be watching closely.
__label__world (CNN) Australian scientists are searching for the remnants of a meteor which burned spectacularly across the sky in Perth Tuesday night.

The unusual phenomenon was caught on camera by multiple spectators, and described as a "fireball" on social media.

__label__politics Phoenix (CNN) Rep. Martha McSally will win the Republican Senate nomination in Arizona, CNN projects, fending off a challenge from two hard-line conservatives and providing ambitious moderates in the GOP ranks a playbook to thrive in the Donald Trump era.

McSally defeated former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in a race that was overshadowed in recent days by the death of Arizona's Sen. John McCain.

She'll face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in a marquee match-up for the seat, which became vacant when Arizona's other Republican senator and intra-party Trump critic, Jeff Flake, announced he would retire rather than likely lose a primary over his criticism of the President.

McSally -- who sharply criticized Trump when the "Access Hollywood" tape that captured him making lewd remarks about women was released in 2016 -- closely aligned herself with him on issues like immigration during her Senate primary run. Her win in the last competitive primary on 2018's Senate battleground map is a major relief for Republicans who have watched Sinema spend millions of dollars on TV ads branding herself as a centrist who would "end the partisan nonsense and protect Arizonans" on issues like health care while Republicans went through a grueling primary.

Trump didn't endorse in the race, but he gave McSally a shout-out at a recent event at Fort Drum in New York. He noted that she is "not only an Air Force veteran, but the first woman ever to fly a fighter jet in combat in US history."

"And I got to know her very well, and she is terrific: Congresswoman Martha McSally," Trump said.

In the race's final days, both Ward and Arpaio set off controversy related to their handling of McCain's illness and death. Ward suggested on Facebook that a statement released Friday announcing McCain was ending medical treatment for brain cancer was timed to damage her campaign. Then, on Monday, she tweeted -- in what she later denied was a reference to McCain's illness -- that "Political correctness is like a cancer!" Arpaio, meanwhile, complained that he offered McCain's family condolences only to find that Cindy McCain had blocked him on Twitter.

Progressive Gillum wins a stunner in Florida

Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum will win the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida, CNN projects, scoring a major victory for the party's progressive wing while taking another step toward becoming the state's first black chief executive.

Backed by Vermont's independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and a coalition of progressive groups, Gillum upset former Rep. Gwen Graham, who had led in the polls for most of the campaign. He led a field of five competitive candidates in which he was the only non-millionaire -- and only supporter of "Medicare for all" single-payer health care. Gillum is the first black candidate to win a major-party gubernatorial nomination in Florida.

His victory sets up Florida, the biggest swing state in presidential elections, as a major test of the political atmosphere this fall. Gillum will face Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Trump-endorsed Republican, in a race that pits two 39-year-olds, who in many ways mirror their parties' national moods, against each other.

DeSantis defeated Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner, CNN projects. His win was expected -- but Putnam had entered the race as the establishment favorite and raised more money than DeSantis. DeSantis' victory proved the power of Trump's endorsement in swaying GOP primary voters.

Gillum's victory, though, came as a stunner in a wide-open contest. Democrats in the race, including billionaire Jeff Greene and wealthy former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, spent more than $100 million for the chance to wrest back control of the governor's mansion, which has been in Republican hands for two decades. Gillum got a late boost when liberal megadonors Tom Steyer and George Soros led a group that donated $650,000 to his affiliated political action committee.

The governor's race is one of two major statewide contests in Florida in November's midterm elections.

In the other, CNN projects that Florida Gov. Rick Scott will win the Republican Senate primary to face incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for a seat Democrats must hold if they hope to have a shot at the Senate majority.

Arizona, Oklahoma choose gubernatorial nominees

In Arizona, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey is up for re-election and will face Arizona State University education professor David Garcia, who defeated state Sen. Steve Farley and Kelly Fryer, the CEO of the YWCA Southern Arizona, for the Democratic nomination in a traditionally red state that has shifted to the left in recent years: Hillary Clinton lost there by just 4 percentage points.

The primary comes days before Ducey faces a major decision: who to appoint to fill McCain's seat. He'll have to choose between a Trump-like Republican and someone in the McCain mold -- or could try to bridge the gap, potentially with a placeholder pick.

In Oklahoma, Democratic state Attorney General Drew Edmondson will face Republican Tulsa businessman Kevin Stitt, who CNN projects will defeat Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett for the seat being vacated by unpopular, term-limited Gov. Mary Fallin.

Arizona and Florida also each have several primaries for House seats that are expected to be competitive in November's midterm elections.

Trump dominant in Arizona Senate primary

The Arizona Senate GOP primary underscored how the Republican Party in Arizona has shifted from one where McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, reigned supreme to one where Trump is the dominant force.

All three GOP candidates cozied up to the President. McSally, in particular, dropped her 2016 campaign criticism of Trump and aligned herself closely with the President.

Arpaio was competing for the same group of die-hard conservative voters as Ward, meaning that his presence in the race has cut directly into her support and undercut conservatives' hopes of beating McSally.

National Republicans see the Arizona US Senate race as crucial to keeping their majority, and think McSally is the only candidate that gives them a chance to win the race. Until recent weeks, they'd been frustrated she had not put the primary away.

But McSally found her footing with an onslaught of TV ads late in the race.

She aired an ad featuring Trump calling her the "real deal." She withdrew her co-sponsorship of a bill that offered "Dreamers" a path to citizenship, and she mimicked Trump's attacks on "chain migration." She became a fixture on Fox News, where she aligned herself with Trump and heaped praise on the President.

And she cast Ward -- who'd launched her campaign as a strident critic of Flake and McCain, a Trump opponent, with the backing of then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon -- as a Trump critic.

"McSally did a masterful job capitalizing on Ward's 'phonyisms,' " said Robert Graham, a former Arizona Republican Party chairman who is a Trump ally. "The religious right freaked and abandoned her and the immigration people consider her soft."

An anti-Ward super PAC spent more than $4 million on at times misleading ads that cast her as weak on immigration enforcement and opposing Trump's calls for increased military spending.

McSally's campaign, meanwhile, aired an ad asserting that Ward "doesn't support President Trump" on immigration. It highlighted Ward's opposition to a Trump-backed bill that Ward labeled "amnesty."

Another key moment came in a late-July editorial board meeting at The Arizona Republic -- the only time McSally and Ward would debate, with Arpaio declining the invitation -- on the topic of abortion. Both said they want Roe v. Wade repealed, but Ward called for a "more incremental" approach, including a ban on abortions after 24 weeks, while McSally said she favors banning abortion in all cases except rape, incest and when the woman's life is in jeopardy.

Ward also said abortion is debated "in a fashion that was designed to raise money for people on both sides of the issue."

The comments alienated anti-abortion activists who were a key part of the conservative constituency a McSally challenger would have needed.

Then, late in the campaign, Ward courted controversy when she invited Mike Cernovich -- a far-right commentator who promoted the infamous "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory -- on her bus tour, and then told NBC News that "attaching those things to me is ridiculous."

Explaining her decision to invite Cernovich, Ward said: "We need to have a hook to get you guys interested in seeing the bus tour."

Ward apologized Monday for a Facebook comment a few days previously suggesting an announcement by McCain's family that he would end his cancer treatment was designed to hurt her campaign, saying her comment had been misinterpreted.

Arpaio, meanwhile, watched his campaign descend into chaos. The Federal Election Commission laid out a host of problems with his first-quarter campaign finance report in a letter to his campaign. And longtime consultant Chad Willems, who until recently was Arpaio's campaign manager, was receiving the vast majority of the $1.3 million raised for the campaign. Arpaio's campaign ended in a fizzle, while Ward attracted headlines as the anti-establishment candidate.

"McSally proved to voters for months that she has the ability to laser-focus in on Sinema's weaknesses in a way that highlights her own strengths, even while facing competitors in a primary," said Brian Anderson, an Arizona GOP strategist and former aide to Ducey.

"Kelli Ward continued to remind everyone," Anderson said, "that she's a ticking time bomb who can't talk her way through a question about Pizzagate -- let alone face an opponent like Sinema."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Sunday that if the President sits down for questioning by special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump will say he never discussed easing up on a probe of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn with former FBI Director James Comey.

"There was no conversation about Michael Flynn. The President didn't find out that Comey believed there was until about, I think, it was February when it supposedly took place. Memo came out in May. And in between, Comey testified under oath, in no way had he been obstructed at any time," Giuliani told CNN's "State of the Union" anchor Jake Tapper. "Then all of the sudden in May he says he felt obstructed. He felt pressured by that comment, 'you should go easy on Flynn.' So we maintain the President didn't say that."

Comey testified to senators in June of last year that Trump told him during an Oval Office meeting the previous February that he wished Comey would drop a probe into Flynn, saying he hoped Comey would "see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."

Comey also wrote in his book, "A Higher Loyalty," that he discussed the conversation about Flynn with senior FBI leadership and, while in the car after the Oval Office discussion, emailed his staff to say that the counterterrorism meeting went well, "but 'now I have to write another memo.'"

"What I meant was that I had another conversation with the president that I needed to document," he wrote. "I prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership, including Deputy Director (Andrew) McCabe; my chief of staff Jim Rybicki; and the FBI's general counsel Jim Baker."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A federal court concluded Tuesday there is 'insufficient time' before the November midterm elections to redraw an electoral map that the courts have ruled is unconstitutionally gerrymandered.

"Having carefully reviewed the parties' briefing and supporting materials, we conclude that there is insufficient time for this Court to approve a new districting plan and for the State to conduct an election using that plan prior to the seating of the new Congress in January 2019," the court ruling read.

"And we further find that imposing a new schedule for North Carolina's congressional elections would, at this late juncture, unduly interfere with the State's electoral machinery and likely confuse voters and depress turnout."

In late August, the same panel of federal judges ruled that North Carolina's congressional map favors Republicans and "constitutes an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment, and Article I of the Constitution."

Republicans hold 10 of the state's 13 seats in the US House of Representatives, and a redrawn map could potentially affect control of the House.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A panel of three federal judges in North Carolina ruled Monday the state's congressional map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that favors Republicans, and said it may require districts to be redrawn before the November elections.

Republicans hold 10 of the state's 13 seats in the House of Representatives, and a redrawn map could put more seats in play for Democrats -- potentially affecting control of the House.

The judges acknowledged primary elections have already occurred, but said they were reluctant to let voting take place in districts that courts twice found had been unconstitutionally drawn.

The same decision was reached by the court in January, but the Supreme Court declined in June to hear the case and it was sent back for reconsideration. The Supreme Court has never ruled a partisan gerrymander to be unconstitutional, and it passed up three separate opportunities to do so in the last term.

The decision Monday could result in an election-year appeal to the Supreme Court. The court is currently evenly split on ideological lines and lacks a ninth justice to tip the scale. The court also traditionally does not approve of judicial actions so close to an election that could affect the outcome.
__label__world Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Lawyers representing former South Korean president Park Geun-hye have accused authorities of committing "serious human rights violations" against the now-disgraced leader, who is awaiting trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power.

According to a document supplied exclusively to CNN by Park's international legal team, Park's lawyers allege the 65-year-old former leader is living in a cell that's dirty, cold and constantly lit so she cannot sleep.

The allegations are made in a draft of a "report on the human rights situation" concerning Park compiled by the MH Group, which is leading Park's international legal team.

It submitted the document to the United Nations Human Rights Council (OHCHR) Wednesday, less than a month before the council is due to conduct a routine review South Korea's record on human rights -- a review conducted for all UN member states.

Critics point out that the United Nations Human Rights Council does not have the ability to levy punishments against South Korea and any decision issued in Park's favor is unlikely to affect her current situation.

The South Korean Ministry of Justice refuted the MH Group's claims in a statement, saying Park is being detained in an "appropriately-sized room with a floor-heating system, TV, shelf and a flush toilet."

"We guarantee enough and appropriate medical care such as our medical staff in the prison providing medical treatment any time if needed," the Justice Ministry statement said.

It added that Park had twice received medical treatment from an external medical center.

"We provide a regular meal that's considerate of nutrition balance, and provide enough opportunity for outdoor exercises," the ministry said.

The statement also said that two of the three lights in the room are turned down at night, with the third left on "so that we can still watch her movements."

A spokeswoman for the Seoul Detention Center, the facility where Park is being held, told CNN the center denied all allegations, and did not believe Park had been treated inhumanely.

In a written response Thursday, the detention center said that Park's cell was about 10 square meters (108 square feet), and was equipped with a fan, locker, desk cleaning tools and toiletries.

"Park Geun-hye's cell is in a good clean condition," the detention center said in a fax to CNN. "Seoul Detention Center is following the regulations made by law in offering reasonable treatment in order to protect (the) inmate's human rights and to perform correction and reformation."

Allegations

According to the MH Group's draft document, Park is said to be suffering from a handful of chronic conditions and maladies including chronic lower back pain; osteoarthritis in her knee and shoulder joints; a rare disorder of the adrenal glands; and malnutrition.

"Her condition is only getting worse and there is no evidence that she is receiving adequate care," the draft said.

The draft submission mentioned reports that Park has been sleeping on the floor, but a detention spokeswoman said Park has a folding mattress, as beds are not considered essential in South Korean detention centers.

When asked for clarification, Rodney Dixon, a lawyer for the international legal team representing Park, said she is not sleeping on a proper bed, which is exacerbating chronic conditions she suffers from.

The Justice Ministry later said Park was given an extra folding mattress for her back pain.

Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, left, arrives for her trial at the Seoul Central District Court on Monday.

Park, the country's first female president, was ousted in March and later charged with abuse of power and accepting bribes. A court ruled to extend her detention another six months on Friday.

Her trial has yet to begin in earnest.

Speaking for the first time publicly in months, Park said in court Monday she is innocent and called the charges against her "political retaliation in the name of the rule of law."

"The past six months have been a terrible and miserable time," Park said.

"It is meaningless to believe that the court will handle the case only in accordance with the constitution and conscience despite political winds and public pressure," she said.

She added that her defense team in Seoul resigned in desperation.

South Korea's top prosecutor, Moon Moo-il, on Tuesday denied Park's allegation that she is the victim of political revenge, according to South Korea's Yonhap news.

Park's South Korean team is distinct from MH Group, a global consultancy that deals with high-profile international legal and diplomatic cases. They previously represented Saif Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan leader.

Downfall

Park is the daughter of former South Korean strongman Park Chung-hee, who seized power in a 1961 coup and was later killed by his own security chief in 1979 -- five year's after her mother's assassination. She joined politics in the 1990s after the Asian economic crisis and was elected president in 2012, defeating current President Moon Jae-in.

Her downfall, however, was swift. Park was impeached shortly after allegations surfaced that she revealed state secrets to a confidant, Choi Soon-sil, who has since been convicted in connection with the corruption scandal. Protesters took to the streets by the tens of thousands demanding her ouster.

She was impeached in December 2016 and a high court voted to uphold the decision in March, leading to her ouster and clearing the way for prosecutors to charge her (sitting South Korean presidents are immune from prosecution for anything but insurrection and treason.)

Tens of thousands gathered to both celebrate and decry the decision in the capital of Seoul.

The much older pro-Park crowd derided the decision as a political one. The noticeably younger protesters celebrating saw her ouster as a victory in the fight to crack down on corruption and perceived close ties between members of the country's political elite and the chaebols -- the massive conglomerates like Samsung and Lotte Group that dominate South Korea's economy.

Her successor, the liberal President Moon Jae-in was elected partly on the basis of his reputation as a "clean candidate" in the special election that followed Park's humiliating ouster.

MH Group President Mishana Hosseinioun is calling on the government to take action to ensure Park's rights are not violated.

"Authorities can still course-correct before their rights record at the UN is permanently tarnished, but my team and I are prepared to take this matter to the highest levels necessary to get justice," she said.
__label__world Seoul, South Korea (CNN) As many as 29 people have died due to heatstroke in South Korea, according to the South Korean Ministry of Health, Welfare and Disease Control.

The country is undergoing an extended heatwave, with at least 15 days of temperatures over 35˚C (95˚F) recorded, the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) reported. The agency added that Wednesday was the hottest day in Seoul in 111 years, with a temperature of 39.6˚C.

The Office of the Prime Minister has ordered all public construction sites to cease work during daytime hours for the duration of the extreme temperatures.

The government will also focus on medical support to communities, including providing fluid and cooling systems for 1,000 elderly farmers.

On the northern side of the Korean demilitarized zone, state media KCNA republished an editorial from state newspaper Rodong Sinmun on Thursday, which said "this year's high temperature(s are) an unprecedented natural disaster."

(CNN) Donald Trump isn't the only leader falling foul of his own hubris . His friend, Saudi Arabia's ambitious ruler-in-waiting Mohammed Bin Salman, is also finding that his rhetoric is catching up with him.

Allies have lionized MBS as a modernizer, breaking with the desert Kingdom's extremely conservative roots. Skeptics have been silenced by his far-reaching reforms, including allowing women to drive.

But in recent weeks his image has taken a tarnishing -- dulled by his own hand.

Reports indicate that the two trillion dollar IPO of the Saudi oil behemoth, Saudi Aramco, may be delayed or even canceled -- raising questions about how wise a financial idea it was initially.

It raises bigger questions, too: has he overreached and, more fundamentally, what sort of leader is he?

Until this moment he seemed just the sort of forward-looking ruler friends like Trump, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel could do business with, albeit against a background drumbeat of criticism from their electorates.

For any of MBS' perceived failings -- like the grinding war over his southern border in Yemen with its predictable dire toll of death and misery -- his stated desire to disengage and deliver a diversified, oil-free future for Saudis at home, Vision 2030, was a seductive narrative.

It kept a shine on international relations and greased the skids on massive controversial arms sales, some of which are killing Yemen's civilians.

So it seems strange with all that at stake, MBS is stepping out of what has become a carefully honed international image of well-intentioned reformer.

Everything started to go pear-shaped when Saudi Arabia found itself in a bust-up with Canada over slights about its Human Rights record.

In the space of a few hours, Saudi expelled Canada's ambassador to Riyadh, banned new business deals and recalled many Saudi students studying in Canada.

It smacked of Saudi's all-or-nothing approach to dealing with tiny Gulf state Qatar. A year into that dispute, MBS' allies -- the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt -- are still entrenched, refusing anything but a climbdown by Qatar's Emir.

On this, the world mostly looked the other way, presuming that given time, they'd dig their way out of their differences. Instead, MBS doubled down, pushing allies to pick a side.

And herein lies the danger of corrosion: like a drunken night out relived the next morning, every excruciating flaw in the thrill of the night before becomes magnified and impossible to ignore.

MBS' apparently Midas-like touch to sell an image -- against all probability, given Saudi Arabia's spotty reform record -- of being able to fix his Kingdom's woes risks losing its allure if his character flaws can't be overlooked.

Into sharp focus come reports this week that a young, female human rights activist arrested a few years ago will likely go to trial, where a guilty verdict could lead to the death penalty.

For MBS' allies, all his foibles and slips become accumulative. It's not hard to imagine cabinets bandying around the question of what is the political price at home for blindly following MBS' vision?

But if his recent retaliation against Canada has reopened questions about his youthful ambition, his temperament and his ability to deliver on his aims, then perhaps the latest revelation that funding for his grand reform plans may be under threat could really shake his hold on the Saudi narrative and the confidence of friends.

MBS rattled investor confidence last year, arresting several hundred senior royals and businessmen, accusing them of corruption. After being incarcerated in a luxury hotel, most were released early this year, albeit with lighter wallets.

A Saudi banker I met in Switzerland around that time told me few Saudis he knew were investing in their country.

Saudi officials are saying it was always their plan to time the Aramco IPO when it best suited their needs, a function of many factors including oil markets.

Former US President George W. Bush found out in 2005 that surges in patriotism only last so long.

His failure to grapple with Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in a timely and effective fashion opened the flood gates to criticism over his handling of the Iraq war and the emergence of what was to become ISIS.

That facts and sentiment about Iraq had been pent up, building a critical mass behind post-9/11 patriotic barriers. But once confidence in Bush's abilities had been questioned all bets were off.

He didn't fail and fall, but was damaged.

MBS could be on a similar threshold. Latitude for all the good he might do for Saudis could become hamstrung if the political price of keeping him as a friend looks too steep.
__label__politics Whether it's because of his own conspiratorial mindset, a desire to keep political loyalists engaged or a lack of interest in dry policy details, Trump frequently acts to address an idiosyncratic version of reality.

On immigration in particular, but also on gender issues or electoral reform, Trump has often waded in to tackle what he bills as a national emergency that few other people see.

Trump's announcement Thursday that he wants to send " anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000" National Guard troops to the southern border , following a week of rising fury on the issue of immigration, is a prime example of how his oft-challenged beliefs drive government policy.

Also on Thursday, he revived one of his most notorious and misleading claims , the idea that Hillary Clinton's win of the popular vote in 2016 was the result of massive fraud.

He claimed that many people in the Democratic bastion of California voted many times, portraying the state of the electoral system as a grave national crisis.

"They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory.' Millions and millions of people, and it's very hard because the state guards their records," the President said.

The problem is that there is no evidence to support his claims, and even a commission set up by the White House ended up failing to prove Trump's portrayal of events that would represent an existential crisis for American democracy if they were true.

The border 'crisis'

In no area has Trump been so willing to create his own version of reality as on immigration policy, a topic that more than any other electrified his base and propelled him to the White House.

The decision to deploy the National Guard came in a week when he consciously stoked the flames of crisis, apparently set off by a Fox News report Sunday, about a "caravan" of Central American refugees trekking across Mexico toward the US border. With midterm elections looming, he's been taking fire from conservative media disappointed with his failure to do more, let alone build his signature border wall.

The White House billed the National Guard move as a last-ditch step to stem a torrent of people and drugs across the border in the face of congressional inaction. But it actually comes after a period of historically low transgressions -- despite a rise in crossings in March -- a fact that the President previously celebrated.

But it's not clear that sending the National Guard to the border, as his predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush both did on occasion, is a proportionate response to the current situation.

After all, members of the caravan actually want to get swept up by border authorities because they plan to apply for asylum, so they are unlikely to try to evade capture. Anyway, they represent the hordes of aliens descending on US borders that might merit a military response.

Indeed, critics of the border wall project itself say it addresses a problem that does not exist, and it would not deal with one of the most pressing immigration issues: the number of people who enter the country legally and then overstay their visas.

Trump's missing landslide

Trump's claims on voter fraud seem to be the fruit of a conspiratorial mind.

It all started even before he took office, when Trump made clear he wasn't satisfied with simply winning the White House via the Electoral College -- he wanted to establish that Clinton hadn't won the popular vote. Although Trump beat Clinton by 306 to 232 electoral votes , the Democrat outpaced him in the popular vote by almost 2.9 million votes.

"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," Trump wrote in a tweet in November 2016 that caused shock, bafflement and even derision.

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016

In an apparent attempt to spare the President's blushes, the administration eventually set up a commission to probe voter fraud in the 2016 election, on which Vice President Mike Pence was a key member.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the commission was dissolved after failing to produce any evidence, though Trump blamed the move on the failure of several states to cooperate.

But as with the current row over immigration, Trump opponents saw not just an attempt to indulge the President's prejudices at work, but also an attempt by Republicans to make it harder for minorities -- a key Democratic constituency -- to vote.

"The mere mention of voter fraud is a dirty tactic to suppress voters and turn people off from participating in elections. This undermines the public trust in our election system," said Chris Carson, president of the League of Women Voters.

Travel ban

One of the first big battles over immigration last year erupted after Trump announced plans to bar visitors from a number of mainly Muslim nations in what he said was an effort to thwart Islamic terrorists from infiltrating US soil.

We need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people," Trump tweeted on June 5, 2017, months after the original iteration of the travel ban executive order was blocked in the courts.

One logical problem with the travel ban, modified after several court challenges, was that if it was meant to stop terrorism, it was directed against the wrong people.

Many national security experts believe that the biggest threat to US shores from foreign-born terrorists is represented by those who can get into the United States under the visa waiver program covering European and other nations.

Still, as a political device, new versions of the travel ban, which is still being challenged in various courts, allowed Trump to deliver on his campaign promises to get tough on terrorism, even if it was not the most appropriate way to combat the threat.

Transgender troops

In a classic in his long history of volcanic tweets, the President set off a huge controversy last July by announcing that he would bar all transgender individuals from serving in the nation's armed forces.

"Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail," Trump wrote.

Yet his move appeared to catch the military off guard, since there was no plan in place to put the commander-in-chief's order into action.

It also appeared to be another attempt by Trump to solve a crisis that many of those involved did not believe really existed.

On the issue of medical costs, for example, a Rand Corp. study released earlier this year debunked the idea that transgender troops represented a huge burden because of gender transition therapy.

Rand found that medical costs for transgender personnel would be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million a year -- less than a quarter of 1 percent of the value of all health care costs for people on active duty.

This week, the largest association of doctors in the US took aim at Trump's other claim: that transgender troops could harm the morale and effectiveness of US armed forces.

As with other fronts in Trump's war on nonexistent crises, there is also a political explanation.

In March, the administration formalized the President's decision barring people with a "history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria" from serving in the military except in limited circumstances.

The policy, popular with evangelical groups vital to the President's electoral coalition, happened to come out at a moment when Trump was under extreme political and legal pressure over lawsuits brought by women who claimed they had had affairs or had been sexually harassed by him.
__label__politics (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors have responded to the latest proposal from President Donald Trump's legal team regarding a possible interview with the President, sources familiar with the matter said Tuesday.

The discussions for a possible presidential interview are continuing. The focus of the letter was an emphasis on written questions for the President, according to one source. Another source said Mueller's letter stated the written responses would pertain to questions regarding potential conspiring between Trump associates and Russia. The response left unresolved the issue of an in-person interview and questions regarding Trump's time in office, the source added.

The response was received on Friday, three-and-a-half weeks after the President's lawyers submitted their last offer. Trump's team hasn't responded to the latest Mueller proposal.

The news of the Mueller team's response comes the same day as excerpts from political reporter Bob Woodward's latest book, "Fear: Trump in the White House," became public.

In the book, Woodward describes a mock interview Trump did with his legal team, in which they hoped to prove to the President that he shouldn't sit down with Mueller's team for an interview. Trump's lawyer at the time, John Dowd, viewed the interview as a disaster. According to Woodward, Trump seemed surprised by Dowd's reaction and asked, "You think I was struggling?"

(CNN) In a secretly recorded tape at a fund-raiser, California Republican Devin Nunes told the truth to a group of Republican donors. Not knowing he was being recorded, Rep. Nunes told the donors that the Republican majority in the House has been and remains the main firewall that has protected President Donald Trump from the fallout that could come from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of whether there were links between the Russians and his campaign and of whether the White House has attempted to obstruct the investigation.

More than the President's Twitter distractions and more than the conservative news media, it has been the Republicans in the House and Senate who have been vital to the survival of this presidency.

Speaking to the donors, Nunes said: "if Sessions won't unrecuse and Mueller won't clear the President, we're the only ones. Which is really the danger ... I mean we have to keep all those seats. We have to keep the majority. If we do not keep the majority, all of this goes away." Nunes' words made clear that the House's investigation has been a charade designed to protect Trump rather than to reveal the truth.

In brazen fashion, Nunes can also be heard talking about the crass political calculations taking place -- especially with regard to the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and whether to attempt impeaching Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed and oversees special counsel Robert Mueller. The recording was aired by MSNBC.

Impeaching Rosenstein, an idea most politicians have agreed is purely a way to shut down Mueller, turns out to be an active project. It is just on hold because of timing, since Nunes recognizes that getting rid of Rosenstein could interfere with the Senate's ability to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. If Republicans keep control of Congress, the move against Rosenstein -- and Mueller's investigation of Trump -- might be coming next.

(CNN) In Dublin's Phoenix Park, one of the largest city parks in Europe, final preparations are underway for the arrival of Pope Francis this Sunday.

The park is mostly flat, home to wild deer and the Dublin Zoo, the US ambassador's residence, the headquarters of the Irish police force, an Garda Síochána, and the home of the President, Áras an Uachtaráin.

But nothing dominates its surroundings like the immense white cross that was erected in 1979 when Pope John Paul II visited Ireland . Then, 1.25 million people -- at the time a third of the population of Ireland -- came to the Phoenix Park to witness him say Mass.

I live right next to Phoenix Park and on Thursday evening found myself venturing toward the papal cross. As it came into view, an even bigger structure surrounded it, a massive semicircle stage, a smaller one within that, a long walkway from the grass to the stage covered in red carpet, and in the center, slicing through the front of the stage, the 115-foot tall cross, as if to say: still here.

There will be nowhere near the same crowds as there were in 1979 greeting this Pope.
__label__politics (CNN) Former Sen. Bob Dole reflected on the late Sen. John McCain's service to the nation after he and other leaders paid tribute to the Arizona Republican in Washington on Saturday.

In an interview with CNN's Ana Cabrera, Dole called McCain "my friend and my hero."

"I was his leader for 10 years when he first came to the Senate, and then I left in '96, but we had a special relationship," the Kansas Republican said. "I think we were the only two Republicans with a pretty bad disability."

Dole, 95, a former Senate Majority leader, was referring to the devastating injuries that both men suffered in war -- McCain in Vietnam and Dole in World War II.

McCain was tortured and beaten in the infamous "Hanoi Hilton" prison in Vietnam, where the Navy pilot was held for more than five years after his jet was shot down in 1967. The injuries he sustained in the crash and his imprisonment left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head.

__label__world (CNN) North Korea has accused Japan of sabotaging peace efforts on the Korean peninsula "at any cost."

The ongoing animosity between Pyongyang and Tokyo threatens to mar progress as the region and the US attempt to sway North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions in exchange for economic relief and diplomatic acceptance.

The two nations are so far from rapprochement that barely a day passes without blistering condemnation of Japan in North Korea's state media, or a hasty scramble from Japan's leadership to preempt any action from Washington that might not be in its best interests.

In the latest vitriol directed at Tokyo, North Korean state media claimed late Monday that Japan was engaged in naval exercises with British forces to police the shipment of goods to North Korea "under the pretext of strengthening the capability of monitoring the waters surrounding Japan."

"These are acts to check the climate of peace being created on the Korean Peninsula at any cost and ratchet up tension in the region," said KCNA.

The bad blood between the two nations dates back at least to the Japanese annexation of the Korean peninsula in 1910, an event routinely referenced in North Korean state media.

On August 23, North Korea's permanent mission to the United Nations issued a statement drawing attention to the "108 years since the Japanese gangsters cooked up 'Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty.'"

JUST WATCHED Japan PM: Nuclear North Korea greatest threat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan PM: Nuclear North Korea greatest threat 00:53

Describing the treaty used to justify the annexation as an "illegal document for invasion," the statement argued that Japan has failed to atone for its wartime actions.

"Japan, overheated with militarist frenzy, has to keenly realize that it can never go to the future with their crime-woven past left pending," the statement went on.

"At a time when the new trend for peace created on the Korean peninsula has massive impact on the world political situation, and there witnesses a drastic change in the relations of dynamics in the region, only Japan is being treated like an outcast," it said.

Abe the outlier

That statement, while incendiary, will likely strike a nerve for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Indeed, as North Korea points out, much of the international community has turned from viewing Pyongyang as a malicious uncontrollable threat to a possible returnee to the world's stage. Japan has been the outlier, beseeching the world, and President Donald Trump, not to trust Kim Jong Un and his regime.

"Abe is really trying and hoping he's not going to be marginalized no matter what happens between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump," said Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Japan.

"There is a real danger at the end of the day that Abe's Japan will have to pay the price for whatever changes are implemented by North Korea, without having a say in the decision itself," he told CNN.

JUST WATCHED Trump: No one should underestimate US resolve Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: No one should underestimate US resolve 00:51

That danger explains Abe's shuttle diplomacy , his dozens of phone calls with President Trump and at least eight face-to-face meetings since Trump came into office.

Abe has met Trump at the White House, at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, at G7 summits around the world, as well as in Japan, all to press the American president to keep Japan's interests at the forefront of his negotiations with North Korea.

Along with the nuclear threat Pyongyang poses to the region and the US mainland, Japan remains on tense alert over North Korea's use of short-range ballistic missiles, which have landed near Japan in the past, and the possible drawdown of US troops in the Korean peninsula, leaving Japan exposed to another emboldened regional player: China.

Abductions and political cover

Abe has also been pressing Trump to remember the fate of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. A report in 2014 by the United Nations Human Rights Council concluded that hundreds of South Koreans, Japanese and other foreign nationals were kidnapped by North Korea after the end of the Korean War in 1953.

Even as Abe appears as the supplicant in the relationship with Trump, at home his position is strong and the media in lockstep with his use of North Korea as the perpetual bogeyman, deflecting his domestic political scandals

"The Japanese media is not very good at covering foreign affairs, Abe gets to have the stories he wants people to believe conveyed in the mass media," Nakano told CNN.

"Abe has waged his whole political life on making sure North Korea is kept as the enemy," said Caroline Norma, a senior research fellow at the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies at RMIT University in Melbourne.

"Since 2007, the Abe regime in its first iteration gained political power domestically and constructed the whole administration as an anti-North Korean administration," she told CNN.

Deep divisions

The vitriol between the two countries is real, says Joseph Siracusa, also at RMIT University. And while the Japanese may fight for the fate of some 17 Japanese citizens , he argues that the North Koreans' grievances against Japan run much deeper, in much greater numbers.

"The thing that drives the Koreans crazy is the issue of the comfort women, the North Koreans have made a number of public protests that Japan has failed to acknowledge," Siracusa told CNN. "That explains it not only geopolitically, but they violated the flower of their youth. I think I'd remember that for a long time."

It's not known exactly how many women served as so-called comfort women but the Japanese government disputes the previously reported number of 200,000 across Asia.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women found in a report that "comfort stations" that provided forced sexual slaves for Japanese military began as early as 1932, nearly 10 years before it became a more widely known and regular practice.

"The first military sexual slaves were Korean from the North Kyushu area of Japan, and were sent at the request of one of the commanding officers of the army," the UN wrote in its report. The Japanese, it wrote, "were able to procure more women for the increasing demands of the army by using violence and outright coercion."

Seoul and Tokyo signed a deal in 2015 that was intended to settle the matter between the two countries, but victims groups objected and the issue remains highly controversial, even as South Korea and Japan work together to prevent more militarization and belligerence from North Korea.

Japan has expressed "sincere apologies and remorse" for the way the women were treated, and opened a fund to provide compensation for former victims in South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan. No specific deal has been negotiated with North Korea.

"The two sides are so far apart that it's hard to see the Japanese government being willing to get into that issue," Koichi Nakano said. "The issue of the comfort women is the single biggest obstacle to a more cordial relationship even with South Korea."

Talks are canceled, again

But the emotional issue is one of many that can thwart any potential progress on the North Korean-Japanese diplomacy front.

"Abe knows something, that this rapprochement is going to fall apart at the seams," said Siracusa. "North Korea has no intention of losing its nuclear weapons."

Indeed, Trump has canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's upcoming trip to North Korea where he was scheduled to meet with North Korean officials about Pyongyang's agreement to work to dismantle its nuclear weapons.

"I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Trump tweeted over the weekend. "Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the future, most likely after our trading relationship with China is resolved. In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon!"

There is no word yet on whether Pompeo has rescheduled his trip.

"Abe knows this is never going to be solved the way that people think it's been solved," said Siracusa. "He's not buying Trump's story. He knows this is going to bounce back. He's just waiting for the day he'll be proved right."
__label__world Farahnaz Ispahani is a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a senior fellow for South and Southeast Asia at the Religious Freedom Institute. She is a former member of Pakistan's Parliament where she served on the foreign affairs and human rights committees. Her book, "Purifying The Land of the Pure: The History of Pakistan's Religious Minorities," published in 2017. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) On Saturday, Rome's Colosseum was lit in red in support of persecuted Christians, including Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws. At the Rome gathering, Pope Francis described Bibi, alongside a Nigerian woman who was captured by Boko Haram, as "martyrs."

Bibi, an illiterate berry picker, was convicted of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed. She was accused by her Muslim neighbors who objected to her drinking water from the same glass as them because she was Christian. Under Pakistan's blasphemy law, her alleged comment is punishable by death. In 2010, Bibi, at age 45, was sentenced to hang, but her case is still pending.

Pakistan's blasphemy laws date back to the military dictatorship of Gen. Muhammad Zia ul Haq. In 1980, making a derogatory remark against any Islamic personage was defined as a crime under Pakistan's Penal Code Section 295, punishable by three years in prison. In 1982, another clause was added that prescribed life imprisonment for "willful desecration of the Quran" and, in 1986, a separate clause was added to punish blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed with "death, or imprisonment for life."

Bibi's case illustrates how blasphemy laws are used to persecute the weakest of the weak among Pakistan's religious minorities. As a poor Christian from a low caste, Bibi was among the most vulnerable and susceptible to discrimination. And the legal system -- which, in theory, should be designed to protect the innocent -- failed her in every way

However, Bibi's case isn't the first case in which Pakistan's blasphemy laws have been used to punish minority groups. Since Zia ul Haq imposed the laws, their application has unleashed extremist religious frenzy.

Procedures for investigation and prosecution lend themselves to widespread abuse. Assertion by a Muslim witness that blasphemy was committed is sufficient for filing of charges and arrest of a suspect -- even without corroborating evidence. Furthermore, the testimony of non-Muslim witnesses in defense carries less weight, and, in most cases, the filing of charges is tantamount to punishment, because bail is denied.

Worse still, once blasphemy is alleged, mob violence or targeted killing becomes a possibility. According to researcher Mohammed Nafees, from 1990-2011, there were over 50 cases "wherein blasphemy suspects were either extrajudicially murdered or died in jail."

To quote a 2016 Amnesty International report, " As Good as Dead: The impact of blasphemy laws in Pakistan ," once an individual is accused of blasphemy, "they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence."

Lawyers who dare to represent someone accused of blasphemy have also been killed. In 2014, Rashid Rehman, a distinguished human rights lawyer brave enough to represent those most vulnerable to blasphemy charges -- women and children of religious minorities, people with mental disabilities, and the weak and impoverished -- was shot dead in his office by two unidentified gunmen.

Meanwhile, judges who have dared to acquit an alleged blasphemer or convict the killer of an alleged blasphemer have either had to flee the country or face death.

Nonetheless, until now, Western governments, which viewed Pakistan as a strategic ally in the war on terrorism, did little to protect Pakistan's religious minorities. However, that might now be changing -- albeit slowly.

The Pope's attention to Bibi's case parallels efforts by the European Union's Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief to secure her release by making it a condition for continued European market access for Pakistani products.

More specifically, Jan Figel, part of the special envoy, informed the Pakistani government that the future of Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, status to Pakistan, which allows Pakistan duty-free access to the EU markets, would be directly linked to the peaceful resolution of Asia Bibi's blasphemy case.

An EU news release further stated , "Pakistan's Supreme Court, appeasing certain political and fundamental forces of Pakistan, is intentionally delaying the hearing of Asia Bibi." If the European Union can hold firm in linking the renewal of Pakistan's GSP trading status to the outcome of her case, it would signal to Pakistani authorities that this is not a matter they can ignore.

But the European Union isn't the only body exerting pressure. The US State Department also has placed Pakistan on a watch list for "severe violations" of religious freedom on the recommendation of the United States Commission on International religious Freedom, after several waivers on grounds of the country's importance to US foreign policy.

The injustice of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, used frequently to persecute religious minorities, has been criticized by human rights advocates for decades. But it is only recently that the persecution of religious minorities has become a critical issue to the international community at large. Let's hope the European Union and the United States can hold their ground long enough to see Pakistan address the injustice of their laws.
__label__politics Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, admitted in court today that "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office" he acted to keep information that would have been harmful to the candidate and the campaign from becoming public during the 2016 election cycle.

Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts. The charges against Cohen include tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-candidate.

Though not named in the plea deal filed in court, the women whom Cohen helped silence were two who have since gone public with their claims of sexual encounters or affairs with Trump: porn star Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump has denied the claims.

Appearing in court on Tuesday, Cohen said of the charge linked to McDougal that it was done "for the principal purpose of influencing the election." Regarding the charge linked to Clifford, Cohen said the money "was later repaid to me by the candidate."

What has Trump said about all of this? Back in April, the President said he didn't know about the payment.

Here's that moment:
__label__world (CNN) Cambodian opposition party leader Kem Sokha has been released from prison on bail, almost a year after he was detained on charges of treason, according state news agency Agence Kampuchea Press Monday.

Sokha, head of the outlawed opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), had been held in solitary confinement since arrest in September last year, following a sweeping government crackdown on opposition groups and media.

Sokha is believed to suffer from a number of serious health problems, including high blood pressure, shoulder pain, and diabetes, according to rights groups who have campaigned on his behalf.

An August report by Human Rights Watch said Sokha's condition had deteriorated since his imprisonment and he now had difficulty standing for long periods of time.

"The Cambodian government obviously recognized the public relations disaster that would occur if something happened to him in detention, and finally heeded his wife's appeals to release him on his own recognizance for health reasons," said Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director, Human Rights Watch, Monday.

"But there are limits to his freedom, the bogus charges against him still stand, and he must appear in court whenever prosecutors snap their fingers," said Robertson.

"Despite the excitement connected to today's release, we're still a long way from a meaningful restoration of democracy and respect for human rights in Cambodia," he added.

Sokha, who was accused of conspiring with foreign powers to bring down the Cambodian government, was once viewed as a viable contender to replace the country's authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, who has been in power for more than 30 years.

The CNRP, the party Sokha once led, was dissolved by the county's Supreme Court in November last year. The CNRP had been the country's biggest opposition party and won three million votes, or around 44% of the total, during the previous general elections in 2013. They accused the ruling party of cheating and the country was rocked by massive protests.

The Supreme Court also banned more than 100 members of the CNRP from politics for five years, effectively paving the way for Hun Sen's governing Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to run unopposed in the national elections in July this year.

In statement, the White House labeled the July vote, in which the CPC won all 125 parliamentary seats, as "neither free nor fair" adding that it "failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A call about trade and migration between US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron soured last week after Macron candidly criticized Trump's policies, two sources familiar with the call told CNN.

"Just bad. It was terrible," one source told CNN. "Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that."

A short White House readout of the call with Macron said the conversation was focused on trade and immigration.

"Both leaders discussed the migration problem in Libya, and timelines to solve it. President Trump underscored the need to rebalance trade with Europe," the readout states.

Trump held a similar call with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday. It's not her style to be combative, but one source said May was expected to be direct in her criticisms and that Trump could expect a tough conversation.

__label__world (CNN) Leaders of the seven most powerful countries convened in the Sicilian town of Taormina for the G7 meetings. But on the sidelines of diplomatic talks, a new bromance seemed to have flourished between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, France's newly inaugurated president.

Trudeau and Macron met for the first time at the summit. On Friday, Trudeau wrote on Twitter he had a sit-down with Macron, where the two talked about "jobs, security and climate."

That same day, Trudeau and Macron stepped away to take a walk with the beautiful Italian scenery as backdrop.

Macron posted a video of the stroll with his Canadian counterpart, and wrote: "The Franco-Canadian friendship has a new face. @JustinTrudeau, we have to meet the challenges of our generation!"

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Sen. Jeff Flake hit back at President Donald Trump over what the Arizona Republican said is a misrepresentation of his support for GOP Rep. Martha McSally's Senate bid.

The President took to Twitter to offer his congratulations on McSally's projected Tuesday night primary victory -- and took a swipe at Flake, a vociferous Trump critic who is retiring from the Senate, in doing so.

"Martha McSally, running in the Arizona Primary for U.S. Senate, was endorsed by rejected Senator Jeff Flake....and turned it down - a first! Now Martha, a great U.S. Military fighter jet pilot and highly respected member of Congress, WINS BIG. Congratulations, and on to November!," Trump tweeted in the early hours of Wednesday.

CNN has reached out to the McSally campaign for comment. Flake disputed Trump's claim early Wednesday morning.

"Sorry, @realDonaldTrump. I made no endorsement in this race. I think the last endorsement I made was in the Alabama race," the Arizona Republican tweeted with a picture of the $100 check he gave to Democratic Sen. Doug Jones' special election campaign in December 2017. Jones upset the Trump-backed Roy Moore in that race, a Republican who was accused of sexual abuse.

Sorry, @realDonaldTrump. I made no endorsement in this race. I think the last endorsement I made was in the Alabama race.https://t.co/yob5VVNAOe pic.twitter.com/KbzKAGRdDB — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) August 29, 2018

Flake, who announced in October 2017 he would not seek re-election, did not formally endorse any of the candidates running to be his successor.

"Nobody would be asking for it in the Republican primary, I can tell you that. It -- this is very much, and you know I'm not happy about it, but this is the President's party right now," Flake said on NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday, alluding to his notoriously contentious relationship with Trump.

However, Flake did offer words of support for McSally on Tuesday.

"I think McSally will win. I hope she does. That's the only shot that obviously Republicans have to hold on to the seat," he told reporters on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning.

McSally defeated two hardline conservative candidates: former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Tuesday's primary election. She will face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in November.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Shortly before Sen. John McCain entered the Senate chamber in the wee hours of Friday morning, reporters wanted to know how he'd vote.

He instructed them to "watch the show."

McCain killed his party's narrowly-crafted Obamacare repeal bill Friday not because he was opposed to dismantling the Affordable Care Act, but because he fundamentally believed the process -- the lack of hearings, the one-party, closed-door negotiations, the fact that in the end all that Republican senators could agree upon was a shell of the plan they'd promised -- was flawed.

It was a result that may have been hinted at earlier in the week.

Less than two weeks after surgery to remove a blood clot revealed McCain had brain cancer, the Arizona Republican -- still with a visible scar above his eye -- traveled 2,000 miles from Phoenix and returned to a hero's welcome Tuesday in the Senate, where he delivered an epic 15-minute speech that rattled the conscience of the body.

"We're getting nothing done, my friends," McCain told his colleagues. "We're getting nothing done."

It was a fiery and intense lecture on the shortcomings of bypassing "regular order" and turning your back on compromise. But moments earlier, McCain had delivered a decisive vote to advance a health care bill that was still an uncertain product at that point, a kind of blessing for the type of secretive negotiations he'd just decried.

McCain's office announced Friday that he is planning to return to Arizona to start cancer treatment Monday. His office said he plans to return to Washington at conclusion of the August recess.

Friday morning, just before 2 a.m. ET, he delivered the fateful vote in the other direction. For over an hour, leadership tried to change his mind on the Senate floor on the "skinny repeal" bill. His junior colleague Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake appeared to be dispatched to talk him out of it. And when that didn't work, Vice President Mike Pence swooped in. Even President Donald Trump called to try a final "Hail Mary" to sway McCain, a source briefed on the call told CNN.

At one point, McCain was sitting with his long-time ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The two were deep in conversation as Graham nodded along. At one point Graham took a call, and the man who just days before had received an outpouring of support from his colleagues on the floor was all alone, with no Republican approaching the veteran senator.

McCain has defied his party before. The former prisoner of war stood with Democrats to release a report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques during the Bush years. He reached across the aisle to fix the country's health care system for veterans with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, and was known to unload on his own party when he felt they needed a reality check.

But Friday's vote may be one of his most memorable moments. In the end, the senator voted against a bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual and employer mandates, despised by Republicans, and against his party's seven-year campaign promise to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Instead, McCain took a vote that very well may re-chart the course of Trump's own legislative agenda.

Trump, of course, had insulted McCain back in 2015. "He is a war hero because he was captured," Trump said in a question-and-answer session in Iowa. "I like people that weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you. He is a war hero because he was captured. OK, you can have -- I believe perhaps he is a war hero."

Earlier this week, after McCain's vote advancing the health care bill, Trump was far kinder.

"So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John," Trump tweeted

McCain promised a show on the way in, and delivered. Reporters and observers in the gallery watched his every movement as he spoke to various senators. At one point, he even huddled with Democrats. As he was speaking to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, other Democrats came closer and closer, forming a large half-circle around the former Republican presidential nominee, who, make no mistake, has worked to thwart Democratic ambitions over the years as well.

"John McCain is a hero and has courage and does the right thing," Schumer said afterwards.

Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, had a feeling even earlier in the day that McCain may be on his side this time.

"We had a brief conversation that was intriguing and then several other senators also had other conversations with him. He was sort of leaving little hints, here and there," Coons said.

After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Leader Mitch McConnell lamented the end result -- McCain joining Republican holdouts Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in ending the Obamacare repeal dream for the moment.

"I regret that we're here," McConnell said. "I'm proud of the vote I cast tonight. It's consistent with what we told the American people we'd try to accomplish in four straight election if they gave us a chance."

As McConnell lectured his GOP colleagues for failing to uphold their promises to voters to end Obamacare, McCain sat nearby, hands folded in his lap, with Murkowski by his side, as she had been for most of the night.

Later, as he got into his car to leave the Capitol, McCain was asked, "Why did you vote no?"

He answered simply: "Because it was the right vote."
__label__politics Given several opportunities, President Donald Trump ignored questions about the passing of Sen. John McCain and the legacy he left behind.
__label__politics (CNN) Donald Trump has been president for 577 days as of today. One year and seven months, to the day, of what can be described without exaggeration as the least predictable presidency in modern history. And yet, for all the wackiness and whip-sawing of these first 19 months, there's a very credible case to make that the next two-ish weeks are the most critical of Trump's presidency to date -- and will set a course for the remaining years of his presidency that will be very difficult to alter.

Consider:

1) The jury in former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's trial on a series of alleged financial crimes entered its third day of deliberation on Monday. While the case focuses on Manafort's interactions with the Ukrainian government prior to his time at the head of Trump's campaign in 2016, it grew out of the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election being led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller. A Manafort conviction would provide momentum for the special counsel's office in advance of the release of Mueller's report on his investigation. (Much more on that below.) If Manafort gets off -- and, to be clear, he will still have to be tried in Washington, DC, on similar charges -- it will give Trump's "witch hunt" attacks more fuel. "See, I told you all along this was a hoax," Trump will tweet -- again and again.

3) We appear to be in the final stages of protracted negotiations between Trump's legal team and the special counsel's office about whether Trump will sit down with Mueller and answer questions. On "Meet the Press" on Sunday, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that Mueller's investigators "have taken 2-3 weeks to get back to us, so what I have to tell you is, look, I am not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury." The special counsel's office has been tight-lipped about, well, everything -- including whether or not Trump might sit down with Mueller's team. But given Giuliani's repeated assertions that the two sides are entering the latter stages of the negotiating process, it's hard to believe we won't have a decision in the relatively near future.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Sunday that the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior Trump campaign officials and Russians "was originally for the purpose of getting information about (Hillary) Clinton," but denied any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.

The description of the meeting, which was held between the President's son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, among others, starkly contrasts initial explanations that the meeting was about a Russian adoption policy.

"Well, because the meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about, about Clinton," Giuliani said on NBC's "Meet the Press," later adding, "That was the original intention of the meeting. It turned out to be a meeting about another subject and it was not pursued at all. And, of course, any meeting with regards to getting information on your opponent is something any candidate's staff would take. If someone said, 'I have information about your opponent,' you would take that meeting."

In the interview, Giuliani sought to excuse the meeting because of the outcome, as the President has looked to do, although critics have alleged that the intention of the meeting -- to get dirt on Clinton from the Russian government in an effort to harm her candidacy for president -- could provide evidence of collusion with Russia to affect the 2016 election outcome.

Giuliani's words mirror the President's insistence that the Trump Tower meeting was held "to get information on an opponent" and was "totally legal," but ultimately "went nowhere."

Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!

Giuliani suggested the Trump campaign officials in attendance at the Trump Tower meeting might not have known that the meeting was with Russians or that the lawyer in attendance, Veselnitskaya, was a Russian with ties to the Kremlin.

"I don't even know if they knew (Veselnitskaya) was Russian at the time. All they had was her name. ... They knew it when they met with her, not when they set up the meeting," Giuliani said. "All they knew was that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed she's not a representative of the Russian government."

However, in an email to Trump Jr., British music publicist Rob Goldstone, attempting to facilitate the meeting , wrote that "the Crown prosecutor of Russia met with Aras" Agalarov, a Moscow-based billionaire developer who partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013, "this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."

"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump -- helped along by Aras and Emin," Goldstone continued, mentioning Aras' son, Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, who he said had relayed the information.

Trump Jr. acknowledged the email, writing back in part, "If it's what you say I love it."

Kushner has denied improper actions, including collusion, during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign.

In July 2017 following his meeting with Senate Intelligence Committee staff, he said "I did not collude with Russia," adding, "I do not know of anyone else" on the campaign who did so.

On "Meet the Press," Giuliani also discussed White House counsel Don McGahn's extensive cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice. Giuliani indicated to the show's anchor, Chuck Todd, that he did not personally know what McGahn told Mueller's team, but rather, that the team had a "pretty good sense" of what McGahn said through former Trump lawyer John Dowd.

"We have a good sense, obviously, of what Mr. McGahn testified to, I can figure it out from ..." Giulani said.

"Wait," Todd interjected. "How do you say that, 'good sense'? Have you debriefed him?"

"No, no, but Mr. Dowd has a good sense of it, he talked to them at the time," Giuliani replied, later adding, "I think that through, through John Dowd, we have a pretty good sense of it."

"John Dowd yesterday said -- I'll use his words rather than mine -- that McGahn was a strong witness for the President, so I don't need to know much more about that," Giuliani said.

The New York Times reported Saturday that McGahn has cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, participating in several interviews spanning 30 hours over the last nine months.

The Times reported that McGahn's decision to cooperate was partly due to the fact that the President's initial legal team had decided to fully cooperate with Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, believing their client had nothing to hide and they could bring a quick end to the probe. But McGahn became concerned that the President planned to set him up to be held responsible for any potential illegal incidents of obstruction, the Times reported, citing to people close to him. So the White House counsel and his attorney came up with a strategy to cooperate as extensively as possible with the special counsel in order to prove that there was no wrongdoing by McGahn, the newspaper reported.

Trump blasted the Times' story in several tweets Sunday, saying he allowed McGahn and "all others to testify - I didn't have to. I have nothing to hide. ..."

The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type "RAT." But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn't have to. I have nothing to hide...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2018

....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller & his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2018

The Times said in a response on Twitter that it stood by the reporting.

McGahn's personal attorney, William Burck, said in a statement Saturday, "President Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn's testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team's questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) US officials met secretly with Venezuelan military officers who were plotting a coup against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, both a current and a former US official confirmed to CNN.

American officials met with the renegade Venezuelan military officers several times over the last year after the Venezuelan officers made contact, but Washington ultimately decided against supporting the coup, the two sources said.

The US did not provide the Venezuelan officers with any support and the plans for the coup ultimately fell apart, the sources said.

The Trump administration's discussions with the Venezuelan military officers about a potential coup were first reported Saturday morning by the New York Times . The current and former US officials confirmed to CNN that report is accurate.

The White House declined to comment on the meetings between US officials and Venezuelan military officers, but said in a statement the US continues to support "a peaceful orderly return to democracy in Venezuela."

"U.S. policy preference for a peaceful, orderly return to democracy in Venezuela remains unchanged. The United States government hears daily the concerns of Venezuelans from all walks of life -- be they members of the ruling party, the security services, elements of civil society or from among the millions of citizens forced by the regime to flee abroad. They share one goal: the rebuilding of democracy in their homeland," said National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis. "A lasting solution to Venezuela's worsening crisis can only arise following restoration of governance by democratic practices, the rule of law, and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms."

CNN also reached out to the press office of Venezuela's Ministry of Defense, who said they will not comment until they are given instructions to do so.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza responded to the news through his verified Twitter account, saying the Maduro government denounces efforts to intervene in the Latin American nation.

"We denounce before the world the intervention plans and the support to military conspiracies by the US government against Venezuela. In the US's own media came to light new and crass evidence," Arreaza tweeted.

President Donald Trump has previously discussed the possibility of a military option in Venezuela.

"We have many options for Venezuela. And by the way, I am not going to rule out a military option," Trump said last August.

Asked about the possibility of a military intervention in response to the mounting crisis in the country, the President said that is something the US "certainly could pursue."

Taking military action against Venezuela would be a dramatic escalation of the US's so-far solely diplomatic and sanctions-focused response to the political and economic crisis roiling the South American country.

In August 2017, Trump asked several advisers about the possibility of invading Venezuela, CNN reported in July.

Details about the meetings

The Times' report included details from the secret meetings, citing 11 current and former US officials and a former Venezuelan military commander sanctioned by the US government who was involved in the secret meetings.

The Venezuelan military commander is one of many on the US government's list of sanctioned Venezuelan officials accused of serious crimes, according to the Times.

The former commander told the Times at least three factions within the Venezuelan military were plotting against the Maduro government.

The Times reported that one such rebel group made initial contact with the US government through an American embassy in a European city's capital.

White House officials back in Washington were at first worried that the meeting request was a setup in order to record a US official appearing to conspire against Maduro's government, the Times reported.

But US officials finally felt the meetings were worth the risk as they watched the crisis in the Latin American country worsen, the Times reported.

Trump's administration sent a career diplomat with instructions to attend the meetings "purely on listening mode" and not to negotiate, a senior administration official told the Times.

From their first meeting held abroad in fall 2017, the diplomat made the assessment that the Venezuelan rebels did not appear to have a detailed plan, but instead were hoping the American government would provide guidance or ideas, the Times reported.

The former Venezuelan commander told the Times that the officers never sought US military intervention: "I never agreed, nor did they propose, to do a joint operation," he told the newspaper.

During a second meeting last year, the officers requested encrypted radios for secure communication, the Times reported.

But senior officials declined the request, according to the newspaper.

A third meeting was arranged early this year, however discussions resulted in zero promises of material support or clear signs that Washington supported the rebels' plans, the Times reported.

Attempts to stage a coup by Venezuelan rebels

According to the Venezuelan commander, the rebels attempted several times to stage a coup.

They were considering striking last July, when the election was held to replace the National Assembly with a new pro-Maduro legislative body called the National Constituent Assembly, the Times reported.

The plans to stage a coup moved to March, then later the May 20 election. However, both attempts were thwarted after the plans leaked, according to the Times.

The Times reported that it's unclear the amount of detail the Venezuelans shared with the Americans, yet there is indication that Maduro was aware of the secret meetings.

Once the richest country in Latin America, Venezuela has plummeted into an economic and humanitarian crisis where its people are living with food shortages, overcrowded hospitals, inflation and political turmoil. The chaos and ongoing crisis have triggered a mass exodus of Venezuelans seeking refuge in neighboring countries, ratcheting up tensions in the region.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump lashed out Saturday morning at his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and mischaracterized the government's April raid of Cohen's home and business, one day after reports that Cohen recorded a conversation with Trump about a former Playboy model who says Trump had an affair with her.

"Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of," Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday morning. "Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!"

Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 21, 2018

The recording about the former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, which occurred prior to the election, was among the troves of documents and materials that the FBI seized from Cohen's office, home and hotel in New York back in April amid a criminal investigation of Cohen by the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. Although Trump charged in his tweet that the FBI broke into Cohen's office, the agency was executing court-approved warrants in conducting the searches.

Despite the President's comment Saturday, he has waived privilege on the recording, said two sources briefed on legal discussions surrounding the materials seized in April. The recording had been deemed privileged by a former federal judge, known as a special master, one of the sources said, adding that Trump's lawyers asked the special master to withdraw the privilege. This gives the government access to the recording as part of the US attorney for the Southern District of New York investigation into Cohen.

Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN that Trump had no idea he was being recorded during his conversation with Cohen, which took place in the then-candidate's office at Trump Tower in September 2016.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's military parade in DC is likely to cost nearly as much as the now canceled military exercise with South Korea that Trump called "tremendously expensive" and said cost "a fortune," three US defense officials tell CNN.

The parade, which is now scheduled to take place on November 10, is currently estimated to cost approximately $12 million, the officials said. One official called the number "a planning figure," saying cost estimates could still change as planning develops.

"We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!" Trump tweeted in June following his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.

North Korea had long sought an end to the exercises, which it says are provocative. US military leaders have said the exercises are necessary to maintain the readiness of US troops in South Korea.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Rob Manning told reporters earlier this month that the now-cancelled US-South Korea Freedom Guardian Exercise was estimated to cost approximately $14 million.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A fifth-generation coal miner from Virginia has spoken out against President Donald Trump's rhetoric surrounding the coal mining industry, saying the President is making "false promises that are only going to line the pockets of coal executives."

In a New York Times op-ed video published Tuesday, Nick Mullins, a ninth-generation Appalachian from Virginia, said that if Trump wants to help the Appalachian mining communities that support him, "lowering emission standards is not the way to do it."

At this year's State of the Union address, Trump talked about ending "the war on beautiful, clean coal." Mullins says "coal cannot be clean," and that miners know firsthand.

"We have to realize that the environmental impacts of the industry aren't a partisan issue," he said. "They're a matter of life or death."

On Tuesday, the newly proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule was announced , which would allow states to set their own emission standards for coal-fueled power plants.

__label__politics (CNN) Standing near the spot where her son was gunned down, Michael Brown's mother, Lezley McSpadden, announced she is running for city council in Ferguson, Missouri.

"Almost four years ago to this day, I ran down this very street, and my son was covered in a sheet. It broke me, you know. It brought me down to my knees and made me feel crippled, as if I could do nothing else anymore," McSpadden said Friday during a news conference.

"I learned to walk again," she said, "and this is one of my first steps."

Brown, then 18 and unarmed, was gunned down in 2014 by a white police officer while walking home from a convenience store. His death sparked nationwide protests, helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement and, now, has fueled his mother's political ambition.

If elected, McSpadden would focus on community policing, economic equality and access to health care for all of Ferguson's young children, she said. She'd also work to rebuild the relationship between the police and residents of the St. Louis-area city of about 20,000 people, nearly two-thirds of them African-American

__label__politics White House counsel Donald McGahn has voluntarily participated in multiple interviews during the last nine months with investigators from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, the New York Times reported.
__label__politics Just before 5 p.m. ET, jurors sent a note to Judge T.S. Ellis with four questions, including one asking him if he could "redefine" for them the meaning of "reasonable doubt," the legal threshold for acquitting a defendant. Ellis responded that the prosecutors had to prove their case not "beyond possible doubt," but beyond "doubt based on reason."

Jurors also asked questions related to Manafort's tax filing and foreign bank account disclosure charges, including when a person is required to file a foreign banking disclosure, and the definition of "shelf" companies. Ellis instructed them to rely on their "collective recollection" and gave no additional explanation.

Jurors began deliberations Thursday morning. Manafort is facing 18 counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and hiding foreign bank accounts brought by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The jury will return at 9:30 a.m. Friday.

For the first time, the jurors are seeing pictures of the $15,000 ostrich jacket, $18,000 python jacket, and other high-end clothes Manafort purchased using foreign wire transfers. They are also debating the testimony of Rick Gates, Manafort's former deputy who admitted to embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars. And they can pore over reams of emails, tax forms and financial documents that prosecutors say are the "star witness" in their case.

The courtroom drama will be nothing compared to the political earthquake the verdict will bring, regardless of which way it comes down.

The President has repeatedly called Mueller's investigation a "witch hunt" that hasn't found evidence of Russian collusion with his campaign, and Trump's allies in and out of the White House say the special counsel should wrap things up.

"If he doesn't get it done in the next two or three weeks we will just unload on him like a ton of bricks," Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Bloomberg News

"Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and "Public Enemy Number One," or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?" Trump tweeted earlier this month about Manafort.

Where is the Russian Collusion? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018

An acquittal would only add to criticism that Mueller's investigation hasn't been worth the time and expense.

A conviction, meanwhile, would allow Democrats and Mueller's supporters to say ending the investigation would be premature given the special counsel's results, having previously collected several guilty pleas.

It could also boost Mueller's position as he negotiates with Trump's lawyers over a potential interview.

'This is a case about lies'

The trial has not touched on Russia or the 2016 election. Instead, the focus has been entirely on Manafort's finances.

Prosecutors say that Manafort collected $65 million in his foreign accounts from 2010-2014 and spent more than $15 million on luxury purchases in the same time period, including high-end clothing, real estate purchases, landscaping and other big-ticket items.

They also alleged that Manafort lied to banks to take out more than $20 million in loans after his Ukrainian political work dried up in 2015 and accused him of hiding foreign bank accounts from federal authorities. Manafort also was charged with receiving loans from the Federal Savings Bank after one of its executives sought a position in the Trump campaign and the administration, according to prosecutors.

"Mr. Manafort lied to keep more money when he had it, and he lied to get more money when he didn't," prosecutor Greg Andres said told jurors during closing arguments. "This is a case about lies."

Defense attorney Richard Westling said Manafort became the special counsel's victim in a "selective process of pulling" his financial records to concoct a narrative of an "elaborate fraud scheme." (Ellis, who has been a colorful, and at-times controversial, presence during the trial, later instructed the jury not to consider such characterizations of Mueller's team's motives.)

Manafort defense attorney Kevin Downing told reporters that his client was "very happy" with how closing arguments went. "His defense team got to address the jury, point out the shortcomings in the government's case and explain that the government has not met their burden of proof," Downing said.

Manafort faces up to 305 years in prison if convicted on all charges.

Why the questions?

Two of the questions from the jury Thursday were related to tax and banking disclosures from memorable moments in witness testimony during the trial.

Previously, Gates testified that shelf companies -- the type of company Manafort allegedly used to set up bank accounts in Cyprus -- were those that had been already set up on Cyprus' corporate registry so a person would not have to create and name a new company. It's as if they "are already on the shelf," Gates said.

The foreign banking disclosure question from the jury goes to one of the defense team's most effective examinations of a witness in the trial.

In that witness testimony, an agent from the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said multiple people could be required to file foreign banking disclosures on an account. But she also said that if a corporation owned a foreign banking account, it could have its own filing requirement and people who owned less than 51 percent of the company may not have to file.

Manafort and his wife, Kathleen, each owned 50 percent of his Ukrainian political consulting business, DMP International, which held some of the bank accounts. DMP International itself was not indicted -- though as a company it could have been, Ellis had told the jury previously.
__label__politics (CNN) The ranking Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee questioned if the Supreme Court would force President Donald Trump to comply with a potential subpoena for an interview from special counsel Robert Mueller amid continued uncertainty about whether the President will voluntarily sit for an interview with Mueller's team.

Rep. Adam Smith said in an interview Monday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer that if Trump does not agree to an interview, he's not sure the Supreme Court would force him to comply with a Mueller subpoena because he feels the conservative majority will side with Trump.

"Legally, it's clear: You can't ignore a subpoena, even if you're the president of the United States," the Washington state Democrat said. "However, remember the Supreme Court that we have. If this goes all the way up to this Supreme Court ... this Supreme Court seems to make its decisions based on what Donald Trump and the Republican Party want, as opposed to precedents or the Constitution."

Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Politico on Thursday that Trump and his lawyers will decide whether the President will meet with Mueller in a "week to 10 days," his latest estimate on when a final decision could come.

__label__world (CNN) A Kuwaiti court has sentenced a Lebanese man and his wife to death in absentia for the murder of a Filipina maid, the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs said.

The case of Joanna Demafelis, a 29-year-old maid whose body was found in a freezer earlier this year, prompted a diplomatic crisis between Kuwait and the Philippines, with Manila banning its citizens from working in the Gulf state.

Demafelis' body was discovered in the couple's abandoned apartment more than a year after she went missing. Nader Essam Assaf, a Lebanese national, and his wife Mona Hassoun, who is Syrian, were the subject of an Interpol manhunt.

Kuwaiti newspaper al-Qabas said a criminal court had on April 1 sentenced Assaf and his wife to death by hanging.

The Philippines government said Monday it had been informed of the sentence by a Kuwaiti official and added it had obtained a copy of the court decision.

Assaf has been detained in Lebanon, which is now considering a Kuwaiti extradition request, according to the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs. Hassoun was detained in Syria, according to CNN Philippines

The Kuwait Ministry of Justice did not immediately respond to CNN requests for confirmation.

'Swift action'

Philippines foreign affairs secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said Manila noted "the swift action taken by Kuwaiti authorities" in connection with Demafelis' murder.

"This is a very important development in our quest for justice for Joanna," he added.

Jessica, sister of Filipina overseas worker Joanna Demafelis, cries near the casket shortly after its arrival in Manila on February 16.

The discovery of Demafelis' body in February led to a fiery outburst from Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who vowed to "sell his soul to the devil" to bring home workers who were being abused in Kuwait.

After Demafelis' death and other instances of worker abuse, Duterte's government offered free flights home for the 10,900 or so Filipinos who have overstayed their visas, and ordered a ban on the further deployment of workers to Kuwait.

Of more than 250,000 Filipinos in Kuwait, at least 60% are domestic workers who live and work in the homes of their employers for more money than they can earn at home.

Demafelis' family lost contact with her in May 2016, about two years after she arrived in the Middle East, according to CNN Philippines.

They said she never said anything bad about her employers, but had suspicions she was being watched. Demafelis was only able to speak to them three times a year.

During her last phone call, Demafelis said she planned to come home in 2018. But after not hearing from her for a nearly year, Demafelis' family reported her missing, her sister told CNN Philippines.

Investigators tried to find her through the Kuwaiti agency that recruited her, but discovered it had closed down.

Reality Winner, 26, was accused of taking a report about a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack from the NSA facility where she worked and sending it to an online news outlet.

Winner initially faced 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but accepted a plea deal . A federal judge sentenced her to 63 months in prison with three years of supervised release.

The former US Air Force linguist wore an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs as she sat down in the Augusta, Georgia, courtroom Thursday morning. Winner cracked a small grin as she was comforted by one of her attorneys, who defended her character and emphasized she accepted responsibility for her actions.

"She's a good person," said attorney John Bell. "Someone who didn't understand the magnitude of what she was doing." Bell also pointed out that Winner was a first-time offender who had wanted to serve her country.

__label__world Brett Bruen is president of the Global Situation Room, Inc., an international consulting firm. He serves as adjunct faculty member in crisis management at Georgetown University and on boards at Harvard University, University College Dublin and UNICEF. Under President Obama, he was director of global engagement at the White House and spent 12 years as a U.S. diplomat. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

The first major global conflict of the 21st century broke out in the Middle East. It didn't involve Iran. ISIS wasn't a factor. Surprisingly, even Israel found itself on the sidelines.

The initial volley of shots in the battle for the post-US period came from Saudi Arabia. The power struggle was caused by Washington's withdrawal from the world.

This week has seen two incidents which suggest the Kingdom's conduct is less constrained by Western ways. First, Canada's ambassador had a fairly common critique following the detention of a women's rights activist. Instead of issuing their own statement, Riyadh simply cut off ties. Second, an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen that killed dozens of children. Instead of apologizing, the Saudis defended the airstrike, calling it a legitimate military operation. The message seems to be: we no longer feel the need to conform to external expectations.

President Trump had surrendered the United States' role as a principal source of global stability. No longer was the country going to honor alliances, treaties or traditions. No more would its foreign policy be guided by a set of values and an inclusive vision of the world. America First has left other nations, like Canada, to fend for themselves.

Criticism of its human-rights record should be nothing new for Saudi Arabia. The US badgers them, they bristle and then it's back to business as usual. So, when the Canadian ambassador decried the detention of a women's rights activist in a tweet last Friday, Ottawa expected a similar reaction.

Instead, Riyadh unleashed the diplomatic equivalent of its nuclear arsenal. Not only was the ambassador expelled, trade was cut off and even Saudis hospitalized in Canada were moved to other countries.

This was about more than a tough tweet. The kingdom's leaders want to recast its relations with the world. They know the United States is unlikely any longer to rush to the defense of human-rights activists or allies. Such a disproportionate reaction sends a strong message to other nations that would consider criticizing its conduct.

Saudi Arabia realizes that the rules are being rewritten. Influence is being reapportioned. The oil-rich nation saw its opportunity and seized the moment.

America has stood by and watched. It told both countries to work it out among themselves. That's diplomatic speak for you are on your own, Canada.

Out of pride and principle, Ottawa may take a stand and protest against bullying and bad behavior. But ultimately, Canada is likely to lose this scrap.

We are entering an era in which might more often will make right . No single nation will be able to effect tectonic shifts in the global order. Instead, regular tremors will disrupt and inflict damage on international institutions, as well as ideals for which they stand.

Canada, France -- and perhaps even someday again the US -- can push back against these trends. They can try to lead by example. But others will exploit the benefits of the geopolitical shift.

Western sanctions against nations breaking the rules won't be strong enough in the future. Their enticements will have lost much of their luster. The West simply won't have the power to impose its will on the world.

They will have on offer their own prizes and be able to pull out their own penalties. Many of the conditions and concerns that came with Western engagement will be cast aside. It may not replace a Washington-dominated world, but it will certainly be able to contest for influence.

So, what should leaders like Canada's Justin Trudeau and France's Emmanuel Macron do at this stage?

First, they need to lay out a much more compelling case for our shared values and a vision of the world they can create.

Second, that case needs to become much more pragmatic. Vague values like human rights and democracy are a tough sell these days. Instead, they should focus on the tangible value they create. It's a world that brought you the internet, the iPhone and the next major innovation coming just around the corner.

Finally, the West needs to go on the offensive. We spend far too much time reacting, responding and repairing the damage. It's time that we more aggressively defended ourselves. It's time we put those who would endanger our way of life on the defensive.

Other countries -- and our own citizens -- took a lot for granted in the era of American global leadership. Our leaders could be counted on to do what was right. As that period comes to a close, power is diffused not only across to other countries -- but downward.
__label__politics (CNN) The White House has rejected a Turkish offer to release an American pastor in exchange for forgiveness of billions of dollars in US fines on a Turkish bank, expressing that other matters would be considered only after Andrew Brunson is released, a senior administration official told The Wall Street Journal .

The rejection could lead to the US imposing additional sanctions against Turkey sometime this week, the Journal reported. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the United States is willing to do so if Brunson isn't released.

"A real NATO ally wouldn't have arrested Brunson in the first place," the senior White House official told the Journal, referring to Turkey's membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Worsening relations

Brunson has been held in Turkey since 2016 , accused of helping to plot a coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The North Carolina native's case has rapidly soured relations between Washington and Ankara, with the two sides trading increasingly heated rhetoric and retaliatory tariffs.

On Friday, a Turkish high criminal court rejected Brunson's appeal to be released from house arrest and allowed to travel abroad after his appeal was rejected by a lower court.

Later that day, Trump tweeted , "Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years. They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor, who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage. We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on Turkey!"

An evangelical pastor, Brunson has lived in Turkey for more than 23 years with his wife and three children, according to the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), an organization led by attorney Jay Sekulow that has advocated for his release.

But in October 2016, several months after a failed coup attempt in Turkey, Brunson was arrested and accused of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government.

He was formally indicted in March on charges of espionage and having links to terrorist organizations. The charges against Brunson include supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party as well as the Gulen Movement, which Turkey says orchestrated the coup attempt.

Earlier this month, Trump doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey , in what administration officials said was a move to punish Ankara for a lack of progress in bringing about Brunson's release.

The US has also slapped sanctions against Turkey's ministers of justice and interior over the issue, and both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have taken up Brunson's case with Turkish officials.

Tensions in the Turkey-US relationship have been steadily ratcheting up for weeks, even as the NATO allies cooperate on other fronts, perhaps most importantly coordinating over the US air base in Incirlik, Turkey.

In an op-ed in The New York Times earlier this month, Erdogan criticized the US over its actions in the Brunson affair, its reaction to the coup attempt two years ago and its alliance with the People's Protection Units, or the YPG, the fighting group in Syria that Turkey asserts is a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, labeled a terror group by the US.

"Before it is too late, Washington must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives," Erdogan said. "Failure to reverse this trend of unilateralism and disrespect will require us to start looking for new friends and allies."
__label__world Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin touched a political third rail on Wednesday, and it had nothing to do with election meddling, Cold War theatrics or his relationship with US President Donald Trump.

No, it was a pocketbook issue: the Russian government's proposed overhaul of the country's pension system

In a rare address to the nation, Putin took to the airwaves to defend the deeply unpopular new proposal to raise the retirement age, a measure that has dented his popularity and spurred calls for protests.

"The conclusion is clear," Putin said. "The active working-age population is decreasing, along with our capability to pay and adjust pensions for inflation. Therefore, changes are necessary."

Putin makes an address on state TV Wednesday to make the case for raising the retirement age.

It was a buck-stops-here moment for Putin, who said the country "will inevitably face serious demographic problems" by the next decade if there are not changes to Russia's retirement system.

But the speech also underscored that Putin's popularity is not bulletproof.

Putin, who has dominated political life in Russia for 18 years, has enjoyed sky-high approval ratings, and his confrontations with the West often shore up his domestic political support. But Putin is not a Teflon President when it comes to domestic policy matters.

Protests in the streets

The government's proposal to raise the pension age prompted unusual street protests, with demonstrators taking to the streets earlier this summer to express their opposition to the government proposal to reform the pension system, a legacy of the social safety net Russia inherited from the Soviet Union.

Putin's approval ratings, routinely hovering around 80%, dipped in July to 67%, independent pollster Levada-Center found.

Putin, who had previously been on the record opposing any tweaks to the pension system, initially distanced himself from the proposed changes. The government of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev rolled out the package of legislation on the same day as the start of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, effectively burying the bad news amid the fanfare of the tournament.

In his Wednesday remarks, Putin renewed the case for the proposed reforms, but outlined a number of measures to soften their impact. Among other measures, Putin called for raising the retirement age for women to 60 from 55, instead of to 63.

A woman holds a poster protesting an increase in the pension ages from the current 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women during a rally in Moscow on August 21.

"It is not right" to raise the pension age for women by eight years, Putin said. "In our country there is a special attitude to women, a caring one. We understand that they not only work at their main place of work, they usually run the whole house, caring for the family, raising children and fussing over their grandchildren."

It remains to be seen if that revision will satisfy Russians. A proposed five-year increase in retirement age for men, to 65, remains intact. The average Russian male life expectancy is 66, according to the World Health Organization.

In his speech, Putin in part blamed the rising burden on the pension system on the post-Soviet economic collapse of the 1990s, when Russian birth rates dropped. The Russian leader compared the "demographic collapse" of the late 1990s to the impact on population growth caused by World War II.

Critic arrested

Aleksei Kudrin, a former finance minister who heads Russia's audit chamber, praised Putin for offering a "balanced, carefully thought-out solution" that made necessary revisions to the original proposal.

The government may be keen to reverse the impact of long-term population decline, but it also appears to want Russians off the streets. On Monday, a Moscow court sentenced Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to 30 days of administrative arrest for organizing an unsanctioned rally in the capital in January.

Navalny had called for nationwide protests on September 9 against an unpopular government proposal to raise Russia's retirement age, and in a statement on Twitter that followed Putin's speech, Navalny urged his supporters to turn out for the protests, which occur on the same day as local elections in Russia.

"Well, if this decision does not seem to you to be 'balanced and carefully thought-out,' then go out on Sept. 9 to protest against raising the retirement age," Navalny tweeted.

The proposed changes to the pension system come as the Russian government braces for possible new US sanctions that threaten to hit the ruble and the spending power of ordinary Russians.

But once again, those sanctions may not translate to diminished support for Putin: A recent Pew Research Center study found that an overwhelming majority of Russians -- 85% -- think it is the US that interferes in the domestic affairs of other countries.
__label__world (CNN) The tiny Pacific nation of Nauru has demand China apologize for the "crazy" behavior of its senior diplomat at the Pacific Island Forum, a gathering of 18 regional leaders hosted by Nauru this week.

The row erupted Tuesday after Nauru's President Baron Waqa prevented Du Qiwen, the head of China's delegation, from presenting a speech on climate change, Australia's SBS news reported.

The Chinese delegation stormed out of the session, and in a news briefing Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister spokeswoman Hua Chunying made a pointed comment about Waqa's role in the incident.

"The relevant person should have understood that only those who behave with dignity will win respect from others," she said. "The same is true for a country. Big or small, one country should conduct itself with dignity and self-respect."

It's not the first time the two nations -- one home to 1.3 billion people, the other 11,000 -- have clashed.

__label__world (CNN) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will talk tough on terrorism to Pakistan and attempt to strengthen his country's links with India during what is likely to be a difficult and potentially testing visit to South Asia beginning Wednesday.

The visit comes as the US tilts away from Pakistan , while deepening strategic and economic ties with India in a bid to counter China's increasing influence in the " Indo-Pacific " region -- Pompeo's preferred term for the area that stretches from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India.

Pompeo will have to perform a tricky balancing act, analysts say, as Pakistan is fast falling within China's sphere of influence and its arch-rival India is smarting over a series of trade threats and insults from President Donald Trump.

"US-Pakistan ties have deteriorated significantly," said Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "US patience across parties has grown thin. Pakistanis generally believe that the United States is a fair-weather friend, in contrast to the 'all-weather' friendship of China."

On US-India relations, Ayres added that "the unprecedented degree to which President Trump focuses on at times arbitrary and even trivial economic issues to measure the health of foreign relations has created new uncertainty."

Central to Pompeo's visit will be his first meeting with newly elected Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Pompeo, who is scheduled to visit Islamabad for several hours on Wednesday, September 5, before moving on to Delhi, is due to meet Khan for high-level talks. Few expect the meeting to be smooth.

Last month Islamabad disputed Washington's account of a phone call between Pompeo and Khan, denying there had been any discussion on militants operating in Pakistan.

Khan is known for his criticism of US policy in Afghanistan, but he said after becoming the country's prime minister last month that he wants to improve relations with Washington.

However, earlier this week the US, frustrated by Islamabad's reluctance to crack down on Afghan Taliban militants in its territory, canceled $300m in military aid to Pakistan , further complicating relations.

"This was an inevitable move," said Michael Kugelman, South Asia expert at the US-based Wilson Center. "For months, US officials had been telegraphing a message of unhappiness about a lack of clear movement on the Pakistani side to address the terrorism issue."

Islamabad reacted angrily, claiming that the funds were owed to Pakistan for counter-terrorism operations carried out at Washington's behest.

The Trump administration has also signaled major reservations about the IMF granting Pakistan another bailout as Islamabad assumes billions of dollars in debt for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multi-billion dollar series of Chinese funded infrastructure projects stretching from the Chinese border to Pakistan's deep water ports.

"As a result, Pakistan-US relations are currently in a volatile state, though the prior status quo was itself volatile, and had grown increasingly untenable from the US perspective," said Jeff Smith, a research fellow at Heritage Foundation.

Smith added that Khan's views may differ from the Pakistan military's on Afghanistan, but the army remains in control of defense and foreign policy.

The Afghanistan question

Pompeo is also due to meet the Pakistani army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, during his visit. The general held meetings with Khan three times this week, but it is not known what was discussed.

Husein Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US and a director at the Hudson Institute, told CNN that although Washington has previously made threats to Pakistan over its alleged support of Afghan militants, Trump's administration means business.

"What is different this time is the willingness of the US side to recognize that Pakistan may not just be a difficult ally that needs to be persuaded to cooperate a bit more, but a country that is no longer an ally," he said.

However, analysts said Pompeo should try to keep Pakistan on board as its links to the Taliban make it a key player in efforts to achieve a peace settlement with Afghanistan. Pakistan also provides vital military supply routes to landlocked Afghanistan.

"Given that Kabul and Washington have now signed off on direct talks between the US and the Taliban, Washington may not think Islamabad will play that important a role in helping bringing the Taliban to talks," said Kugelman.

"But, if a process of reconciliation begins, it will be a long and difficult slog, and Pakistan would still be useful if not essential in such a process, given its close ties to the Taliban," he added.

Afghanistan will probably be discussed again by Pompeo during his visit to New Delhi, where he will be accompanied by Defense Secretary James Mattis.

"India will likely look to impress upon Pompeo and Mattis that an abrupt withdrawal of US and international troops from Afghanistan will create greater instability in the region," said Ayres.

"India will likely also focus on their own constructive development assistance to Afghanistan and their work developing the Chabahar port in Iran," she added.

Chabahar, which would be a conduit for Indian supplies to Afghanistan, is seen by Islamabad as a rival to its Gwadar port, the mainstay of China's $60 billion Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure investment in Pakistan.

US support of Indian interests in Afghanistan has spooked Pakistan, which aims to help install a friendly regime in Kabul.

India strategy

The main thrust of Pompeo's focus in New Delhi will be the Trump administration's Indo-Pacific economic strategy, seen by many as its response to China's Belt and Road initiative.

The United States and India have been allies for a while, but Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have significantly strengthened their bonds.

"India is now America's main South Asian ally and partner," said Haqqani. "The US hopes to act in concert with India to contain China in the Indo-Pacific."

But in recent months Trump has cast uncertainty on the relationship, said Manoj Joshi, fellow at Observer Research Foundation, by sparking tit-for-tat tariff threats and pressuring India not to buy oil from Iran.

Also Trump's lampooning of Modi's accent and his threat of US sanctions if India imports Russian hardware have also cast a shadow on the relationship.

"To be sure, there does appear to be an air of unease in Delhi owing to an uptick in trade frictions and a general sense of unpredictability about the Trump Administration's priorities and intentions," said Smith.

Dhruva Jaishankar, a fellow at Brookings India, told CNN that "on bilateral issues, relations have been more complicated, especially on trade and to a lesser degree on immigration".

Joshi said the two side will "seek to find ways to minimize friction arising from Trump's actions against Iran, trade and the Russian sanctions."

But, analysts agreed that overall US-India relations have improved under Trump in terms of geopolitical and military links.

"On strategic relations, ties have actually deepened and convergences have accelerated," said Jaishankar. "This extends to continuing efforts to enable India access to advanced US military equipment based on a reduction in licensing requirements and offers of new kinds of technology."

The establishment of the first India-US "2+2" foreign and defense ministers dialogue was itself a significant accomplishment, said Smith.

"The fundamentals of the relationship remain sound and the geopolitical logic that's driven the historic India-US partnership is as compelling as ever," he added.

However, India remains concerned about the US's diminished stature on the world stage under Trump. "President Trump's stepping back from the globalization project and (China's) President Xi making efforts to step in are developments that India would be concerned about," said Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru university.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The United States is ending all funding to the United Nations agency tasked with supporting Palestinian refugees, the US State Department said Friday, describing the body as "irredeemably flawed."

The United States has long been the biggest single donor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, known as UNRWA, donating more than $350 million to the agency in 2017.

The agency offers educational, health and social services across the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon to more than 5 million registered Palestinian refugees. It educates about 500,000 children in nearly 700 schools and its doctors see more than 9 million patients in nearly 150 primary health clinics every year.

Palestinian children walk outside the Askar refugee camp, near Nablus in the West Bank, in January 2018.

In January this year, the United States said it would withhold $65 million , from an initial installment of $125 million it was expected to hand over to UNRWA at the start of the year. The US said it wanted UNRWA to reform and believed other countries should increase the amounts they contributed to the agency.

"When we made a US contribution of $60 million in January, we made it clear that the United States was no longer willing to shoulder the very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA's costs that we had assumed for many years," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement Friday.

"Several countries, including Jordan, Egypt, Sweden, Qatar, and the UAE have shown leadership in addressing this problem, but the overall international response has not been sufficient."

Nauert criticized the agency's business model and fiscal practices as "unsustainable" and having been in "crisis mode" for many years.

"The United States will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation," she said. "We are very mindful of and deeply concerned regarding the impact upon innocent Palestinians, especially school children, of the failure of UNRWA and key members of the regional and international donor community to reform and reset the UNRWA way of doing business."

Chris Gunness, spokesman for UNRWA, voiced "deep regret" over the US decision and pushed back against its criticism of UNRWA's work.

"We reject in the strongest possible terms the criticism that UNRWA's schools, health centers, and emergency assistance programs are 'irredeemably flawed,'" he said.

"These very programs have a proven track record in creating one of the most successful human development processes and results in the Middle East. The international state community, our donors and host countries have consistently praised UNRWA for its achievements and standards."

Foreign Policy first reported the Trump administration's decision to end funding for the UN agency, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949.

A senior administration official told CNN the decision was made at a meeting between Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but that US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley had also been pushing for the move.

The Trump administration will also call for a large reduction in the number of Palestinians considered to be refugees, the administration official and a regional diplomat briefed on the decision told CNN.

The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the decision.

A senior administration official criticized the agency in a statement to CNN earlier this month, saying that it "has perpetuated and exacerbated the refugee crisis and must be changed so the Palestinian people can reach their full potential."

The statement followed a Foreign Policy report in early August that revealed leaked emails in which Kushner pressed fellow officials to engage in "an honest and sincere effort to disrupt UNRWA."

'Right of return'

Removal of Palestinians' refugee status would effectively mean they would lose the "right of return" to homes that are now in Israel and reclaim lost property -- a move that would have enormous significance for the approximately 5.3 million Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA.

During the Arab-Israeli War of 1948/49, which followed the establishment of the State of Israel, about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from or fled their homes, a period the Palestinians call "Nakba," meaning catastrophe.

Most Palestinians consider the right of return to be an inalienable right of the Palestinian people. It has long been considered what is called a "final status" issue in peace talks, an acknowledgment that it is among the toughest areas for Israelis and Palestinians to reach agreement.

This would be the second final status issue that the US President has sought to take off the table, the first being Jerusalem.

JUST WATCHED UN refugee agency facing finanical crisis Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH UN refugee agency facing finanical crisis 02:08

For decades, US policy was to avoid declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel in the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, as the Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their capital and its final status was supposed to be left to negotiations. But Trump upended that policy in December when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital

Anat Berko, an Israeli lawmaker with the governing Likud party, told CNN she supported the US move on UNRWA and said she hoped other countries would follow suit.

"An end to UNRWA will bring an end to the 'refugee forever' status. We cannot solve any conflict with this definition of refugees. Humanitarian aid -- yes. But UNRWA -- no," Berko said.

Al-Awda, a Florida-based NGO that advocates for the right of return, talks of the "fundamental, inalienable, historical, legal, individual and collective rights of all Palestinian refugees to return to their original towns, villages and lands anywhere in Palestine from which they were expelled."

Israeli media outlets have reported concerns in some quarters that serious cuts to UNRWA's budget could exacerbate tensions on the ground in the Palestinian territories and, by impacting the provision of basic public services, strengthen the hand of the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.

US orders cut in West Bank, Gaza aid

News that the Trump administration will end all funding to UNRWA comes on the heels of Trump ordering the United States to cut $200 million in aid to Palestinians.

CNN reported last week that the President directed the State Department to withdraw $200 million in aid that was originally planned for programs in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a senior State Department official.

Nauert told reporters Tuesday that a review ordered by Trump earlier this year of US assistance to the Palestinians had established that that money "is not in the best interests of the US national interest and also at this time does not provide value to the US taxpayer."

Ahmad Shami, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, accused the Trump administration in a statement earlier this week of seeking to strip millions of Palestinians of their refugee status on top of cutting aid funds.

"After using humanitarian aid to blackmail and pressure the Palestinian leadership to submit to the empty plan known as 'the deal of the century,' the Trump administration plans to commit an immoral scandal against Palestinian refugees by giving itself the right to abolish the historical rights of Palestinian refugees without any legitimacy," he said.

"This is a clear looting of our humanity leading to more chaos in the region."

Shami called on the international community to "stop the gambling schema of Trump and Netanyahu to endorse colonization, apartheid, and denial of Palestinian fundamental rights."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently said the work done by UNRWA should be picked up by the UN's main refugee agency, the UNHCR.

Netanyahu told foreign journalists in January: "The perpetuation of the dream of bringing the descendants of refugees back to Jaffa is what sustains this conflict. UNRWA is part of the problem, not part of the solution."

Jaffa was one of the largest Arab towns in British Mandate Palestine that would become part of Israel in 1948.

But Gunness told CNN that the UN agency fundamentally rejected Netanyahu's criticism.

"It is not UNRWA that perpetuates the conflict, it is the conflict that perpetuates UNRWA; it is the failure of the political parties through negotiations to produce an overall peace agreement and thereby resolve the refugee crisis," said Gunness. "That is what makes UNRWA's existence necessary."

UNRWA schools open

Pierre Krähenbühl, Commissioner-General of UNRWA, said this week that the agency's 711 schools in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, were opening on time for their 526,000 students despite its current "unprecedented" $217 million deficit.

"For decades, donors have recognized that UNRWA is a force multiplier for stability in one of the most the volatile regions around the world," he wrote in an op-ed on the UNRWA website

Krähenbühl noted the "regrettable" decision by the Trump administration early this year to cut its planned funding to UNRWA, but also paid tribute to the "strong solidarity" shown by the broader international community whose increased or new donations had gone some way to filling the gap.

The German government pledged Friday to increase significantly its funding to UNRWA, Reuters news agency reported, adding that German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had made clear that other nations would also need to step in to meet the existing shortfall.

The United States in 2016 agreed to a new 10-year military aid package for Israel worth $38 billion over 10 years, according to congressional and administration sources. That was an increase on an approximately $30 billion decade-long deal that expires this year.

__label__politics (CNN) Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's vocal support of the #MeToo movement demonstrates her belief in the continued fight for equality now being led by younger generations, Clara Spera, the granddaughter of the judge, told CNN.

My grandmother "understands that there are generational shifts when it comes to seeking certain rights and equality," Spera told Poppy Harlow and Jeffrey Toobin in the premiere episode of CNN's new podcast series, "RBG: Beyond Notorious," which was released Monday.

"What she may have been fighting [against] in the seventies -- actual black and white discrimination written into laws on paper -- while there may be less of that type of gender-based discrimination now, there are perhaps similarly insidious types of discrimination that appear in different ways," Spera told Harlow and Toobin, adding she believes that progress won in social movements must be codified in law to have a lasting impact.

The podcast series tells the story of the life and times of Ginsburg. The fifth episode revisits the 1970s, when Ginsburg worked as an attorney and the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project.

At that time, she took on clients who had experienced gender-based discrimination, arguing six such cases before the Supreme Court.

__label__world (CNN) Police in Indonesia have killed dozens of low-level criminals ahead of hosting the 2018 Asian Games, Amnesty International alleged in a report Thursday.

According to Amnesty, the deaths of 31 people between January and August of this year occurred in the host cities of the games, which begin in Jakarta and Palembang on Saturday.

The report also said that police had killed at least 77 people across the country during the same period, and noted a 64% increase from 2017 of those killed accused of committing petty crimes.

The human rights group described the tactics used by the police as "unnecessary and excessive."

"In the months leading up to the Asian Games, the authorities promised to improve security for all. Instead, we have seen the police shooting and killing dozens of people across the country with almost zero accountability for the deaths," said Amnesty International Indonesia Executive Director Usman Hamid.

__label__politics (CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she is a capitalist to her "bones."

And yet, the pair are widely viewed to be competing for the same territory in a potential 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Not that anyone should be surprised. Both Sanders and Warren made their names railing at the excesses and failures of an increasing unequal economy -- one that voters across the ideological spectrum routinely describe as unfair or, in many cases, "rigged."

Polling from a variety of sources has for years now consistently turned up evidence of frustration rooted in decades of economic dislocation, spanning both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2018, buoyed in part by the rise of the progressive left, we're beginning to see more Americans take a deeper look at the system underlying -- and, in some cases, feeding -- their anger: capitalism.

In a Fox News poll out this week, 36% of Americans said it would be a "good thing" for the country to "move away from capitalism to more socialism," while 51% called it a "bad thing." Most of the chatter of late has surrounded socialism, but the judgment rendered here on capitalism is just as interesting. Perhaps more. On the three previous occasions the question had been asked, support for a move had never surpassed 23% (2009) and the opposition always came in at no less than 64%.

Those numbers reinforced some of the takeaways from another recent headline-grabbing survey, from Gallup, which found that positive views of capitalism among 18- to 29-year-olds had plummeted this decade, from 68% in 2010 to just 45% in 2018.

Three Palestinians killed, more than 100 injured in Jerusalem clashes

Jerusalem (CNN) Three Israelis were killed Friday in a stabbing attack in a West Bank settlement, Israeli authorities said. The attack followed clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in Jerusalem's Old City, in which three Palestinians were also killed, according to Palestinian officials.

A Palestinian wielding a knife stabbed and killed three Israelis in Halamish, a settlement located north of Ramallah. A fourth Israeli was wounded in the attack, the Israeli MDA emergency services told CNN.

MDA Director Eli Bin said the attacker was shot and severely wounded, and has also been evacuated to hospital. The Israeli military confirmed in a statement that the assailant had been shot.

In a statement posted on Facebook prior to the attack, the assailant said he was motivated by the Israeli government's recent restrictions on al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, according to an Israeli military spokesman. The attacker climbed a fence and "was able to penetrate one of the houses, which was close to the village perimeter," said the spokesman, who did not want to be named.

Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack. "We bless the heroic Halamish operation which came as a result to the Zionist occupation violations and crimes against our people in Jerusalem and al-Aqsa Mosque," the group said on Twitter.

__label__politics (CNN) Bernie Sanders' acolytes cheered this past weekend as the Democratic National Committee changed superdelegate and caucus rules for the 2020 primary season. They really shouldn't have.

While on the surface the rule changes seemed to benefit progressives, a closer look suggests the exact opposite. These rule changes will likely harm the progressive cause more than help it.

The superdelegate change really is not much of a change at all. Yes, superdelegates won't have any real power on the first ballot. They can still vote on the second ballot though.

Remember, Sanders lost among pledged delegates in 2016. Superdelegates didn't cause him to lose. Eight years earlier, Clinton's large early superdelegate lead didn't mean anything when Obama ended up winning among pledged delegates. The superdelegates fell in-line.

Only if no candidate has a majority of pledged delegates would superdelegates have likely come into play without any rule changes. The same as it is now.

__label__politics STATEMENT OF JARED C. KUSHNER TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES



July 24, 2017

I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period.

I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight.

My Role in the Trump for President Campaign

Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law's campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.

Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials.

All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign's ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not.

It is also important to note that a campaign's success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people.

Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons

When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange.

With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump's speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America's foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.

Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, "What is the name of the Russian ambassador?" Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred.

The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other's meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as "Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner." No one else was mentioned.

I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote "Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting." I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form.

There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname "Guccifer400." This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump's tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all travelling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply -- which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again.

To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.

Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons

The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited.

On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador's name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks -- on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President's National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day.

The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his "generals." He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a "secret back channel." I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions.

Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13.

The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts -- one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.

To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.

Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form

There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it.

In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017.

That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had "numerous contacts with foreign officials" and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form.

It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan's King Abdullah II, Israel's Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before.

Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be "update[d], clarif[ied], and explain[ed]" as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting.

****

As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the

investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved.

It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Wednesday that former FBI Director James Comey was not fired because of the Russia investigation -- a statement directly at odds with the President's own comments on Comey's dismissal.

"Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!" Trump tweeted.

However, Trump had told NBC News last year that he was thinking of " this Russia thing " when he decided to fire Comey.

When the President fired Comey last May, the White House initially cited a recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who sharply criticized Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.

A few days later, after Comey's ouster, Trump told NBC News' Lester Holt in an interview, "regardless of (Rosenstein's) recommendation, I was going to fire Comey."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Without consulting the White House, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats decided to reassert the intelligence community's assessment that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election Monday, publicly breaking with President Donald Trump, who earlier had expressed doubts about that finding while standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Coats faced "a choice" after Trump issued a stunning rebuke of the US intelligence community, saying he doesn't "see any reason why" Russia would be responsible for interfering in the 2016 election -- touting Putin's vigorous denial then pivoting to complaints about the Democratic National Committee's server and missing emails from Hillary Clinton's personal account.

Rather than staying quiet, Coats opted to issue a strongly worded statement backing the intelligence assessment that Russia did, in fact, interfere in the election. He also reaffirmed his commitment to "provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security."

A senior intelligence official told CNN that it was Coats' decision to release the statement following internal discussions Monday morning and that it was not cleared with the White House beforehand.

"The role of the Intelligence Community is to provide the best information and fact-based assessments possible for the President and policymakers. We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security," the statement said.

She is vice president of communications and strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Follow her at @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) This week we learned that an infamous Donald Trump slogan for his opponent -- "Crooked Hillary" -- may have been weaponized on his behalf by Cambridge Analytica in its campaign ads for Trump. In a report by Britain's Channel 4, Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, claims he orchestrated the online viral growth of some of the most damaging and false narratives about Hillary Clinton -- including the "Crooked Hillary" slogan.

Why does this matter?

Because the Trump team has been attempting to minimize the role of Cambridge Analytica, including its ties to the firm and the impact of the firm's work, for months.

This story, particularly in relation to Cambridge Analytica's work practices, isn't entirely new. There was extensive reporting on the role of the firm in targeting voters back to 2016. News reports at the time confirmed that the Trump team shelled out $5 million in September alone to Cambridge Analytica and referred to the firm as its "secret weapon."

But over the same period our understanding of and concern about the role the Kremlin played in disseminating disinformation across social media channels and the extent to which Russia pushed false narratives about Hilary Clinton has also increased.

As has the work of special counselor Robert Mueller, who is leaving no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of the what, how and why of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election -- and the possibility that the Trump campaign may be connected.

And now the Cambridge Analytica story is beginning to emerge with even greater detail, raising some major red flags.

Not only did the Trump campaign pay Cambridge Analytica millions of dollars to get information to target voters, but we also know now that the Russian researcher who harvested the Facebook data of millions of Americans -- which he then sold to Cambridge Analytica -- also worked with a group at Russia's St. Petersburg University in 2014 on a similar project. Seems like more than a strange coincidence.

Defenders of Cambridge make a similar argument to that of many former Trump campaign staffers and supporters: They simply weren't competent enough to coordinate with the Russians and meddle in an election. That spin rings hollow when it comes from supporters of the Trump team, given the number of undisclosed meetings and the clear willingness to accept damaging information on Trump's opponent. And it certainly does not fly when this same firm claiming naivete also employed a Russian researcher to mine the personal data of Americans and perhaps took advantage of one of Trump's favorite campaign slogans.

There are valid questions about Facebook's policy, too, and how the company didn't disclose -- after it became aware of the issue in 2015 -- that a Russian academic had sold the personal data of millions of Americans to a firm working for the Trump campaign.

And there are valid questions about whether Russia's election meddling changed the outcome. The truth is we don't know for sure.

But regardless of the impact and about the steps that will and should be taken from here, the legal and political question is about the intent of the Trump team. Did the Trump team, with the help of a data firm it hired, coordinate with the Russians to meddle in the election in 2016?

And no one has stated the thrust of the issue more clearly than Hillary Clinton : "The real question is how did the Russians know how to target their messages so precisely to undecided voters in Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania -- that is really the nub of the question. So, if they were getting advice from say Cambridge Analytica, or someone else, about 'OK here are the 12 voters in this town in Wisconsin -- that's whose Facebook pages you need to be on to send these messages' that indeed would be very disturbing."

While there isn't definitive evidence the Russians did such precise targeting -- as Clinton's comments suggest -- there is growing evidence that the Russians gathered intel on Americans and bought anti-Clinton ads on Facebook and other forms of social media to influence the electorate.

And President Trump is really not helping matters by congratulating the very man behind the meddling in the US presidential on his re-election, which he achieved by excluding candidates who presented any real threat of winning the Russian presidency.
__label__world (CNN) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has called for the Chinese government to tone down its behavior in the South China Sea, warning ongoing tensions could spark an accidental conflict.

Speaking Tuesday at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, Duterte said the heavily-contested region could become a "flashpoint."

"I hope that China would temper at least its behavior. I do not want to quarrel with China," he added.

The Philippines and China have been engaged in territorial disputes over parts of the South China Sea for decades, along with Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.

Beijing claims an enormous swathe of territory in the region, and has heavily-fortified artificial islands under its control in the Spratly and Paracel chains.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) North Korea's state newspaper accused the US of "hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK" while "having a dialogue with a smile on its face" Sunday following a report on South Korean radio that American forces in Japan were running drills aimed at invading Pyongyang.

"We can not but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the US as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face," the commentary from North Korea's Rodong Sinmun said, citing South Korean reports that US special units had been flown to the Philippines as part of an invasion drill.

"The US would be sadly mistaken if it thinks that it can browbeat someone through trite 'gunboat diplomacy' which it used to employ as an almighty weapon in the past and attain its sinister intention," it added.

US Forces Japan (USFJ) told CNN on Monday it was "not aware of the drills" mentioned in North and South Korean media reports.

"In general, US aircrafts and ships operate from Japan every day in support of our commitments to our allies and partners in the region and in the interests of regional peace and security," Col. John Hutcheson, the Director of public affairs of USFJ, said in a statement.

__label__world Seoul (CNN) It was late at night when the police knocked on Choi's door and showed her a video which turned her life upside down.

The blurry footage was of a naked woman she recognized as herself, walking casually through her apartment on the 22nd floor of a building in downtown Seoul.

It had been taken through a window with a telephoto lens from the roof of a neighboring building. Choi -- who requested she only be identified by her last name -- was left speechless. No apartments looked into hers and she had been completely unaware of being watched, or even that she could possibly be watched.

She couldn't sleep that night, consumed by a growing paranoia that someone was still spying on her.

"I'm scared to be at home right now because that's where it happened," she told CNN. "I was filmed at my own place so I don't want to be here but also I'm scared to leave the apartment even though it's broad daylight."

Since 2011, the number of cases of illegal filming in South Korea has leaped from 1,300 a year to more than 6,000 in 2017. Women have been recorded in their homes, had upskirt photos taken on the streets, and been caught on spy cams hidden in toilets and changing rooms. Footage has been shared widely online, uploaded to streaming sites and shared on voyeur forums.

In the past four months, tens of thousands of women have joined protests in central Seoul under the slogan "My Life is Not Your Porn." Wearing masks and displaying banners demanding the government to take action to protect them and prosecute men caught filming, the anger and frustration among the protesters was palpable, compounded by the long delay in seeing even slight official action.

On Monday, a special squad of women inspectors began daily checks of 20,000 public toilets in Seoul, with plans for tens of thousands of private toilets to also be scoured for spy cams. Some districts have dubbed the teams "safety sheriffs," kitting them out with broad-brimmed cowboy hats.

But while this approach has received widespread press coverage and promotion by the local authorities, activists and victims say it's not enough, and they still face a lack of interest and understanding from police and some lawmakers. They also point to similar programs that have been in place in the capital since 2016 but have not produced any tangible results or found any spy cams, with some activists accusing the entire project of just being security theater.

Women's safety sheriffs inspect a toilet in Seocho, a district of Seoul. The South Korean capital recently announced plans to conduct daily patrols of restrooms for hidden cameras.

Stopping the spread

In Seoul's swanky business district of Gangnam, Lee Ji-soo sits at her computer all day scrubbing the internet of photos and videos published without the subject's permission.

Hers is a new profession created by the rising frequency and public awareness of illegal filming: the "digital undertaker."

Once she is alerted to a piece of content -- such as spy cam footage, upskirt videos, or sex tapes leaked by ex-partners (also known as revenge porn) -- Lee and her team use proprietary software to search for all copies of it online. They then send a letter, or a legal notice if necessary, to website administrators requesting it be taken down.

Lee Ji-soo works as a "digital undertaker," helping victims remove illegal photos and videos from the internet.

While most websites are willing to remove illegal videos or those shared without permission, Lee said there is a "golden window" of about 10 days after a video is uploaded during which it can be easily scrubbed from the internet. After that it gets more and more difficult, as copies spread to other websites and servers outside Korea.

How fast such videos spread is especially problematic for victims of hidden camera pornography, most of whom are completely unaware they have been recorded and may not become so until months or even years after the video is first uploaded. The speed of transmission is increased by forums and websites dedicated to sharing illegal upskirt videos and revenge porn, many of which have proven difficult to stamp out.

Lee said her company had seen a spike in searches for "digital undertakers" and requests for help as the issue has received more attention in South Korea.

"The most common things that the clients are saying -- and they are quite heartbreaking -- are 'I want to die' or 'I cannot leave my house.' Especially the victims of spy cam or illegally taken videos say that when they encounter people on the street, they feel like they would be recognized," she said.

Thousands of women protest against illegal filming on August 4, 2018 in Seoul, South Korea.

Asked how women can defend themselves from being a victim of this type of crime, Lee was quick to point out they are not remotely at fault for appearing in these videos.

"In a way, these people were just walking on the street when a rock had unexpectedly landed on them," she said. "So I cannot tell these people to change their behavior and I shouldn't either."

Earlier this year, the government began offering similar services to Lee's company. The Digital Sex Crimes Victim Support Center provides consultation and removal services, and officials said that within the first 50 days of operation it helped 500 victims remove more than 2,200 videos online. It also provides victims legal support to file criminal charges and takedown notices.

The government has also said it will provide $4.5 million in funds to local authorities to increase patrols of toilets and changing rooms to search for spy cameras.

Justice denied

While the authorities have been keen to be seen to take action, spurred by the mass protests in downtown Seoul, Choi said the biggest frustration in her case came from her experience with the police.

Unlike in most instances of illegal filming, the man spying on Choi was actually spotted in the act and the police called. But Choi learned that he was only briefly interrogated and later released without charge. His house was not searched for a full week after the incident, during which time Choi suspected he may have destroyed evidence of other illegal filming.

She blamed the police for not taking the matter seriously, and said "if this is how the law works here then the law needs to change."

A general view of Seoul at night. Choi was naked at home alone in her apartment when she was filmed through her 22nd floor window.

Responding to a request for comment, police told CNN officers made the decision not to arrest the perpetrator after he willingly accompanied them to the police station and surrendered his camera and memory card. They said the delay in checking his home was due to a wait to process a search warrant.

Choi's suspicions about official attitudes towards illegal filming are supported by the data however. While the current law states that those caught illegally taking or distributing videos can be sentenced to up to five years in prison, only about 5% of convictions result in jail time, and most perpetrators receive fines or suspended sentences, according to a study by the Korean Women Lawyers Association.

There was outrage in August when, after months of protests by women calling for stricter sentencing of the mostly male perpetrators a woman was jailed for illegally photographing a naked man during a life drawing session.

Police also attracted widespread criticism after they released -- and subsequently withdrew -- a public information campaign depicting the perpetrators of illegal filming as mischievous boys and encouraging the public to take selfies with cut-outs of the childishly dressed mascots.

Last week, lawmaker Kim Young-ho of the ruling Democratic Party proposed changes to the law to impose harsher sentences on the illegal filming of sexual acts, including upskirt videos.

"When an illegal video spreads, it robs a person and ruins their life. Though it's a grave crime, the law and the punishment had not been strict," he told CNN.

While the bill is expected to pass this year, Kim warned that the law still needs to be tweaked further.

"If the victim is clothed, there is no legal ground for punishment. So in order to protect the privacy, we proposed the bill that seeks to punish the act of filming without permission even if the subject had been clothed," he said.

A protester holds up a sign at a demonstration in central Seoul on August 4. More protests are expected this month.

The ability to impose stricter punishments does not necessarily mean courts and prosecutors will take advantage of this, however. Beyond the law, Choi said general attitudes within South Korean society need to change, especially among men, many of whom she felt still do not take illegal filming seriously.

For her, the experience has dramatically changed her outlook and assessment of the country she lives in.

"You can never feel comfortable in your own body if you're a woman here," she said. "That's how I started feeling. Just because I'm born as a woman, people objectify me. People objectify my body, even when I'm in the most private place."
__label__world (CNN) The death of Bollywood icon Sridevi has prompted an outpouring of grief across the Indian subcontinent, where her strong female-led movies dominated the box office throughout the '80s and '90s, helping to redefine the role of women in South Asian cinema.

If Bollywood is the world's biggest film industry, then Sridevi was undoubtedly its queen. Her funeral, held in Mumbai Wednesday , attracted the cream of Indian cinema, as well as thousands of mourners who lined the streets around the crematorium to pay their final respects.

The industry's first major breakout superstar, Sridevi's fame coincided with a period of growing consumer wealth within India, as younger audiences looked to cinema to provide a new, more metropolitan identity.

The result was an entire generation of young women, across India and beyond, who came of age inspired by Sridevi's onscreen performances, dance-routines and songs.

In arguably her most famous role as investigative journalist Seema Sohnithe, in the 1987 superhero blockbuster-smash "Mr India," Sridevi redefined the typical damsel in distress female lead, mixing a daring sexuality with intelligence and comic charm to outsmart the bad guys.

__label__politics (CNN) The Supreme Court confirmation battle that President Donald Trump triggered with his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh on Monday night may shine a harsh spotlight on the Senate's historic bias in favor of small states.

Kavanaugh could be confirmed by a narrow Senate Republican majority rooted in the nation's smaller states over the virtually unified objections of a Democratic Senate minority strongest in the largest states. Kavanaugh in turn could cement a Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority that would control America's legal framework for years -- regardless of how much of the nation's future population and economic growth flows into the largest states.

The Senate's bias toward small states isn't new: An extended standoff over the issue nearly derailed the convention that wrote the Constitution. Yet the small-state bias may now be more relevant than ever, because it aligns more precisely than at earlier points in American history with the tectonic forces separating the two parties, including urbanization, racial and religious diversity, and the transition to an information-based economy. As small and large states separate even further along those dimensions in the years ahead, the constitutional compromise that provided each state two senators -- in a narrow vote held 231 years ago next week -- could provoke growing tension.

"The Senate diverges wildly from (the principle of) one person one vote," says Frances Lee, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland and co-author of the book "Sizing Up the Senate: The Unequal Consequences of Equal Representation." "That's been true since the start, from the very beginning. But it matters more when large and small states differ in a way that is highly relevant for party politics."

In the Senate, the parties don't entirely sort across the large state, small state continuum. Republicans currently hold all the Senate seats across the large and growing Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Texas and Arizona -- though Democrats are growing more competitive in each of them. Democrats in turn remain strong in smaller New England states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island. Most of the Rust Belt's big population centers are perennial battlegrounds between the parties, including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Though Trump carried all four in 2016, Democratic senators in each of them are now considered solid favorites for re-election in November.

Big states v. small states

But generally, the Republican Senate coalition is centered on smaller states, while Democrats rely relatively much more on the largest states. Republicans now hold 35 Senate seats and Democrats just 25 across the 30 smallest states. Democrats in turn hold 24, and Republicans just 16, Senate seats in the 20 largest states. Put another way, about half of the Democratic senators represent the 20 largest states, while over two-thirds of the Republicans represent the 30 smallest states.

The contrast between the two Senate coalitions emerges even more clearly when looking at the total population of the states each side represents. One way of measuring the difference is to assign half of each state's population to each senator. Measured that way, the 51 Republican senators now represent about 143 million people, according to the latest Census Bureau state population estimates. The 49 Democratic senators represent about 182 million people, nearly 40 million more. That's about 2.8 million people per Republican senator and 3.7 million people per Democratic senator.

Some analysts might argue that comparison overstates the difference, because California alone accounts for almost 40 million people in the Democratic ledger. But Texas puts 28 million people in the Republican column. Eliminating the largest state on each side still leaves the Democratic senators representing nearly 30 million more people than their Republican counterparts.

If every Republican votes for Kavanaugh, every Democrat votes no and Arizona's ailing GOP Sen. John McCain doesn't vote, as is likely, the senators opposing the choice would represent over 42 million more people than those supporting it.

The sheer disparity in size between the largest and smallest states is the most visible source of questions about the Senate's democratic legitimacy. That divergence is sometimes summarized as the ratio between California and Wyoming, the largest and smallest states: Each California senator represents nearly 19.8 million people, over 68 times as many as the 290,000 each Wyoming senator represents.

Yet even that contrast, while gaping, probably doesn't capture the central force that could significantly heighten tension over the Senate's structure in the years ahead. The real rub could be the widening divergence between the large and small states, not only in their partisan leanings, but also in their exposure to the most powerful forces reshaping American life in the 21st century.

Critically, the small states tend to be less touched than the large ones by the nation's growing racial and religious diversity. Many of the smaller states remain more white and native-born than the nation overall. Wyoming, the smallest state, for instance, ranks 46th in the share of immigrants in its population and 43rd in the share of its under-18 population that is nonwhite. North Dakota and South Dakota, also in the five smallest states, rank 46th and 43rd respectively in immigrant population, and 42nd and 38th in the nonwhite share of their youth population. Montana and Maine, among the 10 smallest states, rank in the bottom 10 on both categories as well. Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Vermont and Idaho are among the other small states that rank relatively low in both categories too.

Minorities have less representation in Senate

David Shor, a senior analyst at Civis Analytics, a Democratic-oriented data consulting firm, has quantified how the Senate has increasingly diluted the electoral impact of minority voters over time. Using a statistical technique that compares the minority share of the population in each state to the minority share of the nation's overall population, he found that minority voters are more underrepresented in the Senate today than at any point since 1870. Projections by Robert Griffin of the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute show that minority underrepresentation is on track to widen further for at least the next 40 years as the nation grows more diverse.

The reason for this growing gap, Shor explains, is that the minority population, particularly immigrants and their children, are concentrating in the largest states already disadvantaged by the Senate's structure, while the predominantly white and smaller states that gain under the rules are diversifying much more slowly. "The issue at a high level is that most growth in the nonwhite population has been concentrated in large states like California, New York and Florida," Shor says.

That means the racial implications of the Senate's small state bias will only grow as the US continues its transition into a majority nonwhite nation through the next quarter century or so. Because that growing nonwhite population is concentrated in relatively fewer states, their influence in the Senate will be enduringly constrained. "The Senate is the last redoubt of white voting power," Shor says. "You have a small group of white rural states ... that are going to have an enormous amount of power, not just over judges, but over vetoing legislation."

Beyond race, other factors are separating the large and small states. The small states tend to be more rural (albeit with some notable exceptions, such as heavily urbanized Rhode Island, Nevada and Delaware), according to census figures analyzed by The Daily Yonder, a website that focuses on rural issues. Smaller states, with very few exceptions, tend to rank lower in the share of their jobs that require a high level of digital skill, a key measure of engagement with the information economy, according to analysis by the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. And even as white Christians have fallen to just over two-fifths of the nation's population, they remain a considerably larger share in many of the smaller states, such as West Virginia, South and North Dakota, Maine, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas and Idaho, according to surveys by the PRRI.

Small state advantage extends through US government

All these dynamics now intertwine to produce a Senate that is structurally tilted to advantage the portions of America least touched by -- and in many ways most hostile to -- the big social and economic changes remaking American society. Because of the Senate's role in determining Electoral College votes and confirming justices, its bias toward those states reverberates through those dimensions of political power as well.

"The fact that the racial divide is so deep between the parties, and the urban-rural divide is so deep between the parties, overlaps in problematic ways with the bias in Senate representation," says Lee. "And that bias in Senate representation is also reflected in the Electoral College and in the composition of the court because it is the Senate's job to confirm nominations. So it's all linked."

James Madison, the Constitution's principal architect, bitterly opposed equal representation for every state in the Senate; the dispute over population-based versus equal Senate representation proved the most difficult for the framers to resolve. (As Lee notes, equal representation in the Senate was decided only on a 5-4 vote of the states, with Massachusetts' delegation divided, on July 16, 1787.)

Madison viewed equal Senate representation as unfair to voters in the largest states, but even he did not imagine that small and large states would consistently diverge in so many ways -- not only in their political preference but also in their social and economic structure. As Lee and her co-author, Bruce Oppenheimer, recount in "Sizing Up the Senate," Madison tried to assuage small state fears by noting that the era's largest states -- Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania -- were wildly different in their religions, manners and agricultural economies.

"Was a Combination to be apprehended from the mere circumstance of equality of size?" Madison insisted. "Experience suggested no such danger."

Even today, "equality of size" doesn't ensure that states lean the same way politically. But that sorting by size seems likely to accelerate as Democratic-leaning minority groups and whites working in the information economy concentrate in the largest states, and Republicans grow more dominant among blue-collar, older, rural and religious whites who predominate in smaller states. Over time, that could enlarge the number of voices, like Shor, openly questioning whether the elements of the American political structure that advantage small states -- the Electoral College and the two-senators-per-state rule -- are systematically benefiting the groups and regions that embody America's past over those forging its future.

"We have an electoral system that is structurally biased against this coalition at every level of government," he frets.

Those complaints, for now, remain at the edge of political debate. But given the intense polarization of modern American politics, it's not difficult to imagine that changing sooner rather than later. For instance, if Trump lost the popular vote again in 2020 yet squeezed out a second Electoral College win, that institution would surely face more intense scrutiny. More immediately, a confirmation battle in which a Republican Senate coalition rooted in smaller, mostly white states enshrines a lasting Supreme Court majority over the objections of a Democratic coalition centered in larger, more diverse states could also provoke more questions about the Senate's imbalances.

"The pressures are latent but it's not yet manifest in our politics," Lee says. "The thing to watch for is the extent to which politicians begin to question the fairness of the system. You need to see more of that before the system's legitimacy is in peril."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Embattled Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter has agreed to step down from his congressional committee assignments, a Republican leadership aide tells CNN.

The news came after the California lawmaker pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges that he and his wife, Margaret, misused a quarter million dollars in campaign funds for personal expenses. Some of the personal spending includes a lavish Italian vacation as well as fast food and fine dining establishment trips.

Hunter and his wife were named in an indictment made public on Tuesday.

The congressman told a San Diego TV station that the charges were politically motivated, saying the Justice Department has become the law enforcement arm of the Democratic Party and that liberal leaning prosecutors were targeting him in the same way they have President Donald Trump.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement on Tuesday after the allegations were made public that the charges against Hunter were "deeply serious" and had said that he would be removed from his committee assignments "pending the resolution of this matter."

__label__world (CNN) The death of a 23-year-old student, who killed herself two months after she alleged she was raped has renewed anger over sexual violence against women in South Africa.

Khensani Maseko, a student at the Rhodes University in Grahamstown, said she was raped by another student in May, according to a statement by the university.

On August 3, the day she took her own life, Maseko posted a cryptic message on social media.

"No one deserves to be raped," she wrote and posted on Instagram with a picture showing what is believed to be her date of birth and that day's date.

Maseko's account has since been removed from Instagram.

Rhodes University confirmed her death and said authorities held a meeting with Maseko's parents after she reported in July that she had been raped.

The university says it was agreed that Maseko should be taken home pending an investigation into her allegations.

The third-year student died a few days before her scheduled return to the university, where she was to meet with those investigating the case at the institution.

The man accused of the rape has been suspended, the university said in the statement posted on its website , adding that it was working with South Africa's police and the National Prosecuting Authority to launch an inquest into Maseko's death.

Police have not released the suspect's name.

"The tragic passing of Khensani will not mark an end to the investigation into the circumstances leading up to her passing," Rhodes University Vice-Chancellor Dr. Sizwe Mabizela said.

The university's flag will be flown at half-staff to honor Maseko, Mabizela added.

There was a mass outpouring of grief from friends, family and the university community as the student was laid to rest in Johannesburg Thursday.

Maseko's mother in an emotional tribute to her daughter, said her death has left a "gaping and bleeding hole" in her heart, local media reported.

"Khensi‚ your tragic passing left a gaping and bleeding hole in my heart. You were my pride and joy from the moment I held you for the first time. I loved you with every fibre in me‚" Thembi Thobile Maseko said at the funeral.

"You were my child and yet my little sister I never had. We had a wonderful life together. We shared the highs and the lows."

Women killed at higher rate

Statistics show sexual violence against women is a serious problem in South Africa.

According to estimates released in June by the national statistical service of South Africa, 138 out of every 100,000 women in the country were raped in 2016 and 2017.

"This figure is among the highest in the world. For this reason, some have labeled South Africa the 'rape capital of the world,'" it said.

By comparison, the 2015 figures for the number of rapes in Switzerland was 6.4 cases per 100,000 women.

Also, the country's rate of femicide — the killing of a woman or a girl because she is female -- is five times more than the global rate

TotalShutDown march

Maseko's death has sparked public outrage in South Africa, where women often use social media to share images of women who have been killed by their partners.

South African women protest against gender abuse in Cape Town, South Africa on August 1, 2018.

The TotalShutDown protest was held to unite South African women against the ongoing "war on their bodies," said Loyiso Saliso, a spokeswoman for the movement.

"August is the woman's [month] but women in this country are not happy. We have nothing to feel, we have nothing to celebrate. The issue of gender-based violence has only been getting worse rather than better and that is very visible in our statistics as well," she said.

The women marched to South Africa's Parliament, Supreme Court of Appeal and other provincial and regional structures to hand over a memorandum of demands to the government.

"When perpetrators are more afraid of the consequences they are going to face once they violate women, we will start seeing less of women and children disappearing, or being killed," Saliso said.

A priority crime

In May, Sandile Mantsoe was found guilty of the Johannesburg murder of 22-year-old Karabo Mokoena, his ex-girlfriend.

The day he was convicted, a student at Mangosuthu University of Technology in Umlazi, Zolile Khumalo, was allegedly shot and killed by her boyfriend.

In many cases of violence against women, partners are involved in the crime, but South African women are also victims of random rapes and killings.

South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma declared violence against women "a priority crime" after a string of killings that shocked the country in 2016.

He called on law enforcement agencies in the country to ensure all perpetrators of sexual violence were brought to justice.

Renewed fears

But Maseko's death has reignited fears over sexual violence in the country.

Star Khulu, 28, told CNN she tries to make herself look less attractive anytime she leaves her home in Johannesburg.

She said she believes dressing in a less provocative manner reduces her risk of being sexually assaulted.

As a strategist in an advertising agency, she avoids coming home late from work. Even in the daytime, she takes precautions.

"I detour if I am approaching more than two men at a time. Sometimes you just don't want to hear the catcalling, even if you say hello and move on -- that could be an invitation for more," she said.

Khulu says men have become aggressive in the past when she did not acknowledge their advances.

"A man once grabbed my arm in a supermarket because I didn't look at him and smile when he said I was beautiful. Men grab your bum and don't see anything wrong with it," Khulu said.

"Sometimes, I just smile at them to avoid trouble. I try everything, every day not to get raped," she said.

__label__politics Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

Except these dramatic developments, as alarming as they should be to British citizens, businesses and politicians, have emerged in a series of 25 incredibly technical documents covering finance, farming, medicine and even imported sperm donation.

The British love dry, bureaucratic technical reports as much as they love queuing. Which is to say, they love it a lot.

May's government has been under pressure to reveal its contingency plans for what will happen to the country's infrastructure, mass transit, health care and trade if her ministers cannot broker a deal with Brussels.

Britain is leaving the European Union in seven months, and yet more than two years on from its public vote for Brexit, a deal has not yet been reached.

Talks have been slow, held back by political wrangling among May's own senior ministers. The Prime Minister's latest vision for an exit strategy, known as the Chequers plan, is opposed by large parts of her own Conservative Party, as well as negotiators in Brussels.

In reality, the deadline for a Brexit deal is far sooner than March, because a deal is supposed to be struck by October so it can be ratified by Britain's parliament, as well as legislatures in other EU countries. As such, the prospect of a no-deal scenario grows more likely by the day.

In theory, then, British politics should be as dramatic as the events that are unfolding in the US and Australia. Brexit -- and the apocalyptic worst-case scenarios as set out under a no deal -- should be one of the most significant pieces of political theater the UK has witnessed in years.

The EU mantras of clocks ticking and "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" should be electrifying the body politic in the UK. In reality, Brexit has become stultifying and technocratic.

But is this deliberate? Dominic Raab, who has been in his job as Brexit Secretary for a matter of weeks, unveiled the no-deal planning papers in a speech in London on Thursday morning. The content of his speech was technical and sober, his delivery studiously dry and calm. He spoke of "managing and mitigating the risks." There was only one line that gave a hint of drama, when the minister said: "Amidst all of the technical detail we understand that real livelihoods are at stake here."

Yet, as many observers pointed out on Twitter, Raab was sweating profusely -- no doubt as a result of the atmospherics in the room, but the contrast served as a reminder of the disconnect between the newly published papers and what many see as the very real and alarming prospect of chaos if a no-deal Brexit does take place.

The UK government is having to walk a very fine line: if it engages in alarmist language, it will be accused by pro-Brexit politicians and commentators of trying to create panic and "project fear," and prevent what those Brexiteers really want, which is a much harder Brexit than the Chequers plan envisages, with all trade and customs links to the EU severed.

Yet if the government does not entertain the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal, with all of the associated complexities and logistical problems that entails, there will be public outcry if that no-deal scenario comes to pass.

British businesses, in particular, have been calling for no-deal contingency planning from May's government for at least a year. They are alarmed that it has taken until now, with seven months to go before Brexit Day, for that planning to be published.

Politicians and civil servants are still haunted by events of 18 years ago next month, when what started off as an apparently innocuous, small-scale protest by UK farmers over the rising cost of fuel turned into a full-blown crisis within a matter of days when an oil refinery was blockaded, gas pumps ran dry across the country, supermarket shelves were emptied by panicking citizens and hospital operations were canceled.

The Labour government of the time, taken by surprise, nearly fell. It was a sign of how Britain, a country famous for its queuing and stable but dull bureaucracy, tipped into panic-buying and chaos in the space of 72 hours. That is the no-deal Brexit dilemma facing May's government right now.
__label__politics (CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Gotcha by Tom Scott from the television show "Starsky and Hutch."

Poll of the week: A new A new Marist College poll finds that 20% of Americans rate President Donald Trump's job performance as excellent, 20% as pretty good, 13% as only fair and 45% as poor.

There is, not surprisingly, a large gap between how members of the two parties view Trump. Although only 2% of Democrats say Trump is doing an excellent job, 49% of Republicans do. Democrats are far more likely to give a poor rating at 80% compared to 6% of Republicans.

What's the big idea: Trump has, throughout his first term, maintained a low but fairly steady approval rating. He's also had a high disapproval rating. Because Trump's ratings have remained in stasis relative to other presidents, a number have "caught up" to Trump's unpopularity at this point in their presidency. Put another way: Trump is no longer clearly the least popular president at this point in his presidency.

What still makes Trump unique though is the amount of intensity his detractors have for him. You might say many strongly dislike him. The excellent, pretty good, only fair and poor scale allows us to get at that because it's been asked for every president since President John Kennedy.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A growing number of Hispanics along the Texas-Mexico border with birth records showing they were born in the United States are being denied American passports, held in immigration detention centers, and entered into deportation proceedings, immigration attorneys and individuals affected told the Washington Post.

According to the Post report, the issue stems from a government allegation that from the 1950s through the 1990s, midwives and physicians working along the border issued American birth certificates to babies born in Mexico, which some birth attendants have admitted to in court.

The State Department, the Post said, denies changing its "policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport applications." The agency also said the border region "happens to be an area of the country where there has been a significant incidence of citizenship fraud."

But immigration attorneys and cases identified by the Post suggest a "dramatic" change in passports issued and how immigration laws are enforced.

Though scrutiny of these individuals' citizenship began during the George W. Bush administration and continued into the Obama administration, the passport denials came mostly came to an end around 2009 following a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union. But the denials have seen a dramatic uptick since the start of the Trump administration, immigration attorneys told the Post.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The continuing furor over President Donald Trump's Helsinki press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin is focusing a spotlight on a figure meant to be invisible in high-stakes diplomacy: the translator.

Little is known about Gross, a State Department employee with years of experience translating at the highest levels. She has been photographed alongside former first lady Laura Bush. Gross also sat alongside former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his April 2017 visit to Moscow.

Former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul lobbed some public praise Gross' way in a tweet noting that, apart from National Security Council senior director Fiona Hill, Gross was the only other woman in the room. "Our translator, who by the way, is absolutely fantastic!" McFaul tweeted on July 16.

Fiona Hill is the only woman in the meeting (besides our translator, who by the way, is absolutely fantastic !) https://t.co/XggcLxP6bz

No precedent

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Wednesday the department hasn't received a formal request for Gross to appear before any congressional committees yet. Another State Department official said Gross is a longtime and respected civil servant.

John Beyrle, another former US ambassador to Russia, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, "I know the interpreter ... she's a professional."

Translators aren't meant to be pulled into the public fray. They are not confirmed officials or policymakers, and they don't serve the same function as a transcriber or official note takers, the aides who sit alongside a president, secretary of state, or other Cabinet official and record what happened, what promises were made and what requests were lodged.

Gross might have notes of her meeting, but they would have been used to help her translate simultaneously and not maintain a record of Trump's exchanges with Putin. It is highly unusual for lawmakers to ask a translator to appear, let alone one who has been working with a president.

Gamal Helal, an Arabic interpreter and senior adviser to four presidents and seven secretaries of state said that, at least in his memory, there is no precedent for Congress to order a translator to appear.

There have been several instances where translators have been subpoenaed in legal cases, he said, and the State Department — which provides translation services for the entire government — and the Justice Department have protected them from testifying. Often it is a condition of them taking the job, Helal said.

"It would be a horrible precedent if a president wasn't free to talk one-on-one with a head of state," Helal said. "He uses the translator to communicate because he cannot do so in a certain language. If he spoke in English, there would be no other way for Congress to know what he said, except to ask the president himself. Or Putin."

"The principal uses the interpreter to communicate," Helal told CNN. "Therefore the interpreter is an extension of the principal. If you want to know what the principal says, in this case the president, you have to ask him."

Helal says the interpreter can often be a note taker in a one-on-one situation as well, but only at the request of the principal.

"When we are interpreting, we take notes for ourselves - these are not verbatim notes, they are only a language we understand, so we can reconstruct the phrase or paragraph," Helal says.

"Sometimes you prepare the notes at the request of the president," Helal added. "Once you have the notes, you give them to the president and he does what he wants with it. It is not up to the interpreter to reveal what he says. Only the principal has the right and privilege to control the fate of those notes."

The White House said that Trump requested alone time with Putin to better assess him and develop a leader-to-leader relationship. Trump has previously expressed anger at leaks coming from his meetings with foreign leaders and told aides he didn't want sensitive information leaking from his meeting with Putin.

Trump also didn't want aides, who may take a harder line on Russia, undercutting or interrupting him in his conversation with Putin, officials told CNN.

Beyrle said that State Department translators "keep notes and keep a record" and that he was sure that by now Gross has been debriefed by national security adviser John Bolton and Hill or the NSC. "I'm sure we have a pretty good sense of what happened in that meeting," Beyrle said.

Lawmakers want to know what Trump and Putin discussed

But lawmakers don't have a sense of what happened.

Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that his committee was looking into calling Gross to testify , but acknowledged that it is tricky territory. Lawmakers are wrestling with the precedent of having a translator appear before Congress and whether it is appropriate to ask for her notes, Corker said.

There's also the question of whether what the translator heard is covered by executive privilege, which allows the President to fight requests by Congress or the courts for information.

"Look, all of us want to know what took place in this meeting," Corker said. "We're looking into precedent there. We want to make sure...are they are going to call executive privilege? These are notes taken by translators, you understand, in a meeting. I'm not sure it's even appropriate. We're checking that, if it is, certainly we'll pursue it."

"I can understand the request," Corker added.

The impetus to call Gross to testify began with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire. "I'm calling for a hearing with the U.S. interpreter who was present during President Trump's meeting with Putin to uncover what they discussed privately. This interpreter can help determine what @POTUS shared/promised Putin on our behalf," Shaheen tweeted Tuesday.

Rep. Joe Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is also calling for Gross' testimony, told CNN that lawmakers can see that the issue is complicated. "The legal aspects of this are challenging," Kennedy said.

Referring to the President's claim that he believes US intelligence agencies over Putin when it comes to Russian meddling -- a claim Trump immediately undercut by suggesting "other people" might also be responsible -- Kennedy said, "This is a horrible thing to say, the President of the United States has no credibility when it comes to this issue."

"This is a serious national security issue and all that I'm asking for is that we understand what the President agreed to. And we should try to find a way to figure it out" Kennedy said.

But it's unclear if Republicans, who control the witness list for committees on Capitol Hill, would ask the interpreter to testify. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told CNN that he thinks "it's highly unlikely and, frankly, I'm not sure what that accomplishes. The translator is somebody who, one, is probably not versed in the policy and is going to be able to explain the nuances of what went on there."

Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, wants access to the translator's notes, but says it should be done in a classified setting, not a public hearing.

"There are typically notes that are taken. I'm assuming that some of the information could only be given in a classified setting so I would think that before the relevant committees, I'm not saying it ought to be done in a public hearing, we at least ought to get access to the notes that the translators keep, " Flake said.
__label__politics Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) Prosecutors accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of being a "shrewd" liar who orchestrated a global scheme to avoid paying taxes on millions of dollars, in opening statements that kicked off Manafort's trial on Tuesday.

Manafort lived an "extravagant lifestyle" fueled by "secret income" that he earned from his lobbying in Ukraine, said Uzo Asonye, a prosecutor working on the case with special counsel Robert Mueller's team. Manafort became wealthy from the "cash spigot" that came from working for his "golden goose in Ukraine," former President Viktor Yanukovych, Asonye said.

The opening statement indicated that prosecutors plan to put Manafort's wealth on trial as a key element of their case, arguing he funded his lavish spending habits by breaking the law.

"All of these charges boil down to one simple issue: that Paul Manafort lied," Asonye said. "Manafort placed himself and his money over the law."

The case against Manafort outlined by prosecutors on Tuesday represents a new phase in Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling -- the first jury trial stemming from the probe that President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked as a "witch hunt."

Following opening statements, Tad Devine, the Democratic political consultant who worked with Manafort in Ukraine, took the stand as the first witness called in the case. Devine was the chief strategist for the 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Defense strategy

Manafort arrived at the Alexandria courthouse Tuesday morning wearing a black suit, with his hair neatly parted. He's facing 18 charges, including accusations of filing false tax returns, failing to report foreign bank accounts and defrauding several banks. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 305 years in prison. He has denied all charges. In addition to the Virginia case, Manafort faces lobbying-related charges in Washington.

For the defense, Manafort attorney Thomas Zehnle made clear the plan is to point the finger at Manafort's longtime deputy Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and lying to federal investigators in February. Gates was charged with several crimes in the Virginia case, but after his plea, those charges were dropped.

Manafort's "trust in Rick Gates was misplaced," Zehnle said. Gates changed his story over time -- to the point of saying anything to the government, Zehnle argued. And Gates found himself in legal trouble "because he embezzled millions of dollars from his longtime employer," Zehnle said, meaning Manafort.

Tuesday's opening statement was the first time Manafort's team has revealed its strategy in full. It's a bold move, especially given that Gates could also be a key witness in other parts of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

The defense also intends to use witnesses the prosecutors plan to call to substantiate their charge that it was Gates who lied and stole money.

"He had his hand in the cookie jar," Zehnle said of Gates.

Zehnle also shifted much of the blame to the Ukrainian oligarchs Manafort worked for and the business associates he worked with.

"This is the way that they required it to be done," Zehnle said, arguing why oligarchs had paid Manafort through secret foreign accounts. Prosecutors said Tuesday that Manafort had hid 30 foreign bank accounts from US authorities.

Manafort reacted differently to the prosecutors' opening statements than to those of his own attorney. As Asonye spoke for 30 minutes, Manafort stared down at the table with his glasses on. He removed his glasses and looked intently at his defense attorney when it was Zehnle's turn.

Manafort sat looking at his papers on the desk in front of him as Asonye called him a liar. His wife, Kathleen, seated behind him, sat stoically, looking at the floor as the prosecutor attacked her husband.

Luxurious spending habits and a 'star witness'

Asonye used some dramatic flair in his opening statement.

"A man in this courtroom believed the law did not apply to him," he began, facing jurors and with his back to Manafort.

To demonstrate Manafort's lavish spending habits, Asonye told jurors that Manafort owned several homes, acquired real estate in New York and Virginia, bought expensive cars and a $21,000 watch, and even got a $15,000 jacket "made from an ostrich."

He described how Manafort allegedly made $60 million in Ukraine that he didn't report to the federal government, then used his own 30 bank accounts in three foreign countries to create sham loans and collect untaxed income he spent on the luxury goods.

Asonye walked jurors through a simple narrative trying to boil down complex instruments like offshore shell companies that the government says Manafort used to hide millions of dollars in payments received from Ukrainian oligarchs.

He urged jurors to "just follow the money."

As he started delivering his opening statement, Asonye earned a rebuke from Judge T.S. Ellis, who told him not to tell jurors that "the evidence will show" that the allegations against Manafort are true.

In his opening statement, Zehnle called out prosecutors for barely mentioning Gates and noted that he is the government's "star witness," who had pleaded guilty to lying to the government.

Manafort never intended to deceive the IRS or anyone else, Zehnle argued. In 2014, Manafort voluntarily sat down with the FBI and told them he had been paid $27 million for his work in Ukraine, Zehnle said, and identified the offshore accounts he says he was required to use to do business with Ukrainians.

Manafort's attorney also described how two accountants from the firm Kositzka, Wicks and Co., Philip Ayliff and Cindy Laporta, will say they received false information from Gates about Manafort's accounts. Ayliff and Laporta are among the five witnesses to receive immunity in exchange for their testimony.

Zehnle said Devine would testify about their work together in Europe. Though he didn't mention Russia or the ties to that government Manafort's Ukrainian clients have, Zehnle told the jury Manafort hoped to bring Ukraine closer to Western European democracies through his lobbying work.

Manafort "could not possibly anticipate his work in Ukraine would bring him to this courtroom today," Zehnle said.

The statement was the closest either side stepped during their opening statements toward the foreign politics and focus on Russia that set off Mueller's investigation.

First witness takes the stand

In his testimony, Devine described the organization of Manafort's foreign political consulting operation and how it included Manafort, Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

Devine testified extensively on how much work Manafort did in Ukraine alongside Gates and Kilimnik. He spoke about an effort for Manafort to work with other Ukrainian politicians, besides Yanukovych, as recently as 2014.

Following the defense's questioning, prosecutor Greg Andres asked Devine, "Did you ever set up an account" in Cyprus "to receive money from Ukrainian politicians?" Devine said no.

Prosecutors tried to prevent Manafort's team from asking Devine if he and Manafort worked for opposing political parties in the US. The jury never heard it, but Devine has worked for Democrats, including Sanders, while Manafort has spent his career working for Republican candidates.

The trial will resume on Wednesday morning with prosecutors planning to call Daniel Rabin, a Democratic political consultant who worked on Ukrainian campaigns.

Tuesday's opening statements and testimony came after the jury was also selected and sworn in on Tuesday. The 12-person jury comprises six men and six women. There are also four alternates, three women and a man.

Ellis had given the pool of 65 potential jurors an overview of the charges against Manafort, though he reminded the group that the indictment "is not evidence of any guilt whatsoever."

The pool was also nearly evenly split between men and women. The group was predominantly white, with fewer than a dozen nonwhite potential jurors. Most were comfortably middle-aged.
__label__politics (CNN) Democratic nominee for Florida governor Andrew Gillum isn't worried about the possible influence President Donald Trump will have on his race against Republican Ron DeSantis in the general election this November.

"I actually believe that Florida and its rich diversity are going to be looking for a governor who's going to bring us together, not divide us. Not misogynist, not racist, not bigots," Gillum told CNN's John Berman on "New Day" Wednesday morning, following his primary victory Tuesday night.

He added, "They're going to be looking for a governor who is going to appeal to our higher aspirations as a state. Who's going to talk about what it means to build a Florida that makes room for all of us and not just some of us."

Gillum made history Tuesday night as the first black candidate to win a major-party gubernatorial nomination in Florida. His surprise upset win Tuesday night was also a major victory for the Democratic Party's progressive wing.

The race pits Gillum, a Bernie Sanders-backed progressive candidate, against DeSantis, who has Trump's endorsement, in what is a major test of the political atmosphere. On Tuesday, after clinching the GOP nomination, DeSantis credited the President for helping boost his candidacy.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday accused Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of undermining the US and its allies with comments he made at the G7 summit.

"It was a betrayal," Kudlow said on CNN's "State of the Union."

Kudlow was speaking following the G7 summit in Canada on Saturday. As Trump flew from the summit with US allies to a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, he lashed out at Trudeau for what he said were his "false statements" at a news conference and said the US would not endorse the G7 communique, a negotiated statement on shared priorities among the group.

Although it is unclear which of Trudeau's statements Trump was calling false, Trudeau said in the news conference Saturday that Canada will "move forward with retaliatory measures" on July 1 in response to the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico.

"I have made it very clear to the President that it is not something we relish doing, but it something that we absolutely will do," Trudeau said. "Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around."

In his interview Sunday, Kudlow accused Trudeau of making his comments for "domestic political consumption" and doing "a great disservice to the whole G7."

"He really kind of stabbed us in the back," Kudlow said.

Kudlow said the US had spent the summit negotiating in "good faith" with Trudeau and the other assembled leaders, and that the US had planned to sign the communique until Trudeau's news conference, which Kudlow called a "sophomoric play."

Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser, directed a series of stinging comments at Trudeau on "Fox News Sunday."

"There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," Navarro said. "And that's what bad faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference. That's what weak, dishonest Justin Trudeau did, and that comes right from Air Force One."

Navarro added that while these were his own words, they reflected the "the sentiment that was on Air Force One." Navarro also said Trump attending the G7 in Canada was a "courtesy" to Trudeau and that the President had "bigger things on his plate" in Singapore.

"He did him a favor," Navarro said. "He was even willing to sign that socialist communique."

Asked about the scathing comments from Trump's advisers on Sunday, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland called Trump's tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel "illegal and unjustified" and said Canada does not believe in using "ad hominem attacks" on the international stage.

"Canada does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks," Freeland said. "We don't think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, and perhaps we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes to our relationship with our allies."

Kudlow: Partially about North Korea

Kudlow also said Trump's planned meeting with Kim was part of the reason why they were taking such issue with Trudeau's comments and that Trump was "not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around" ahead of the North Korea summit.

"He is not going to permit any show of weakness on the trip to negotiate with North Korea," Kudlow said.

Kudlow said allies should have been more supportive of Trump given the meeting with Kim, using the words "crazy nuclear tyrant" in reference to the North Korean leader.

"They should have said to him, 'God speed, you are negotiating with the crazy nuclear tyrant in North Korea, and we are behind you,'" Kudlow said.

Trump, en route to Singapore, called Trudeau's news conference "very dishonest & weak" following his tweet ahead of the G7 summit calling Trudeau "indignant."

In response to Trump's tweets on Saturday, Trudeau's office contended that the Canadian leader said nothing he had not said previously "both in public and in private conversations" with Trump.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said Trump's decision on the G7 communique was "actually not a real surprise" and cited Trump's previous decisions to remove the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.

"In a matter of seconds, you can destroy trust with 280 Twitter characters," the German foreign minister added.

Criticism from senators

Trump's decision not to endorse the G7 communique brought pushback from some in the US, including Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who broke with Trump on Twitter.

"To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values," McCain wrote. "Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn't."

Asked about the criticism from McCain, Kudlow said Trump had spent much of the summit advocating trade policies McCain would support.

"President Trump is essentially doing what John McCain wanted him to do with respect to free trade," Kudlow said. "President Trump made it clear, time and again, in those two days outside of Quebec that he wants to reinstitute a process of free trade, no tariffs, no tariff barriers, no quotas and subsidies."

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in a separate interview on the same CNN program, called Trump's decision not to sign the communique a "big mistake" that distanced the US from its top allies.

"I understand the President was upset," Feinstein said. "The President could have said that, but to walk away from our allies in this way, I think, is a mistake."
__label__politics CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin reacts to Michael Cohen pleading guilty to eight criminal counts and saying, in part, that he did so "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office."
__label__politics (CNN) After President Donald Trump's stunning news conference Monday next to Russian President Vladimir Putin , members of Congress -- including some powerful Republicans -- were quick to rebuke Trump's performance on the world stage and Trump's refusal to call Putin out for interfering in the US election.

House Speaker Paul Ryan contradicted several comments Trump made during his Helsinki news conference, most notably backing the US intelligence community assessment that Russia meddled with the US 2016 presidential election.

"There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world," said Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, in a statement. "That is not just the finding of the American intelligence community but also the House Committee on Intelligence."

Ryan continued, "The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally. There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals. The United States must be focused on holding Russia accountable and putting an end to its vile attacks on democracy."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke briefly with reporters Monday, giving his support to the US intelligence community.

"I've said a number of times and I say it again, the Russians are not our friends and I entirely believe the assessment of our intelligence community," the Kentucky Republican said. He did not answer a question on whether he would tell Trump that he disagreed with him.

Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who has consistently criticized the President, said Trump's comments were "one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory."

Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker said the President "made us look like a pushover" and that Putin was probably eating caviar on the plane home.

"I was very disappointed and saddened with the equivalency that he gave between them (the US intelligence agencies) and what Putin was saying," said Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is not seeking re-election.

Trump's comments that appeared to equivocate Putin's denial of Russian election meddling and the US intelligence community's assessment were commonly evoked in the steady stream of criticism. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, issued a blistering statement just minutes after the press conference wrapped.

Sasse rebuked Trump's statement that he held "both countries responsible" for the deteriorated relationship between the United States and Russia.

"This is bizarre and flat-out wrong. The United States is not to blame. America wants a good relationship with the Russian people but Vladimir Putin and his thugs are responsible for Soviet-style aggression," Sasse said in the statement. "When the President plays these moral equivalence games, he gives Putin a propaganda win he desperately needs."

Some Republicans 'deeply troubled' by Trump

Some Republicans in both the House and Senate -- even some typically seen as allies to the President -- said in the hours following the news conference that they were concerned over what they heard Monday.

"The President's summit in Helsinki today should have been an attempt at confronting Russian aggression, hacking, and election interference," Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said in a tweet. "Russia is not a friend or ally. As Americans, we stand up for our interests and values abroad; but I fear today was a step backwards."

"As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am deeply troubled by President Trump's defense of Putin against the intelligence agencies of the U.S. & his suggestion of moral equivalence between the U.S. and Russia. Russia poses a grave threat to our national security," tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who was among the Republicans leading last week's sharply partisan hearing of FBI agent Peter Strzok, made clear Monday he did not see Russia as a US ally.

"I am confident former CIA Director and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, DNI Dan Coats, Ambassador Nikki Haley, FBI Director Chris Wray, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others will be able to communicate to the President it is possible to conclude Russia interfered with our election in 2016 without delegitimizing his electoral success," Gowdy said in a statement.

Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said she sharply disagreed with Trump's comments.

"It's certainly not helpful for the President to express doubt about the conclusions of his own team," Collins told reporters. "He has assembled a first-rate intelligence team handled by Dan Coats and I would hope that he would take their analysis over the predictable denials of President Putin."

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has had a close working relationship with Trump on issues related to health care and tax reform, tweeted that the summit was a "missed opportunity."

"Missed opportunity by President Trump to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling and deliver a strong warning regarding future elections," Graham tweeted. "This answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves."

Graham also warned Trump to leave a soccer ball, a gift from Putin, outside of the White House.

"If it were me, I'd check the soccer ball for listening devices and never allow it in the White House," Graham said.

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who has been constant critic, called the President's performance "shameful."

"I never thought I would see the day when our American President would stand on the stage with the Russian President and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression. This is shameful," tweeted Flake, who is not running for re-election.

Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican and former undercover CIA officer, expressed shock at Trump's attitude towards Putin and Russia.

"I've seen the Russian intelligence manipulate many people many people in my career, and I never would have thought the US President would be one of them," Hurd said on CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper."

Republicans show support for US intelligence community

Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger called Trump's comments rebuking the US intelligence community assessment "a disservice," though he did not mention Trump by name.

"The American people deserve the truth, & to disregard the legitimacy of our intelligence officials is a disservice to the men & women who serve this country. It's time to wake up & face reality. #Putin is not our friend; he's an enemy to our freedom," Kinzinger tweeted.

The responses came after Trump declined to endorse the US intelligence community's finding that the Russians interfered in the 2016 US election.

Instead, Trump said Putin was "extremely strong and powerful" in his denial.

"I have confidence in both parties," Trump said of Russia and the US intelligence community.

"I have real confidence in my intelligence people, but I must tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial," Trump said.

A senior GOP congressional aide told CNN it's "shocking he would disrespect our intel community on foreign soil. Next to Putin."

Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, a key Trump ally, issued a statement backing up the intelligence community, but did not directly criticize the President.

"Russia interfered in the 2016 election," Hatch said in a statement. "Our nation's top intelligence agencies all agree on that point. From the President on down, we must do everything in our power to protect our democracy by securing future elections from foreign influence and interference, regardless of what Vladimir Putin or any other Russian operative says. I trust the good work of our intelligence and law enforcement personnel who have sworn to protect the United States of America from enemies foreign and domestic."

New Jersey Republican Frank LoBiondo, who chairs the House CIA subcommittee, also said Trump missed an opportunity to grill Putin.

"I strongly disagree w/ statement that Russia did not meddle in 2016 election. With all I have seen on House Intel Comm & additional indictments of 12 Russian officers last week, it is clear Russia's intentions. President Trump missed opportunity to hold Putin publicly accountable," tweeted LoBiondo, who is not running for re-election

Democrats outraged

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump "took the word of the KGB over the men and women of the CIA."

He called on Republicans to speak out.

"In the entire history of our country, Americans have never seen a president of the United States support an American adversary the way President Trump has supported President Putin," the New York Democrat said at a news conference.

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, tweeted "for the President to side with Putin over his own intelligence officials and blame the United States for Russia's attack on our democracy is a complete disgrace."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said Trump embarrassed the US.

"Once again, @realDonaldTrump takes to the international stage to embarrass America, undermine our institutions, weaken our alliances, & embrace a dictator. Russia interfered in our elections & attacked our democracy. Putin must be held accountable -- not rewarded. Disgraceful," Warren tweeted.

Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, tweeted that someday the US would "turn the page on this dark chapter," but it would not be easy.

"This is a sad, shameful moment for our great nation. We will reclaim our values and reassert our global leadership. We'll turn the page on this dark chapter. But it won't happen on its own. We all must stand up—to side with U.S. law enforcement and to protect all Americans," Kaine said.

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, called Trump's statements "shocking and dismaying and, in fact, appeasement."

"Donald Trump was a patsy, a pushover and a puppet. Not a President. He, in effect, instead of putting America's interests first, he blamed America first and he blamed everyone except Russia and himself," Blumenthal said on CNN's "The Situation Room."

Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room," Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, also of Connecticut, said that what Trump's actions during the summit really showed is that the President simply "doesn't care."

Himes said that "if the President had been firm ... maybe Putin would have taken a step back," but what instead resulted was "a truly disgraceful performance that puts our national security at deep risk."

"What Putin got from the President was this," Himes said. "There is nothing you can do, nothing you can contemplate so bad, that the most powerful country in the world -- the United States of America -- will call you out on it."

Sen. Chris Murphy's mouth was "still agape" by the time of his appearance on CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" -- namely because it seemed to be a "settled fact" by "everyone in the US who knows what's going on" that the Russians had interfered with the 2016 elections, despite Trump statements at the summit.

"The bar was so low for this press conference," the Connecticut Democrat said. "All Trump needed to do was offer some mild pushback against the election interference, say something about the need for Russia to withdraw from eastern Ukraine and Crimea, and he couldn't do any of that."

He added, "America is a whole lot weaker than we were going into this today."

This story has been updated with additional developments.
__label__politics But they've broken with Trump on a number of issues in the past, including Russia.

They've criticized his baiting of white supremacists after deadly protests in Charlottesville, griped about the trade wars he's trying to start with tariffs, condemned his arguably racist comments about Mexico and other countries and been disgusted by him over the Access Hollywood tapes.

With the exception of Russia -- lawmakers forced sanctions on Trump a year ago -- there's not much Congress has done to rein him in. And many of those Republicans that have advocated more direct opposition to Trump will be out of a job next year.

The outrage at his performance in Helsinki was immediate and nearly unanimous, even among Republicans.

"There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals," said Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who is retiring soon.

Ryan's comment was a direct contradiction of Trump over the issue of Russia attacking the US election that sent Trump to the White House in 2016. Asked if he holds Russia accountable for anything at all during that appearance with Putin, Trump said the US and Russia both bear some blame.

Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, long a Trump critic, called the comment "bizarre and flat-out wrong."

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain called the whole Trump appearance "disgraceful," and so did Utah GOP Senate candidate Mitt Romney, who added that Trump's actions were "detrimental to Democratic principles."

Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, was, as is his style, gentler and careful in his wording when he said that the Russians are "not our friends."

Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Republican in charge of oversight in the House, said he hoped those around Trump would help him see the light.

"I am confident former CIA Director and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, DNI Dan Coats, Ambassador Nikki Haley, FBI Director Chris Wray, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others will be able to communicate to the President it is possible to conclude Russia interfered with our election in 2016 without delegitimizing his electoral success," Gowdy said in a statement.

There you have it. So what's next? Probably not much. As for any long-term rift between Republicans and the White House, lawmakers have already broken with Trump repeatedly during his candidacy and his time in White House and they have always come back home to him.

And there's every indication this lashing out will be as temporary as the others.

Take Gowdy. Days before lining up behind the intelligence community and Justice Department, he was chief inquisitor of Peter Strzok, the disgraced FBI agent who used to work on the Russia investigation and who Republicans argue showed anti-Trump bias.

Granted, Strzok does not look good in exchanging text messages with a colleague and lover. But put those text messages in the hands of a prosecutor like Gowdy, and the conspiracy theories about a "deep state" out to get the President really start to sing.

You cannot completely separate the work Gowdy did on Trump's behalf delegitimizing the Russia investigation last week with his written statement this week expressing frustration about Trump's warmth to Russia.

Those two things are linked.

Or take Romney, whose very public history with Trump has gone from highs, like Trump's very public endorsement of Romney for president in 2012 (he lost, as Trump likes to point out), to Romney's attempt to Brutus his party's likely nominee in 2016. When efforts to sabotage Trump's campaign failed , Romney considered taking up the secretary of state position, but was passed over by Trump.

Now he's running for Senate, but he's not opposing Trump on everything. Far from it.

Romney actually laid out exactly what's happening now in an op-ed in the Salt Lake Tribune earlier this year . He said, basically, he'll oppose Trump when he needs to, criticize him when he wants to, but he won't be forgetting they're on the same team.

"On one hand there are those who believe supporting the Trump agenda means supporting every policy the President proposes, whether or not they actually agree with that policy. It means refraining from criticizing anything the President says or does. The argument for this position is that you pick a team, so to speak, and when the leader of the team is criticized, his or her power to act is weakened and the opposition helped. So in order to achieve Republican policy aims, solid Republicans should stand with the President 100 percent, or at least stay silent when in disagreement.

"I take a different course. I will support the President's policies when I believe they are in the best interest of Utah and the nation."

By Romney's outline, Russia is one of those policy areas where he disagrees with the President. There will be others where he agrees. Tax cuts, perhaps, or Obamacare or the Supreme Court. He's perfectly happy separating these out.

Notably, the loudest voices opposing Trump in the GOP are headed for the exits. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman who has long criticized Trump, wants to clip the President's wings on trade. He unveiled a bill to rein in Trump's power to unilaterally impose tariffs (which Trump has gleefully deployed to tempt trade wars China, the EU, Mexico and Canada).

After Trump's brutalization of NATO last week and his cozying up to Putin this week, Corker called again for a vote on the measure. But McConnell and Ryan, neither of whom are great fans of Trump's tariffs, sound very much like they won't be voting on Corker's more binding proposal any time soon, although after Trump's Russia performance, his usual supporter Sen. Orrin Hatch sounded more open to a law curbing Trump's tariff authority.

Neither Corker nor Hatch will be around next year to push it. He's leaving the Senate rather than face a pro-Trump primary. So is Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, another Trump critic.

Senators did pass this month a non-binding resolution in the Senate asking the President to consult them before using national security as an excuse to invoke new tariffs.

It's another example of Republicans being happy to complain, even publicly, about Trump, but unlikely to do much more than that.

Russia has been the exception to the rule of the bark emanating from the GOP not resulting in any bite.

It was about one year ago that lawmakers sent legislation slapping new sanctions on Russia to Trump's desk, which blocked Trump from easing certain sanctions on Russia. He called it "seriously flawed" for encroaching on his ability to negotiate.

But the administration's implementation included a list of oligarchs literally identical to a list printed earlier in Forbes . That doesn't exactly sound like something they're taking completely seriously.

Republican leaders will have to temper any efforts to rebuke the White House and impose new sanctions on Russia -- which is possible, but would not happen immediately -- with their efforts, like in Romney's case, to work with him on a host of other issues, like immigration, averting a government shutdown and getting Supreme Court nominees seated.

It's also hard to see much big legislation getting through Congress this close to an election year when the Senate is already going to be busy with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and overdue spending bills.

The trend among Republicans running for office has been to embrace Trump, by the way, not oppose him.

Is it possible the public and the Republican base are horrified by Trump's appeasement of Putin? Yes. But that would buck the trend of Republicans coming to terms with Trump as their leader. He delivered them the White House and they hold both houses of Congress, at least until November. If they want to keep either one, they'll need the voters who support Trump to show up and vote.

All of which suggests it will be very interesting to watch Republicans wrestle with turning their public rebukes their President on Russia into any definite action.
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump probably isn't going to be heckled at a restaurant any time soon -- since when he does go out to eat, he usually owns the place.

And he's no stranger to a good old-fashioned boycott, having called for boycotts on media organizations and the NFL and been the subject of boycott campaigns as a candidate

But he's sticking up bigly for Sarah Sanders, his press secretary who was asked to leave a restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, and then tweeted about it.

Trump answered the incivility against Sanders with an incivility of his own, criticizing the restaurant's cleanliness.

"The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders," Donald Trump tweeted. "I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!"

As this episode shows, we seem to be in a moment of degraded discourse. Which should surprise exactly no one in a time when the President uses the the imagery of invaders and infestation to describe immigrants and those who oppose him continue to treat his presidency as post-apocalyptic.

Warlike language is going to get nasty.

Rep. Maxine Waters encouraged members of the Trump opposition to essentially play a little dirty to make life difficult for people who work for the President.

"Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome any more, anywhere. We've got to get the children connected to their parents," Waters said at the Wilshire Federal Building, according to video of the event.

Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Waters' statements "unacceptable," but blamed it all on Trump's lack of civility.

Trump, by the way, fired back at Waters, too, saying on Twitter she was encouraging violence and calling her "low IQ" and shooting back what seemed like an invitation for his own supporters to heckle her. "Be careful what you wish for Max!"

Sanders ignored her own boss' broadside when she opened her briefing with reporters Monday talking about being asked to leave the restaurant and also an attack against first lady Melania Trump by Peter Fonda on Twitter last week.

"Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important, but the calls for harassment and push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable," she said at Monday's press briefing. "America is a great country and our ability to find solutions despite those disagreements is what makes us unique."

A good amount of this tone has sprung from the President's Twitter account. He's encouraged scorched-earth opposition, particularly against the news media.

A large majority thinks civility has taken a trip out of town in the Trump years. Back in November of 2017 a Marist poll asked , "Since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, do you think the overall tone and level of civility in Washington between Republicans and Democrats has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse?" Sixty-seven percent of Americans said it had gotten worse, and that included 60% of Republicans.

And it should be no surprise that as activists and media organizations use ever more intense rhetoric to describe the actions of the President; when families are literally being separated at the border, that civility should be hard to maintain.

And that's why Trump administration officials and staffers, even before Waters' statements, have recently been:

There's obviously a big difference between not being able to get a date and being publicly called out by members of your church. But if there's a sliding scale of incivility, there's space on there for a lot of things.

If you use language of war to describe undocumented immigrants as invaders trying to take over the country, you will likely get a militant response from people who feel very strongly that immigrants are not an invading horde.

A good example of how the sliding scale of incivility can affect a Trump administration official is Vice President Mike Pence.

When he was singled out and lectured in the opening days of the Trump administration by the cast of the Broadway musical Hamilton, that was done mostly respectfully. They were asking him to pay attention to people afraid of the new administration. But those were early days. Pence stayed silent and Trump went after the Hamilton cast on his behalf.

JUST WATCHED Pence leaves NFL game over anthem kneeling Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pence leaves NFL game over anthem kneeling 01:45

Pence was on the other side of the equation when he walked out in disgust from an NFL game due to athletes kneeling for the National Anthem -- that should probably go on the incivility scale too.

And with every Trump tweet and increasingly provocative policy statement that seems designed to divide the electorate, the civility continues to slide.
__label__politics (CNN) Anthony Scaramucci predicted Saturday that President Donald Trump "would have a nightmare on his hands" if he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

"If you were in a business setting, he clearly would have been fired," Scaramucci said of Sessions. However, the former White House communications director told CNN's Ana Cabrera on "CNN Newsroom" that if he were still working there, he would not help Trump fire Sessions.

"No, because he would have a nightmare on his hands in politics. It's very, very different in politics, Ana, than in business," Scaramucci said. "If Jeff Sessions was the general counsel for the Trump Organization, it's a totally different set of personnel decisions than if Jeff Sessions is his Cabinet member, attorney general, has a ton of friends in the Senate."

The President has directed particular ire towards his attorney general this week, saying in an interview Thursday that Sessions "never took control" of the Justice Department. The attorney general issued a rare statement in response, saying, "I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in."

Trump continued his barrage against Sessions with a series of tweets on Friday and Saturday.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not know about a $130,000 payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence, his first public acknowledgment of the scandal surrounding an alleged sexual affair that has plagued him for months.

"No," a terse Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when questioned about his knowledge of the payment, which was made by his private attorney Michael Cohen in the month before the 2016 election.

The one word response broke a months-long public silence from Trump on the matter, though he's fumed about the issue in private and adamantly denied to his associates Daniels' claim he had an affair with her in 2006.

An agitated Trump tried to move quickly on -- "What else?" he asked after responding -- but reporters in the press cabin continued their questioning, asking why Cohen made the payment.

"You'll have to ask Michael Cohen," Trump said. "Michael is my attorney. You'll have to ask Michael."

__label__politics Fort Mill, South Carolina (CNN) Ted Cruz and Donald Trump lashed into each other Saturday, with the Texas senator unloading on Trump's record, temperament and fitness to be commander in chief. Meanwhile, Trump spent much of the day slamming his top GOP rival in a repeated Twitter spree so fierce -- even for a candidate who is notable for taunting and insulting his opponents -- it prompted prominent conservative commentator Mark Levin to publicly tell the real-estate mogul to back off.

The salvos -- exchanged hours before both were scheduled to appear at a tea party event in South Carolina -- mark another escalation between the two leading GOP candidates a little more than two weeks before the first votes are cast in Iowa. For Trump, Levin's criticism was a rebuke from a wing of the Republican Party he needs in order to capture the Iowa caucuses, while Cruz's comments represent his harshest attacks against a rival he once promised to "smother with love."

Speaking to reporters, Cruz said "Donald's record does not match what he says as a candidate." He also aggressively ridiculed Trump's obsession with the latest opinion surveys, saying that Trump's early morning attacks on Twitter come because he is "dismayed" about a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showing a competitive race.

"I imagine it pulled him out of bed this morning and sent him tweeting and tweeting and tweeting," he said. "I think in terms of a commander in chief, we ought to have someone who isn't springing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls."

Cruz referred repeatedly to an interview Trump did with NBC News' Tim Russert 17 years ago , in which he defines his "New York values" as distinct from "Iowa values." Cruz said those values -- pro-abortion rights, including supporting partial birth abortion and pro-gay marriage -- explained Trump's worldview. And he dredged up the former Democrat's donation history to some of the state's leading politicians, including Hillary Clinton.

"Given the fact that for much of his life, Donald was financially supporting those politicians -- writing checks to Hillary Clinton, writing checks to Andrew Cuomo -- it is a fair inference that he supports their policies," Cruz said.

The Texas senator, then asked for some differences on national security between him and Trump, offered that was unaware of what Trump's foreign policy is.

"To be honest, I don't know what Donald's position is," Cruz said.

Complementing Cruz's attack was a tweet sent out by his campaign Saturday morning, embedding the 1999 Russert interview on "Meet the Press."

Levin slams Trump over Twitter rampage

Trump began the morning slamming Cruz in a series of tweets, taking a break to appear at a campaign event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, before resuming his tirade.

"Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so," Trump tweeted shortly before 7 a.m. ET, referring to a lawsuit filed by a Houston man challenging the eligibility of Cruz, who was born in Canada to an American mother, to be president.

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

Then Trump slammed Cruz on not disclosing a Goldman Sachs loan , writing, "Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable" he said.

Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

Trump then referenced a New York Times report from Friday that said Cruz failed to disclose a second loan from Citibank during his 2012 Senate run.

"Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!"

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

Cruz declined to comment on the Times report when asked by a CNN reporter during an appearance in Columbia, South Carolina, on Friday.

Trump, however, wasn't done. A few hours after his first Twitter rant, Trump resumed his assault in the afternoon to call Cruz a "hypocrite," slamming him again on his undisclosed loans and seeking donations from people who support same-sex marriage.

"If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?" he asked.

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

Trump also fired back against Cruz's attacks on New York.

"Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!"

Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

To further his defense of the Big Apple, he tweeted a photo of the destroyed World Trade Center days after 9/11.

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? pic.twitter.com/rYGX9vazku — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

Trump's fury attracted the notice of Levin, a conservative writer, radio host and tea party favorite who took to Facebook Saturday afternoon to tell the GOP front-runner to "either cut the crap" or he "will lose lots and lots of conservatives."

"Put down your computer keyboard for a few hours, think before you tweet, and collect yourself," Levin said in the post. "I am already hearing more and more people getting fed up with the low road you're taking against Cruz, which has obviously intensified this morning."

__label__world Kaitlyn Gaynor is co-author of the study "The influence of human disturbance on wildlife nocturnality," published in Science. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.

(CNN) For their first 100 million years on planet Earth, our mammal ancestors relied on the cover of darkness to escape their dinosaur predators and competitors. Only after the meteor-induced mass extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago could these nocturnal mammals explore the many wondrous opportunities available in the light of day.

Fast forward to the present, and the honeymoon in the sun may be over for mammals. They're increasingly returning to the protection of night to avoid the Earth's current terrifying super-predator: Homo sapiens.

My colleagues and I have made the first effort to measure the global effects of human disturbance on the daily activity patterns of wildlife. In our new study in the journal Science, we documented a powerful and widespread process by which mammals alter their behavior alongside people: Human disturbance is creating a more nocturnal natural world.

Many catastrophic effects of humans on wildlife communities have been well-documented: We are responsible for habitat destruction and overexploitation that have imperiled animal populations around the world. However, just our presence alone can have important behavioral impacts on wildlife, even if these effects aren't immediately apparent or easy to quantify. Many animals fear humans: We can be large, noisy, novel and dangerous. Animals often go out of their way to avoid encountering us. But it's becoming more and more challenging for wildlife to seek out human-free spaces, as the human population grows and our footprint expands across the planet.

Global increase in nocturnality

My collaborators and I noticed a striking pattern in some of our own data from research in Tanzania, Nepal and Canada: animals from impala to tigers to grizzly bears seemed to be more active at night when they were around people. Once the idea was on our radar, we began to see it throughout the published scientific literature.

It appeared to be a common global phenomenon; we set out to see just how widespread this effect was. Might animals all over the world be adjusting their daily activity patterns to avoid humans in time, given that it is becoming harder to avoid us in space?

To explore this question, we conducted a meta-analysis , or a study of studies. We systematically scoured the published literature for peer-reviewed journal articles, reports and theses that documented the 24-hour activity patterns of large mammals. We focused on mammals because their need for plenty of space often brings them into contact with humans, and they possess traits that allow for some flexibility in their activity.

We needed to find examples that provided data for areas or seasons of low human disturbance -- that is, more natural conditions -- and high human disturbance. For example, studies compared deer activity in and out of the hunting season, grizzly bear activity in areas with and without hiking, and elephant activity inside protected areas and outside among rural settlement.

Based on reported data from remote camera traps, radio collars or observations, we determined each species' nocturnality, which we defined as the percentage of the animal's total activity that occurred between sunset and sunrise. We then quantified the difference in nocturnality between low and high disturbance to understand how animals changed their activity patterns in response to people.

Overall, for the 62 species in our study, mammals were 1.36 times as nocturnal in response to human disturbance. An animal that naturally split its activity evenly between the day and night, for example, would increase its nighttime activity to 68% around people.

While we expected to find a trend toward increased wildlife nocturnality around people, we were surprised by the consistency of the results around the world. Eighty-three percent of the case studies we examined showed some increase in nocturnal activity in response to disturbance. Our finding was consistent across species, continents and habitat types. Antelope on the savanna of Zimbabwe, tapir in the Ecuadorian rainforests, bobcats in the American southwest deserts -- all seemed to be doing what they could to shift their activity to the cover of darkness.

Perhaps most surprisingly, the pattern also held across different types of human disturbance, including activities such as hunting, hiking, mountain biking, and infrastructure such as roads, residential settlement and agriculture. Animals responded strongly to all activities, regardless of whether people actually posed a direct threat. It seems human presence alone is enough to disrupt their natural patterns of behavior. People may think our outdoor recreation leaves no trace, but our mere presence can have lasting consequences.

Future of human-wildlife coexistence

We don't yet understand the consequences of this dramatic behavioral shift for individual animals or populations. Over millions of years, many of the animals included in our study have evolved adaptations to living in the daylight.

Sun bears retreat from sunny hours near people.

Such diurnally adapted animals may not be as successful at finding food, avoiding predators or communicating in the darkness, which could even reduce their survival or reproduction.

However, because our mammalian ancestors evolved under the cover of darkness in the time of the dinosaurs, most mammal species possess traits that allow for some flexibility in their activity patterns. As long as animals are able to meet their needs during the night, they may actually thrive in human-dominated landscapes by avoiding daytime direct encounters with people that could potentially be dangerous for both parties. In Nepal, for example, tigers and people share the exact same trails in the forest at different times of day, reducing direct conflict between humans and these large carnivores. Dividing up the day, through what researchers call temporal partitioning, may be a mechanism by which people and wildlife can coexist on an ever more crowded planet.

An increase in nocturnality among certain species may also have far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, reshaping species interactions and cascading through food webs. In California's Santa Cruz Mountains, coyotes are becoming more nocturnal in areas with human recreation. By analyzing coyote scat, scientists have linked this behavioral change to dietary shifts from diurnal to nocturnal prey , with implications for small mammal communities and for competition with other predators.

At night, hogs cluster around the watering hole in the Zambezi Region of Namibia.

Working on this study reminded me that people aren't alone on the planet. Even if we don't see large mammals while we're out and about during the day, they may still be living alongside us, asleep while we are awake and vice versa. In areas where threatened species live, managers may consider restricting human activity to certain times of the day, leaving some daylight just for wildlife.

And it is likely that we need to preserve wilderness areas entirely free of human disturbance to conserve the most vulnerable and sensitive mammal species. Not all animals are willing or able to just switch to a nocturnal lifestyle around people. Those that try to avoid human disturbance entirely may be most vulnerable to the consequences of the expanding human footprint.
__label__world (CNN) Relatives of Richard Russell say they are "stunned and heartbroken" after the airline worker stole a passenger plane Friday from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and was killed when he crashed 25 miles away.

"This is a complete shock to us," the family said in a statement Saturday night. "We are devastated by these events, and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now."

The statement said Russell, 29, was "a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend."

Referring to audio recordings of Russell talking to air traffic control during his hour-long flight, the statement said his "intent was not to harm anyone. He was right in saying that there are so many people who have loved him."

Russell, a Horizon Air ground service agent for three and a half years, was the only person aboard the plane, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said. The job of a ground service agent includes directing aircraft for takeoff and gate approach, handling baggage and tidying and de-icing planes, authorities said.

The incident, which the FBI's Seattle office did not consider terrorism, raises questions about airport security. Investigators headed Saturday to the crash site to recover the plane's data recorders and Russell's remains as part of a criminal probe, authorities said.

Russell, who was not a pilot, at the controls, officials said. The 76-seat Horizon Air turboprop plane took off without authorization at 7:32 p.m. local time Friday, withRussell, who was not a pilot, at the controls, officials said.

After Russell talked periodically with air traffic controllers for about an hour, the plane crashed at Ketron Island,officials said.

JUST WATCHED Hear audio from before plane crashed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear audio from before plane crashed 01:12

Video from a witness on the ground shows the plane at one point pulling up for a loop, putting the aircraft upside-down and then pulling back up just feet above a body of water.

Airports nationwide will now look at whether their security procedures need to change, CNN safety analyst David Soucie said. For one, Russell shouldn't have been able to board the plane alone, he said.

"There is a protocol to not allow anyone singularly to get onboard an aircraft," Soucie said. "If you're going to access the aircraft ... you make sure that you check with someone else, and that someone else (will confirm) that ... you have the right authority to get onto that aircraft."

Latest developments

Airline and Seattle airport officials revealed the following at a news conference Saturday:

-- Russell was credentialed to be in secure areas at the airport, said Brad Tilden, CEO of Alaska Air Group, which owns Horizon Air.

-- He passed a series of background checks to gain his position, as he didn't have any criminal convictions.

-- Airline officials believe he was in uniform and worked a shift Friday, Tilden said.

-- The plane had been parked in a maintenance area and was not scheduled for a passenger flight, Tilden said.

-- He had no purpose to be at that plane Friday evening "other than ... what he did do," Tilden said.

-- Besides his other duties, he was qualified to tow aircraft, said Gary Beck, Horizon Air's president and chief executive officer.

-- Officials don't believe Russell had a pilot's license, and they don't know how he knew to fly the plane.

'I would like to apologize ... got a few screws loose'

In audio recordings of the incident posted on Broadcastify, Russell can be heard talking to air traffic controllers as they try to guide him to land the plane.

At one point, he apologizes and says he is a "broken guy" with "a few screws loose."

"I've got a lot of people that care about me, and it's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this," Russell says. "I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now."

The sheriff's department described Russell as suicidal. It did not elaborate.

Earlier in the flight, Russell says: "This is probably, like, jail time for life, huh? I mean, I would hope it is, for a guy like me."

"Well," a controller responds, "we're not going to worry or think about that. But could you start a left-hand turn, please?"

Later, a controller discusses getting a pilot on the radio to help Russell control the aircraft.

JUST WATCHED Hear audio from before plane crash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear audio from before plane crash 01:12

"Nah, I mean, I don't need that much help. I've played some video games before," Russell responds.

Russell repeatedly says he would do a roll. Not long before the crash, a pilot who'd been helping controllers advise Russell appears to mention the maneuver.

"Congratulations. You did that. Now let's land that airplane safely and don't hurt anybody on the ground," the helping pilot radios.

Russell responds: "Awwww-right. Ah, dammit. I don't know, man! I don't know! I don't want to. I was kinda hoping that was going to be it. You know?"

The plane eventually crashed on sparsely populated Ketron Island, starting a fire in the woods but injuring no one outside the plane. The fuselage was fragmented and appeared to be upside down, said Debra Eckrote, regional chief for the National Transportation Safety Board.

F-15 jets chased the plane

The plane was a Q400, a Bombardier turboprop plane, one of about 40 the airline has in its fleet.

Within minutes of the plane's takeoff, the military scrambled two armed F-15 jets from Oregon to follow it, according to local and airline authorities and two sources with knowledge of the situation. They pursued the aircraft before it went down on Ketron Island, between Tacoma and Olympia.

"NORAD fighters did not fire upon the aircraft," North American Aerospace Defense Command said Saturday morning in a news release. The jets' capability was appropriate to the potential task, one of the sources said, without offering details.

F-15 "pilots kept plane out of harms way and people on ground safe," the sheriff's office tweeted. The jets were not involved in the crash, it said.

The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, but the F-15s did not bring the plane down, Eckrote said.

Witness thought it was an air show

Witnesses described the surreal scene after the plane left the airport. John Waldron was walking along a trail near the bay when he noticed the two military jets following a plane doing aerobatics.

"I thought they were practicing for an air show," he said.

The plane was a Bombardier Q400, like this Horizon Air plane shown in May 2017. Horizon Air is a sister carrier to Alaska Airlines.

After the plane approached Ketron Island, Waldron saw a thick column of smoke followed by a loud explosion, he said.

"Everyone was literally frozen in place, muttering about what possibly happened," he said.

Kathleen Reichel said she watched the planes pass by for about two minutes.

"My husband and I are recently former Boeing employees, and we were wondering why a jet was near the passenger airplane," she said. "We heard the jet because our windows were down while we were waiting in the ferry line to go to Anderson Island, which is adjacent to Ketron Island."

He had some flight skills, expert says

It wasn't immediately clear what training, if any, Russell had in flying planes.

A ground service agent's tasks don't involve touching planes' controls, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said.

But the plane made turns and aerobatic maneuvers that suggest some skill, she said.

"In this plane, he certainly knew how to retract the landing gear, he coordinated both engines, powered them up to get a coordinated takeoff," she said. "A couple of the turns, it looked like what we call in basic flight training a 'coordinated turn,' meaning that he not only used the yoke ... but you also coordinate with the rudders and you do the turns.

"Yeah, he knew how to fly," she continued. "But ... the air traffic controller had to tell him how to set what they call the 'bugs' -- they're just little, sort of, little levers, or little notches on your indicator for your heading, ... which is kind of basic.

"So, (he) had some knowledge but clearly wasn't a commercial pilot."

Federal agencies are investigating

"Our hearts are with the families of the individual aboard as well as all of our Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees," said Constance von Muehlen, the airline's chief operating officer.

The FBI will lead the investigation, said Eckrote, the NTSB regional chief.

"The FBI is going to be thorough, which means taking the time needed to scour the area, delve into the background of the individual believed responsible for Friday night's incident, and review every aspect with all appropriate public and private partners," the FBI's Seattle office tweeted Saturday afternoon.

Investigators on Saturday were trying to retrieve the plane's flight data recorder and its cockpit voice recorder.

"He might have been talking to himself in the cockpit," so the voice recorder may provide additional information that wasn't recorded in radio traffic, she said.

President Donald Trump was briefed on the incident and is monitoring the situation, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Saturday morning.

Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Kathleen Reichel's first name.
__label__politics (CNN) Mayra Valadez still had two weeks left of her internship in the US House of Representatives when her bank balance dropped below $25.

A first-generation, low-income student from Los Angeles, Valadez had aspired to work on Capitol Hill since high school. While attending Cornell University, the only way she could afford the unpaid House internship she was offered was to use $4,000 of her scholarship money to fund the summer in Washington D.C., one of the most expensive cities in the country.

But seven weeks in, her funds ran out.

Unpaid House internships like Valadez's are common. According to a report by the nonprofit Pay Our Interns , more than 90% of House members aren't paying their interns. Broken down by party, only 8% of Republican representatives and 4% of Democrats pay their interns.

Unpaid congressional internships have been the norm since the 1990s, but that could end soon in the Senate. In June, Senators allocated $5 million to begin paying their interns. The provision is part of a broader spending bill that's currently in conference, where the House and Senate are hashing out a final version of the bill.

The House has yet to approve such legislation.

Choosing between dinner and the Metro

From taking second jobs to walking 11 miles per day to avoid Metro costs, House interns like Valadez have struggled to make ends meet for decades.

work Unpaid internships are billed by many representatives' websites as an " invaluable experience ," but an internship in Washington could cost each intern roughly $6,000, including housing, meals and transportation, according to at least one analysis of the total costs of an out-of-state internship by Time journalist Alexandra Mondalek

Faced with a financial crisis, Valadez had to say "no" to dinners with colleagues, could no longer afford healthy food and sometimes sought out events with free meals while she interned in summer 2017.

"I couldn't rely on my parents," Valadez told CNN. "They don't have the resources to help me and I knew that."

Marie Divine

Even middle-class students struggle, like 20-year-old Marie Divine from Kansas City, Kansas, who was a House intern this summer. Money is especially tight right now, Divine says, because her single mother is going into debt paying for her and her sister's educations.

While interning on the Hill, Divine worked 50 to 60 hours per week and shared one bedroom with two roommates that cost about $2,000 per month. She couldn't afford to buy food at most grocery stores and once walked 45 minutes in a downpour for a less expensive produce option. She says she often skipped lunch to save money.

"Am I going to have dinner tonight or am I going to get home on the Metro? That's really what it comes down to," Divine told CNN.

Fighting for intern pay

Members of Congress rely on interns to take constituent calls, file and answer emails and give tours to visiting constituents. Today, the decision to pay interns differs from office to office in the House.

Some members of Congress -- including Reps. Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, Texas Democrat Joaquin Castro and North Carolina Republican Virginia Foxx -- pay their interns a stipend. Others, such as Reps. Bobby Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, pay hourly. All the offices mentioned above can pay their interns because they dip into their Members' Representational Allowance to cover intern stipends or hourly rates. Some offices offer college credit, which in effect means interns pay tuition to work there. Most representatives don't pay at all, according to Pay Our Interns.

But congressional internships weren't always unpaid. Founded in 1973, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Congressional Internship Program designated money to House offices to pay interns. However, when the program ended in 1994 , so did intern compensation in most offices.

Pay Our Interns , which prioritizes helping low-income and working-class students afford summer internships on the Hill, lobbies Democratic and Republican members of Congress to pay their interns. The organization's current mission? Pushing the House to pass legislation similar to the Senate's.

CNN reached out to dozens of congressional offices and many representatives expressed interest in paying interns, but said the situation is complicated. For example, House members are capped at hiring 18 paid staff members and four non-permanent paid staff members, and a paid intern would take up one of those slots.

California Democrat Rep. Judy Chu says that because she chairs a caucus, she frequently hits that cap.

"Many offices have difficulty finding room in their Congressionally-set budget, and pay is already too low for permanent staff," Chu said in a statement to CNN. "I support making the appropriate adjustments to change that."

A House GOP leadership aide, when asked if there were any major efforts underway by the House to allocate money for interns, noted that House offices have always been able to use their Members' Representational Allowance to pay interns. However, most choose not to.

Fierce competition for resources

Many low-income students like Valadez can only afford unpaid Hill internships because of programs that help with funding.

The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Valadez applied to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's intern program, which covers a student's travel costs, housing and Metro fees, and offers a bi-weekly stipend. But the program is extremely competitive and Valadez didn't land a spot.

Mayra Valadez

According to CHCI's Director of Leadership Programs Dennis Gonzalez, only 30 of 442 applicants for the summer 2018 program made the cut. The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has a similar program, which, according to Vice President of Programs Anne-Marie Burton, is also highly competitive.

Outside of third-party programs like these, students have limited options.

Some, like 21-year-old Portland native Sophie Peters, a junior at Scripps College, receive grants from their schools. But even with a $4,000 grant to fund her House internship this summer, Peters says she was always searching for free meals, and sometimes took babysitting jobs in the evenings after nine-hour workdays.

A pathway to a full-time job

Students like Valadez, Divine and Peters take Hill internships because they are a proven pathway for full-time jobs as a staffer or legislative aide to House members. Valadez and Peters said that the majority of staffers in their Representatives' offices were once interns. In Divine's office, all six staffers were interns, she said.

What this means is that Hill offices are often filled with former interns who could afford to work without pay.

"Rather than the future career market being driven on talent or hard work or actual passion for the field, it seems to be divided based on who can afford to work for free when they're 20 years old," Peters said.

Pay Our Interns co-founder Carlos Vera says the cost of interning on the Hill in unpaid positions diminishes the chances for students of color and low-income students to access the intern-to-staffer pipeline. When interns are paid, the applicant pool becomes more diverse. This year, the Democratic National Committee began paying interns for the first time and the number of interns of color more than doubled from 18% to 42%

"Our goal is, how do you get the most hardworking, qualified applicants as opposed to the ones that can drop $6,000 for an internship?" Vera said.

In its second year, nonprofit College to Congress is trying to accomplish just that, according to its founder, Audrey Henson. The program fully financed congressional internships for 13 Pell Grant recipients or Pell Grant-eligible students this summer.

But Vera says that while third-party programs are valuable, they shouldn't be the only way for low-income students and people of color to afford internships on the Hill.

Working towards a solution

California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, who does not pay his interns, confirmed he is currently working on a measure to lift the cap on paid House staff. The measure would not allocate extra money for intern pay, Peters said, but would allow existing office budgets to be redistributed to more people, including interns.

In addition to Peters' efforts, Vera says Pay Our Interns is pushing for the House to pass a line-item budget to designate money exclusively for intern pay, much like the Senate's current proposal and the former LBJ program.

Vera hopes legislation can be passed before the next fiscal year, in time to help interns next spring or summer.

Sophie Peters

Should Democrats retake the house in November, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would support some type of intern reform, her spokesperson said. House Speaker Paul Ryan's office did not respond to a request for comment.

The next internship cycle begins this fall. As they look back on their summer positions, House interns like Divine say that despite the struggles, they are grateful for the opportunities. Sophie Peters, who has no relation to Rep. Peters, agreed, but made it clear that she sees room for change.

"I have a great office and I know that a lot of people do think that the interns should be paid," Sophie Peters said. "But the system as a whole is not working."
__label__politics Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, is the senior senator from Massachusetts. She has just launched DeVos Watch , a new initiative to hold the Department of Education accountable. The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) Betsy DeVos recently completed her 100th day as Secretary of Education, and the resistance to her agenda has spread across this country like wildfire.

Last week, Secretary DeVos and President Trump's Department of Education released a budget that would upend the student aid program and make it much harder for students to afford college and repay their student loans. At the same time, the head of the federal student aid office abruptly resigned amid reports of political meddling by DeVos.

With the educational and financial futures of millions of people hanging in the balance, here's a place to start scrutinizing Secretary DeVos.

Early in the Obama administration, Congress gave full ownership of the federal student loan portfolio to the Department of Education, removing middlemen from the program and cutting out the profits that private banks skimmed off the system. This was a brave move that required standing up to some very powerful banks and private businesses that wanted to keep on skimming.

But now, years after the transition, the Department of Education often seems to ignore the original intent of this change and instead administers the trillion-dollar loan program for the financial benefit of nearly everyone except the students it is supposed to serve.

To the irritation of many in my own party, I regularly challenged the Democrat-led Department of Education to clean up its act on student loans. I pushed federal officials to tighten the spigot of federal funds that let fraudulent schools suck down billions in taxpayer dollars. I also fought to persuade the Department to cancel the loans of defrauded students, including thousands in Massachusetts. We made real progress

When the Department failed to hold giant student loan servicer Navient accountable after the company was fined nearly $100 million by other federal law enforcement agencies for allegedly overcharging thousands of active-duty military personnel, I called them out and helped trigger an independent investigation. Those efforts ultimately helped push the secretary of education to begin refunding money to over 80,000 military borrowers and to commit to a complete overhaul of the federal contracts with student loan servicers. More progress.

These stories show that oversight matters -- and, with DeVos as secretary of education, oversight now matters even more. During her confirmation hearing, Secretary DeVos made it clear that she knew very little about running the federal student aid program. In her first weeks, she assembled a team that highlighted her plans to actively undermine efforts to protect students from being cheated.

Two of Secretary DeVos' first hires at the Department were Robert Eitel and Taylor Hansen, both with deep connections to institutions that make big money by abusing the student aid program and preying on students. Eitel was a top lawyer from a for-profit college that recently paid a more than $30 million fine to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly "deceiving students into taking out private student loans that cost more than advertised;" that for-profit college is currently under both state and federal investigation for breaking laws meant to protect students. Meanwhile, Hansen had been a top lobbyist for the entire for-profit college industry, which has paid out hundreds of millions in fines for defrauding students.

The revolving door that shuttles people between government jobs and the corporations they police is corrosive -- but it is rarely this brazen. One of Secretary DeVos' first actions on higher education was to delay a critical rule preventing fly-by-night colleges from loading students up with gigantic debts for worthless degrees, a move that directly benefited those same colleges that have paid Eitel and Hansen for years.

It also notably benefits these for-profit colleges that have been fined and have settled before, including Education Management Corp. (EDMC), which paid out $95.5 million after allegations of illegal recruitment and consumer fraud in 2015. At the time of the settlement, EDMC was a member of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, which Hansen represented.

Next, DeVos reversed a policy preventing student loan debt collectors from charging sky-high fees to students desperately trying to catch up on their student loans -- a policy whose loudest opponent was a major student loan debt collector that was headed by Hansen's father.

As news stories exposed these relationships, I wrote to Secretary DeVos, citing Hansen's and Eitel's conflicts and the Department's recent actions, asking for information about their roles. The day my letter arrived, Hansen resigned

Oversight still works, but we've only just started. Eitel is still at the Department -- now as senior counselor to the secretary. Secretary DeVos' destructive policies on debt collection remain in place. And she recently ripped up critical reform policies that protect student loan borrowers from loan servicing companies like Navient that have demonstrated over and over their lack of concern for students. Notably, industry stocks have risen pretty much every time she has touched federal student loan policy -- including her recent announcement letting servicing companies off the hook from requirements that they affirmatively reach out and try to help struggling borrowers.

Now that DeVos is responsible for appointing the next head of the trillion dollar federal student aid office, we should all be very concerned that she may pick another person who also prioritizes the student loan industry and predatory colleges above students.

That's why today I am announcing a new project to hold Secretary DeVos' Department of Education accountable. DeVos Watch will seek information about the Department's actions and inactions around federal student loans and grants and highlight the findings. People can also participate directly by tracking the Department's actions, submitting oversight suggestions or filing whistleblower tips.

Where there are reasonable answers to the issues raised, the public will benefit from hearing them. Where there are no reasonable answers, the public will see that as well. And where Secretary DeVos and her agency refuse to answer, additional tools are available to get to the truth, including Freedom of Information Act requests, public interest litigation by student advocates and state law enforcement officials and investigations by the Department's nonpartisan Inspector General. Oversight will be a joint effort.

Accountability is about making government work for everyone. Regardless of political party, I'm hopeful that other policymakers will join me in efforts to hold the Department of Education accountable for serving our students -- not the industries that make money off them. We all have an interest in a well-run, fiscally responsible, corruption-free student aid program that puts students first. That is Secretary DeVos' job -- and it is Congress' job to make sure she does it.
__label__world London (CNN) Europe is under the spell of an exceptional heat wave that has pushed temperatures to record highs in some places and sparked massive wildfires from Greece to Arctic Sweden.

But the sweltering heat has had some unexpected results, uncovering architecture and more that had been lost to the long grasses of history. Gardens, ghostly mansions and even grenades have all emerged from Europe's parched landscape as the sun scorches the continent's lawns, fields and scrubland.

In Ireland, yellowing fields are unearthing ancient archaeological monuments, while wildfires uncovered aerial navigation aids from World War II.

Yellowing fields in Ireland have exposed markings of prehistoric ruins along the River Boyne.

Drone imagery above the world-famous Neolithic tombs at Newgrange in County Meath has revealed a string of further monuments. The pictures show circular markings etched into the landscape, which experts believe may show ancient ceremonial sites and a prehistoric mortuary.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Allen Weisselberg, a top Trump Organization official and the company's longtime chief financial officer, has been subpoenaed to testify as part of the ongoing criminal investigation into President Donald Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation.

The Journal reported that it is unclear whether Weisselberg has gone before a grand jury, when the subpoena was issued and what exactly prosecutors want to ask him, but that he is considered to be a witness in the probe.

Weisselberg and a representative for the Trump Organization did not respond to the Journal's requests for comment. A spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan, which is investigating Cohen, declined to comment to the newspaper.

The news follows CNN's publication of a recording from September 2016 of a conversation between Cohen and Trump discussing how they would buy the rights to a Playboy model's story about an alleged affair with Trump. During the conversation, Cohen can be heard mentioning Weisselberg by name, saying at one point, "I've spoken with Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up."

A former Trump Organization employee told CNN that Weisselberg being subpoenaed as part of the Cohen probe is the "ultimate nightmare scenario for Trump" because Weisselberg knows "anything and everything" about the finances of the Trump Organization.

__label__politics (CNN) We've seen a flurry of recent activity in efforts to reunite migrant children removed from their parents.

But with all the legal and political wranglings, the latest developments can be difficult to follow. Here's a quick look at what's new and what's next:

What's the latest?

-- The US government hasn't been able to find the parents of 71 children who were likely separated from their families, a Health and Human Services official said Monday.

"There are some children who we believe are separated for whom we have not yet identified the parent," said Jonathan White, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A former New Jersey governor is urging fellow Republicans to call on President Donald Trump to resign following his embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Helsinki summit last week.

In an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times earlier this week, Christine Todd Whitman wrote that Trump's recent behavior toward Russia and his performance at the Helsinki summit reveal that he is "unfit for office."

"We must put aside the GOP label, as hard as that may be, and demonstrate the leadership our country needs by calling on the president to step down," Whitman wrote.

Whitman also defended special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and called on Republicans to stand for "country over party."

"In this election year, opposing Trump is risky for GOP candidates," Whitman said. "Invoking the need to choose country over party is an overused trope. But it is essential now."

__label__politics The revelations surrounding Omarosa Manigault Newman's new memoir , and the ensuing fallout, are underscoring a level of dysfunction many now see as just part of life under President Donald Trump.

On Monday, the former senior aide revealed a recording she'd made of the President phoning her on the day after she was fired. Earlier, Manigault Newman released a tape of chief of staff John Kelly doing the firing in the White House Situation Room.

Neither contained outwardly embarrassing language. But the tapes' mere existence confirmed a longstanding reality: in Trump's White House, there are few norms or expectations of decorum that cannot be shattered.

Now, aides are wondering who else might be using a recording device to capture audio from private conversations. And they are girding for Manigault Newman to release more of her tapes, which she has teased at in a string of television interviews.

"I don't know. I'm going to watch to see," Manigault Newsman said Monday when asked on MSNBC whether she would make more of her recordings public. "I'm expecting that they're going to retaliate and so I'm just going to stand back and wait."

What is contained in the remainder of Manigault Newman's tapes is a mystery, at least for now. The recordings she has released so far are shocking only because they were created by a White House employee; the content is enlightening but not scandalous.

Nevertheless, the tapes have only deepened a pre-existing sense of paranoia among Trump staffers, according to senior administration officials, fueling an underlying suspicion that everyone inside the West Wing is out for themselves. The White House has no way of knowing how many tapes Manigault Newman might have, the official said, even as they explore legal avenues for preventing their release and punishing her for making them. The official declined to specify what specific legal steps were being considered.

Several senior aides said Monday that they doubted Manigault Newman was the only person taping her conversations at work. Trump himself used the tactic in his life as a private businessman and the question of whether he's taping his conversations in the Oval Office arose last year when he suggested there might be recordings of an encounter with former FBI Director James Comey (none ever materialized).

One administration official said Monday that there isn't a belief in the White House that Manigault Newman poses a larger national security risk after taping her conversation with Kelly in the Situation Room since she wasn't part of any classified or secret discussions of a national security nature during her time in the West Wing.

Protocols

Aides are not supposed to bring personal electronic devices into the Situation Room, which in reality is a highly secure complex of conference rooms, and there are small lockers outside of the door where staffers place their phones. However, the practice operates on the honor system and advisers are not searched before entering.

Like taped conversations and Omarosa herself, nondisclosure agreements were a vestige of Trump's former life that he brought to the West Wing and his campaign. Manigault Newman alleges in her book that Trump's campaign offered her a $15,000 per month payment in exchange for signing a binding document saying she wouldn't disclose information the President or his agents deemed confidential.

Other former West Wing staffers have landed in similarly paying gigs: Keith Schiller, Trump's longtime bodyguard and one-time director of Oval Office operations, makes $15,000 per month advising the Republican National Committee on security arrangements for the 2020 GOP convention. It's not known whether he signed a nondisclosure agreement as part of his hiring.

On Monday, Trump alleged Manigault Newman was already bound by an agreement not to speak about her time at the White House.

"Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!" he wrote.

Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 13, 2018

It's not clear what agreement Trump was referring to. But people familiar with the documents signed by senior officials early in the administration previously told CNN the documents contain little legal underpinning and were devised as a way to placate a President intent on keeping his aides quiet.

Trump later hit back at a claim Manigault Newman made in a series of media interviews where she alleged the President used a racial slur on the set of "The Apprentice."

".@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa," Trump tweeted, tagging the former executive producer of the show. "I don't have that word in my vocabulary, and never have. She made it up. Look at her MANY recent quotes saying such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true Champion of Civil Rights - until she got fired. Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn't want interviews) when she worked in the White House. Now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her. Fake News!"

Trump's White House has always amounted to an irregular workplace, sometimes proudly so. The President has brushed aside presidential norms and his advisers have touted his unconventional style as a breath of fresh air. On Monday, he acknowledged that a pitched battle between former reality television stars was not in many people's definition of the job.

"While I know it's 'not presidential' to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible," he wrote on Twitter. "Sorry!"

Publicly, White House officials have looked to attack Manigault Newman's character as they seek to knock down her most salacious accusations.

"The very idea a staff member would sneak a recording device into the White House Situation Room, shows a blatant disregard for our national security -- and then to brag about it on national television further proves the lack of character and integrity of this disgruntled former White House employee," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Sunday.

But neither Sanders nor other White House officials provided an explanation for why Trump hired Manigault Newman in the first place to manage communications for the Office of Public Liaison.

Trump himself came the closest to an explanation on Monday morning, writing on Twitter that he'd heard his aide was performing poorly in her job and antagonizing others, but that he remained enamored by her then-unyielding support.

"When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser & nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!" he wrote.
__label__politics (CNN) After serving as a deputy to Ken Starr, Brett Kavanaugh went into private practice. During that time he spoke to CNN on a range of topics including abortion restrictions, judicial nominations and Bush v. Gore.

Abortion restrictions

In June 2000, Kavanaugh talked about a recently decided case that struck down a state ban on a procedure sometimes called partial birth abortion. Justice Anthony Kennedy, even though he had voted before to uphold Roe, was in dissent in this case. Kavanaugh noted how abortion, so many years after two landmark opinions, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey, still played such a central role at the court.

Later on in the conversation about abortion restrictions, Kavanaugh nodded to the fact that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Ronald Reagan nominee, had sided with the liberals in the case. Further, he suggested that presidents sometimes choose "consensus" candidates instead of more conservative nominees who could raise a fight in Congress.

__label__world (CNN) China has accused the United Nations of relying on "unsubstantiated and irresponsible information" after an international committee released a damning report into the treatment of Uyghurs in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.

In a report Thursday , the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed alarm at the "numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities held incommunicado and often for long periods, without being charged or tried, under the pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism."

Responding to the allegations at a regular press conference Friday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the allegations were "not true."

"Maintaining lasting peace and security in Xinjiang is the common wish of all ethnicities," she said. "The policies and measures in Xinjiang are aimed at preserving stability, promoting development and unity, and improving livelihood."

The UN report cited evidence from Xinjiang that tens of thousands of Uyghurs and other minorities were being held in "long-term detention or who have been forced to spend varying periods in political 're-education camps' for even non- threatening expressions of Muslim ethno-religious culture like daily greetings."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The White House has indicated that President Donald Trump is not overly concerned by Chinese leader Xi Jinping's recent move to consolidate power by abolishing presidential term limits, but perhaps he should be.

Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters on Monday that the decision is one "for China to make about what's best for their country," but by clearing the way for his own indefinite rule, Xi has presented Trump with a challenge unique to any president since Richard Nixon in the 1970s.

Xi's push to abolish term limits means he will likely remain the most influential leader of the emerging superpower for life and have more time to dedicate to his quest to rejuvenate China's influence at the expense of the US.

Trump now has the dubious honor of being the President in office alongside the most powerful Chinese leader of the modern age, at a time when China has never been more politically and economically assertive.

Such a scenario does not just pose challenges for Trump as he tries to manage the crucial relationship with Xi, from a position of relative political weakness given his rival's strength and his own troubles and unpopularity at home.

It also raises questions about America's long-term approach to China, and the possibility that an emboldened Xi will view himself as having even more leeway to aggressively assert territorial claims in the South China Sea and Chinese political and economic influence in Asia and beyond.

"Xi's recent move is yet another example of his political dominance in Beijing and a demonstration of his willingness to act boldly and decisively, regardless of convention or tradition," according to Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia and director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

"This move will give Xi more flexibility to vigorously pursue his domestic political and economic agendas as well as his foreign policy ambitions," Denmark said.

Beijing, thanks to the rigidity of its Communist system, always plays a longer diplomatic game than the US, where China policy is subject to four-yearly disturbances caused by presidential elections.

But Xi's enhanced status will give him even more of the luxury of time that his US opposite number lacks. In the event of a serious disagreement with Trump on trade or North Korea, for instance, Xi could simply wait him out in the knowledge that he will face another president sooner or later.

Xi's elevated status also further emphasizes the power imbalance between his relative strength and Trump's own more compromised political position -- a situation that analysts say sometimes worries China as it fears unpredictability in the US relationship but that senior officials in Beijing also often see as a sign of a political system trapped in an inevitable cycle of decline.

A new CNN/SSRS poll on Sunday showed Trump's approval rating has dropped back to 35% -- by far the worst measure of any new president since polling records began.

"China is going to have stability in its leadership -- we may or may not," said Christopher Johnson, a former CIA analyst who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"More importantly, we have a president in China who whatever else you might say is fundamentally convinced in his inner being that the US is out to destroy China's system."

Trump often gripes that he has inherited a rising China, arguing that letting the Communist giant into the World Trade Organization allowed it to build wealth at America's expense.

The current situation has been the product, however, of a bipartisan foreign policy designed to ease China's rise into the international system while avoiding conflict with the US.

But the speed of Xi's stunning capture and consolidation of power and emergence as a strongman comfortable with domestic repression has surprised many observers and prompted questions about the US approach.

Bill Bishop, who writes the Sinocism newsletter about Chinese politics, said Xi's power grab was the culmination of a process set in motion at last year's Communist Party National Congress, which enshrined "Xi Jinping thought" in the Constitution, meaning he would be unchallengeable by other politicians while he was alive.

"It's just the final nail that says this guy is different. Not only is he giving China a much more assertive global vision and footprint but also he is making clear that he is upending the rules that we have gotten used to over the last several decades of Chinese politics," said Bishop.

That new model of leadership is likely to lead to a more assertive and muscular China, as evidenced by its aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea and its Belt and Road infrastructure, trade and development initiative, which will stretch from East Asia through Central Asia into parts of Africa and Europe.

"You can make the argument that Western countries are facing the most serious challenger to the global order and to US primacy since at least the Cold War -- since the Soviet Union," said Bishop.

While the White House and State Department have opted not to criticize the move to drop presidential term limits, Xi's growing power and China's rising challenge to US interests have not escaped notice on Capitol Hill.

"Instead of evolving toward liberty and rule of law, Beijing is backsliding," according to Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

What is Trump going to do about it?

In reality, Trump's policy on China may be playing into Beijing's hands.

Trump yanked the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January 2017, leaving the door open for Beijing to push its own brand of trade in a region that is home to many of the world's fastest-growing economies.

He also lavished praise on Xi in October, saying he doesn't fault China for taking advantage of differences between the way the two countries do business.

"I don't blame China," Trump said during remarks to business leaders inside the Great Hall of the People. "After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for benefit of their citizens? I give China great credit."

Trump also praised China on Monday for doing "more, probably, than they've ever done" in pressuring North Korea, but he said Russia has undercut those efforts to isolate North Korea by "sending in what China is taking out."

But despite lavishing praise on Xi for his efforts to help curb the development of North Korea's nuclear program, Trump has repeatedly indicated that the US needs significant assistance from China for sanctions against the rogue regime to have the desired effect.

A large portion of North Korean trading activity, licit and illicit, flows through China, and much of it needs formal access to banking services.

But there is little evidence to suggest that China has lived up to its promise to help choke off funding to Pyongyang.

"International sanctions on North Korea have tightened dramatically in the past 18 months and Chinese banks are attempting to signal to their global counter-parties that they are compliant with all regulations," according to Varun Vira, chief operating officer at C4ADS, which tracks illicit funding to North Korea.

"The impact is still to be seen," Vira told CNN. "Chinese banks have claimed to be closing North Korean accounts for years now, and besides, most significant account-holders at these institutions who are attempting to evade sanctions are unlikely to be overtly North Korean passport holders. They are far more likely to be Chinese nationals and companies facilitating, or acting on behalf of, North Korea."

Is Trump being played?

Trump said last week that this administration has "developed a great relationship with China, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time -- killing us, absolutely killing the United States on trade,"" and he has often touted his strong personal relationship with Xi.

But Trump's comments suggesting US-China relations are stronger than ever are "ludicrous," Denmark told CNN.

"Our relations have been far stronger than they are now, and there are several issues that could disrupt relations in addition to trade, such as North Korea, Taiwan, the East China Sea and the South China Sea," he said.

But despite Xi's most recent effort to consolidate power within his own government, Denmark said the US still maintains leverage in its relationship with China.

"The US is China's most important foreign relationship, and Beijing would prefer to avoid significant turbulence with Washington," Denmark told CNN.

"That said, China's leaders recognize that turbulence may be coming, especially if President Trump decides to take action in the economic space to demonstrate resolve or build leverage. While Xi would prefer to strike a deal with Trump, China is ready and willing to respond to any negative action that the Trump administration may take," he added.

While there is some danger that Beijing may look to take advantage of Trump's perceived ties with Xi, Denmark noted that both the Pentagon and the State Department appear wary of China's intentions.

"The Trump administration's national security strategy and national defense strategy both discussed great power competition with China as a leading challenge for the United States, and I don't expect that Trump is going to get snookered," he said.

"If anything, he may feel the need to push hard on trade issues -- despite China's ability to retaliate in kind."

__label__politics (CNN) -- Meghan McCain was on the talk-show couch, being grilled by the hosts of "The View." Does it bother her to hear jokes about her father's age? Megan, 23, started chuckling, and allowed, "He IS old!" Tension was replaced by laughter. But that was summer. These days, for Republican Sen. John McCain, age is no laughing matter.

Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and wife Cindy greet supporters Monday in New Mexico.

Age as political issue has become a reality the McCain campaign does indeed have to face. McCain turned 72 in August, which would make him the oldest man to begin a first term as president -- three years older than Ronald Reagan.

Clips of McCain making supposed age-related gaffes circulate on the Internet. Last month, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat and a supporter of Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama, said McCain's age and skin cancer history were fair game as a campaign issue. "We're talking about a reality here that we have to face." A few days ago, a liberal activist group, Brave New Films, ran a full-page ad in the New York Times, accompanied by a petition signed by more than 2,700 physicians calling on McCain to release his full medical records.

All this skates over the fact that McCain already allowed reporters a peek at eight years worth of health records, dating back to 2000, while Obama has released a one-page summary from his doctor. McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said it's a double standard. "The arbiters of this election are not demanding the same level of disclosure about Sen. Obama. He's essentially running on a doctor's note. I had a harder time getting out of high school math class." Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta report on the age and health questions surrounding McCain »

McCain bristles when it is suggested that he might lack youthful vigor. Early in the primaries, he faced a blunt question from a New Hampshire teenager. Was he worried he would get Alzheimer's disease or die in office? "I'm very active," McCain shot back. "People will judge by the vigor and enthusiasm associated with our campaign. I've out-campaigned my opponents, every race I've ever been in." He ended with a joke. "Thanks for the question, you little jerk!"

Fit To Lead Dr. Sanjay Gupta investigates presidential health

Saturday-Sunday 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »

In an effort to dispel health concerns, this spring McCain's campaign allowed select reporters, including CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a look at more than 1,100 pages of medical records. In a teleconference with reporters, Dr. John Eckstein, McCain's personal physician, declared him to be in excellent health. "I and my colleagues can find no medical reasons or problems that would preclude Sen. McCain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of the president of the United States."

Since 1993, McCain has had four skin cancers removed. McCain's biggest health scare came in December 2000, when he was found to have a Stage 2 melanoma on his left cheek. The cancer was about as wide as a dime and a little thicker than a nickel. By today's standards, his surgeons took an extremely aggressive approach, removing more than 30 lymph nodes even though a test showed the cancer had not spread. McCain's surgeon, Dr. Michael Hinni, said they simply wanted to err on the side of caution.

McCain's records might be an open book compared to Obama's, but his campaign is a long way from full disclosure. They gave reporters three hours to look through the massive stack of paperwork, and didn't allow pictures or photocopies.

Dr. Wendy Epstein is a dermatologist who signed a petition calling on McCain to release all his records to the public. "Anybody running for the president gives up their right for personal privacy. Their health is my concern." Epstein, who said she's a registered Democrat married to a Republican, said it's not clear whether McCain's most severe melanoma was related to the others, a so-called metastasis. "We need to know: Did this melanoma spread, or didn't it? And that can only be answered by an independent group of dermatopathologists, looking at slides."

Hinni and McCain's dermatologist, Dr. Suzanne Connolly, said it was not a gray area: The cancer was clearly Stage 2. Gupta, one of few reporters to see the pathology report, said the file backs up that assertion. Eight years post-removal, Connolly said the chance of a recurrence is less than 10 percent. Bounds, the McCain spokesman, said it is "unacceptable" that doctors who haven't examined McCain are questioning his own physicians. "This is a highly respected team of doctors he's been working with. They have concluded he is in perfect health." Coming this weekend on CNN: Fit to Lead

Dr. Thomas Perls, a geriatrician who has conducted some of the most extensive research on aging, said advantages ranging from good health care to good genes work in McCain's favor. McCain likes to point to his mother, Roberta, still spry and giving interviews at age 96. Perls agreed that longevity runs strongly in families. "Having a 96-year-old mom who's in pretty good shape definitely bodes well for him, and not only for his ability to get to older years, but to spend a greater period of that time in good health."

Perls' greater concern is mental sharpness. "While we have some data about [McCain's] cholesterol and some other physical exam features, we don't really have good testing of his brain," said Perls. Studies based on census data show that by age 79, one in six Americans is suffering from cognitive decline, and that each year 12 percent of that group progress to full-blown dementia.

To be clear, those are simply averages for the population as a whole, and there is no indication that McCain is suffering a cognitive decline. Voters might take heart from other leaders who served well into their golden years. Israel's Golda Meir was 76 by the time she left office. French President Charles de Gaulle was 78, and Nelson Mandela led South Africa until he was 80.

Or McCain might take a page from Ronald Reagan, who was 73 when he ran for re-election in 1984. During a televised debate against Walter Mondale, then 56, Reagan famously began by saying, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I will not hold my opponent's youth and inexperience against him." The audience laughed. Reagan went on to win the election.

__label__world Redding, California (CNN) A woman and her two great-grandchildren who had been missing since Thursday died in Northern California's deadly Carr Fire, according to their relatives.

Melody Bledsoe's home was engulfed in flames Thursday. Family members then searched for Bledsoe and her two great-grandchildren, 4-year-old Emily Roberts and 5-year-old James Roberts, in area shelters and hospitals, hoping they were among the 38,000 people who have fled the danger in Shasta County, said the children's aunt, Shelley Hoskison.

"With a heavy heart we are sad to inform you all that Mel and the great grand babies were confirmed to be in the home," the family said on a GoFundMe page

CNN has reached out to the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, Medical Examiner and multiple family members for additional details and comment, but has not heard back.

The Carr Fire nearly doubled in size to 83,800 acres Saturday. The rapidly spreading fire -- fueled by soaring temperatures, erratic winds, dry air and heavy vegetation -- scorched more than 32,000 acres overnight and was only 5% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. It has already claimed at least two lives, destroyed 536 structures and threatened thousands more.

"This fire is scary to us. This is something we haven't seen before in the city," Redding Police Chief Roger Moore told reporters Friday night. "It's changing direction radically."

The blaze was continuing its chaotic path Saturday west of Redding, prompting more evacuations.

"Time to go Igo. The fire is coming down muletown ready to hit placer," the Igo Ono Fire Department posted on Facebook, referring to local roads. "Time to go now. Leave Igo take your pets time to go."

More than 3,000 fire personnel are battling the blaze with more than 300 engines and 17 helicopters, Cal Fire reported , as tall smoke plumes turn the sky an eerie orange-brown hue.

The fire began Monday when a vehicle suffered mechanical failure, officials said. Firefighters had been making progress containing it until Thursday night, when it doubled in size.

Death toll rises

Flames engulf a home in Redding, California.

At least two people died fighting the fire, and several others have been hurt.

Jeremy Stoke, a fire inspector with the Redding Fire Department, died Thursday, the Redding firefighters union said.

"Jeremy died while battling the Carr Fire," the union posted on Twitter. "We ask for your thoughts and prayers for his family and the RFD as we process this tragic loss."

With heavy hearts we announce the passing of Fire Inspector Jeremy Stoke. Jeremy died while battling the Carr Fire.

More information will be released as it becomes available. pic.twitter.com/3adHIkDepV — Redding Firefighters (@reddingff_1934) July 27, 2018

A private-hire bulldozer operator, who was not identified, also died Thursday while battling the fire.

Additional details on the fatalities were not available.

Three Marin County firefighters were treated for burns to the ears, hands and face after they encountered a "sudden blast of heat" from burning vegetation. Engineer Scott Pederson and firefighters Tyler Barnes and Brian Cardoza have been released from a hospital, the fire department said Friday in a news release.

A fourth firefighter was being evaluated at the UC Davis Burn Center, the news release said.

Eight people were treated for respiratory and burn-related injuries at Mercy Medical Center in Redding, a hospital spokeswoman said Friday morning.

'I can't believe it's gone'

The fire forced many residents to gather belongings and escape in just minutes.

"We didn't think the fire was going to come here, so we didn't really take things out like everyone else that was scrambling at the last minute to get out when we saw fire on the ridge," Dominic Galvin said.

A resident of French Gulch, west of Redding, said she had two hours to evacuate, but some people had only 30 minutes.

"It's terrifying," Rachel Hines told CNN affiliate KRCR . "You're frightened a little bit because you don't know if you're going to come back to your house and the town is going to be different."

A cat named Jinx takes refuge in a green bush on a hillside behind a burning home.

Chris Corona went to his parents' home to look for their cat, Jinx. The home was gone, but Jinx was there, safely hiding in a bush on a hillside untouched by the flames that killed all the other vegetation.

Corona wept as he thought of things they lost in the house.

"I can't believe it's gone. All those memories, childhood memories," he said. "Stuff that parents save, like stuff you built as a little kid for your mom. I'm just glad my mom got all the valuable stuff that she wanted out."

Looting has been reported in abandoned residences in Redding, and some arrests have been made, according to Police Chief Moore.

Cal Fire also reported Saturday that a separate blaze burning since July 13 near Yosemite National Park, known as the Ferguson Fire, has grown to 49,619 acres and is 29% contained.

Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the ages of Emily and James Roberts. Emily was 4-years old and James was 5-years old.
__label__world (CNN) The mammoth infernos raging across California will likely get worse before they get better, with menacing weather forecast for the rest of the week.

Eight people have already died from two of the most destructive wildfires -- the Carr and Ferguson fires.

Smoke from the Carr and Ferguson fires can be seen in satellite images.

And extreme heat -- combined with bone-dry conditions -- will help fuel the fires.

"California can expect to see hot, dry and breezy conditions through the end of the week," CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said.

Temperatures will soar into the lower 100s in many places, Norman said, and whipping winds will be "wildly fluctuating as the fires generate their own localized wind."

Across California, more than a dozen other large wildfires are blazing out of control. Here's a look at some of the most dangerous:

Carr Fire's destruction is 'like an atomic bomb'

The deadliest of the current wildfires, the Carr Fire , is now the seventh most destructive inferno in California history, state fire officials said.

Six people have died in this blaze, including three members of the same family

The Carr Fire has destroyed more than 112,000 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -- also known as Cal Fire . That's an area larger than Denver. It was 30% contained late Tuesday.

Redding police issued some good news Tuesday evening. They said 16 of 20 people missing in Shasta County had been found in less than two hours. Four remain missing.

Josh Lister and his family lost their home and belongings after the fire swept through Redding, a city of almost 100,000 people.

"It was a firestorm when we left," Lister said.

Afterward, he was stunned to see the devastation in his neighborhood.

"It looked like an atomic bomb went off," he said.

The Carr Fire is so large and intense that it created its own localized weather system , making it difficult to predict which way the blaze will spread.

More than 3,300 fire personnel are battling the flames in triple-digit heat as shifting winds, dry fuel and steep terrain all work against them.

The flames were sparked July 23 by the mechanical failure of a vehicle, Cal Fire said. Since then, it has destroyed more than 880 homes.

Ferguson Fire kills 2 people

An abundance of trees killed by drought and bark beetles has helped the Ferguson Fire spread quickly.

After 19 days of destruction, the Ferguson Fire in central California was only 33% contained Tuesday evening.

A huge problem facing firefighters is that the flames are largely burning in steep, inaccessible terrain.

Unlike the Carr Fire, authorities don't know what started Ferguson, which has now engulfed more than 58,000 acres.

Wildfires 'we have historically never seen' before

In the past several days, smoke from the California wildfires has stretched all the way to Oklahoma

And California has already spent a quarter of its firefighting budget for the year in the month of July.

Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox said the intensity of this summer's wildfires is historic.

"What we're seeing in California right now is more destructive, larger fires burning at rates that we have historically never seen," he said.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former FBI director James Comey says his belief that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 presidential election played a role in the way he handled the investigation into her use of a private email sever as secretary of state.

The former FBI director, who was abruptly fired by Trump last year, announced in July 2016 that he would not recommend charges in the investigation of Clinton's email practices. But in a controversial move, Comey told Congress just days before the election that the FBI was reviewing additional emails in relation to the investigation. In early November, Comey then informed lawmakers that those emails did not warrant any further action.

"Wasn't the decision to reveal influenced by your assumption that Hillary Clinton was going to win, and your concern that, she wins, this comes out several weeks later and then that's taken by her opponents as a sign that she's an illegitimate president?," Stephanopoulos asks.

"It must have been," Comey responds, adding, "I don't remember consciously thinking about that, but it must have been. I was operating in a world where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump. I'm sure that it was a factor. I don't remember spelling it out, but it had to have been. That she's going to be elected president, and if I hide this from the American people, she'll be illegitimate the moment she's elected, the moment this comes out."

__label__politics New York City (CNN) The Democratic National Committee said late Wednesday night that what it had earlier feared was the beginning of a sophisticated attempt to hack into its voter database, was, in fact, an unauthorized "simulated phishing test" and not an actual attempt to hack into its systems by an adversary.

The Democratic Party of Michigan confirmed to CNN on Thursday morning that it had made a "misstep" and was responsible for the scare.

"We have taken heightened steps to fortify our cybersecurity -- especially as the Trump Administration refuses to crack down on foreign interference in our elections. In an abundance of caution, our digital partners ran tests that followed extensive training. Despite our misstep and the alarms that were set off, it's most important that all of the security systems in place worked," Brandon Dillon, the chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Bob Lord, the DNC's chief security officer, briefed Democratic officials after detecting a fake login page that was designed to look like the access page Democratic Party officials and campaigns across the country use to log into a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the party's voter database, a Democratic party source told CNN.

The initial detection of the apparent hacking attempt by a cybersecurity firm on Monday prompted the DNC to call the FBI, the source said.

__label__politics "The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders," tweeted Donald Trump , who, relatedly, is the President of the United States. "I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!"

So. Totally. Staggering.

There are those who would urge us to look away from this Trump tweet -- and the broader story of Sanders' expulsion from the Red Hen -- because it distracts from the family separation crisis at the border. And that's just what Trump wants! That's why he's sending this tweet!

I disagree. First, this is an official statement from the President of the United States. As outlandish and ridiculous as it is, it's still an official White House statement. Second, it's been proven over and over again that Trump's Twitter feed is the best window into what the most powerful person in the country is thinking about -- and cares about -- in a given moment in time.

That means you don't get to ignore these tweets.

(Sidebar: I don't buy into this 3-dimensional chess theory of Trump -- that every move he makes is somehow calculated as part of a broad effort to advance some sort of plan only he can see. As I've written before, I think there is far more evidence that Trump is playing 0-dimensional chess than he is the 3-dimensional kind.)

So, yes, this reads like a disgruntled Yelp review. ("The food was terrible -- and such small portions!") But that's exactly the point! The President of the United States is running down a tiny restaurant in a college town! Someone who is currently trying to see his way through a self-created crisis on the border. Someone who is trying to make good on a handshake agreement regarding the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And someone, speaking of nukes, who has control of the entire US nuclear arsenal.

And yet, at 7:41 a.m. ET on Monday, what Trump was thinking about was that a restaurant kicked out his press secretary. And his chosen method of retaliation was a negative attack on the quality of the restaurant, which, coincidentally, will now be booked from here to eternity by liberals as a way of saying "thank you" for standing up to Trump and his administration.

That Trump felt the need to respond at all is a window into his psyche: He is someone who has never been able to let a slight go. Write a negative review of one of his hotels? Or of "The Apprentice"? Or of his presidential campaign? You are part of the cadre of "haters" and "losers" who are forever trying to deny Trump the praise and fame he believes is his right. And because he is Trump, he might just call you up or, more likely, tweet at you to express his displeasure.

Trump is now and always has been a low-road guy. Because he takes every negative comment as a personal slight, he feels the need to respond to every Tom, Dick and Harry who critiques him. And to do so -- as he did with the Red Hen -- in tremendously personal ways.

There's an old saying in politics (and life): Don't punch down. As in, there is no reason, if you are the President, to attack someone who owns a small restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, because, no matter what you say about them, you elevate them to your level -- and they win. (That same "don't punch down" advice is what the PR folks tell me when I want to respond to a nasty tweet directed at me. I, usually, listen.)

That's never been Trump's way. He thinks that when you get punched, you always, always, always punch back. It doesn't matter who does the punching. What matters is that you punch back -- and, in so doing, make clear you aren't going to just let people (any people) just punch you for free.

What that approach to life yields is a smallness with which we are not accustomed in our presidents. That smallness -- no slight too small to respond to! -- is yet another way in which Trump differs from the 43 people who have held the office of president before him. Those men saw the low road and usually tried to stay off it. Trump sees only the low road and proudly marches on it.
__label__world Washington (CNN) Nine high-profile Russians, including several high-profile diplomats, have died over the nine months since the US presidential election on November 8.

Among the recent deaths were six Russian diplomats. Some of the deaths appeared natural and governments have ruled out foul play.

In some cases, though, questions remain. That's either because the facts have changed over time, details are hard to come by, or the deaths are still under investigation.

Self-proclaimed online sleuths and conspiracy theorists have filled the information void with speculation that the deaths were somehow related to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. No evidence has surfaced to make such a connection.

Here's a rundown of the nine deaths -- and one near-fatality:

In this photo taken on Monday, Feb. 27, 2017, Denis Voronenkov visits a movie theater in Kiev, Ukraine.

Russian ambassador to Sudan dies while swimming

He died while swimming in the pool of his residence, according to state broadcaster Russia 24, after manifesting symptoms of an acute heart attack.

Embassy spokesman Sergei Konyashin said the staff called an ambulance but doctors were not able to save the ambassador. He was appointed to the post in 2013.

The Sudanese police have ruled out the possibility of an assassination attempt, Russia 24 reported, quoting local law enforcement agencies.

Russian politician who fled to Ukaine shot dead

Denis Voronenkov, 45, was gunned down Thursday outside a hotel in Kiev. Voronenkov and his wife both spoke out against Russian President Vladimir Putin after they left Russia for Ukraine in October.

Voronenkov also helped Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian influence, testifying in a treason trial against ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was perceived as a puppet politician for Putin.

Ukraine's president called the shooting a "Russian state terrorist act." Russian authorities denied the accusation.

Russian ambassador to the UN suddenly dies

Vitaly Churkin, 64, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, died on February 20 of an apparent heart attack . He was "in his office fulfilling his duties" when he died, according to a statement from the Russian mission at the UN.

Russian ambassador to India dies after brief illness

Alexander Kadakin, 67, the Russian ambassador to India, died on January 26.

A spokeswoman for the Russian embassy in New Delhi said that Kadakin died after a short illness and that there was nothing "special or extraordinary" about the circumstances that led to his death.

Kadakin had worked in India since 2009. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as "a great friend of India" who worked hard to strengthen relations between the two countries.

Russian diplomat found dead in Athens

Andrey Malanin, a senior diplomat at the Russian embassy in Greece, was found dead in early January.

Malanin, 54, was the head of the Russian embassy's consular section in Athens. Police sources told CNN that worried colleagues called authorities after Malanin didn't show up to work for a few days. Police entered his apartment on January 9 and found him dead on his bedroom floor.

Initial reports from Greek police suggested Malanin died suddenly from natural causes. Two Greek police officials said foul play was not suspected. An investigation remains underway.

Former intelligence official found dead in his car

Oleg Erovinkin, who had close ties to Russian intelligence, was found dead on December 26 sitting in his car on the streets of Moscow. Russian news outlets reported that he was 61 years old. Russian government agencies have not released an official cause of death.

He was a former general in the Russian law enforcement and intelligence agency known as the FSB. He also served as chief of staff to Igor Sechin, the president of state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Sechin enjoys a close relationship with Putin that dates back to the 1990s.

Because of Erovinkin's background, conspiracy theorists and Russia watchers have speculated that he might have been a source of information in the 35-page dossier that detailed alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia . No evidence has emerged to firmly substantiate those claims.

Diplomat fatally shot in back

Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, 62, was assassinated in Ankara on December 20. He was shot at point-blank range by a gunman while speaking at an art exhibition. The shooter, who was a Turkish police officer, shouted "do not forget Syria" during the assassination.

Russian diplomat shot to death in Moscow

The same day as Karlov's killing, Petr Polshikov, 56, a senior Russian diplomat, was shot to death in his Moscow home, according to Moscow newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets. The paper said Polshikov's wife found him in their bedroom with a pillow over his head. Underneath the pillow, police found Polshikov with a head wound.

A spokesman from the Russian Foreign Ministry said Polshikov's death was likely an accident and had nothing to do with his official government duties, according to Russian news outlet REN-TV.

Russian official in NYC dies on Election Day

On the morning of the US election, November 8, about an hour after the first polls opened in New York City, police received a 911 call about an unconscious man inside the Russian consulate. When they arrived, they found Sergei Krivov, 63, unresponsive. Emergency responders declared him dead at the scene.

Krivov, who was born in Russia, had served in the consulate as duty commander involved with security affairs, according to Russian news reports.

Russian consular officials first said Krivov fell from the roof. Then, they said he died of a heart attack.

The initial police report filed on the day of the incident said Krivov was found "with an unknown trauma to the head," according to a New York Police Department spokesman.

However, after conducting an autopsy and finishing its investigation, the New York City Medical Examiner ruled that Krivov died from bleeding in the chest area, likely due to a tumor. Police sources said foul play wasn't suspected and that Krivov had been in poor health.

__label__politics Story highlights The FEC alerted the Trump campaign that it had close to 1,100 errors amounting to more than $1.3 million in corrections

The announcement came just months after the Trump campaign shifted to an aggressive digital fundraising model

Washington (CNN) The Federal Election Commission is asking the campaign of Donald Trump to correct more than 1,000 errors in its latest financial filing.

The FEC determined that the Trump campaign accepted close to 1,100 donations, which amounted to roughly $1.3 million, that violated one of a handful of campaign finance laws.

In some cases, the Trump campaign accepted donations from groups that had not registered properly with the FEC. But in the majority, donors blew right past legal donation limits, the commission wrote in a letter to the Trump campaign sent Monday

Larry Noble of the Campaign Legal Center said the FEC letter is fairly routine.

Spokespeople for the Trump campaign and the presidential transition did not immediately return requests for comment Monday morning.
__label__politics (CNN) The government is starting to pay farmers that have been hurt by the fallout of President Donald Trump's widening trade feuds.

The USDA announced Monday that it would release an initial $4.7 billion payment, and buy $1.2 billion of surplus food.

The move is part of a larger, $12 billion aid program that was announced in July . Since then, American farmers have been waiting for details about how the money would be disbursed.

Many countries have slapped tariffs on American commodities in retaliation to the Trump administration's move to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from much of the world, as well as on many goods from China.

$4.7 billion of direct payments will go to corn, cotton, dairy, hog, sorghum, soybean, and wheat producers.

Nobuki Ito/Kyodo News via AP A building's scaffolding collapses after Typhoon Jebi hit Osaka, Japan, on Tuesday.

Typhoon Jebi, the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan in 25 years, brought heavy rain and wind to the country's southern prefectures Tuesday, overturning cars and causing storm surges that swamped an airport's runways in Izumisano.

The storm's powerful winds also made a tanker crash into a bridge that connects the airport with the mainland.

More than 8,000 residents sought shelter in 1,667 evacuation shelters, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said Wednesday.

Before the storm made landfall, it had sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph) and gusts of 165 kmh (102 mph). That's the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane in the Atlantic.
__label__world (CNN) At least 91 people were killed when a 6.9-magnitude earthquake and strong aftershocks rocked Indonesia's resort islands of Bali and Lombok on Sunday, causing people to rush out of homes, hotels and restaurants.

Another 200 were injured, Indonesian authorities said. The number of victims is expected to increase, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the head of Indonesia's disaster management department.

Hundreds of people have been taken to local hospitals and thousands of homes have been damaged, said Arifin Muhammad Hadi, head of disaster management of the Indonesian Red Cross Society.

The deadly quake was 31 kilometers (19 miles) deep and struck near Loloan on the north end of Lombok. It was also felt on Bali to the west.

The quake occurred in the early evening after sunset and was the second powerful temblor on Lombok in a week. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake shook the island July 29 , killing more than a dozen people and briefly stranding hundreds of hikers on the slopes of a volcano.

__label__politics (CNN) A longtime US Senate staffer was arrested late Thursday on charges of lying to federal agents as part of an investigation related to the unauthorized disclosure of non-public information, according to a federal indictment.

Federal prosecutors accuse James Wolfe, the former security director for the Senate Intelligence Committee, of lying to FBI agents in December 2017 about his contacts with three reporters, including through his use of encrypted messaging applications. According to the indictment, Wolfe made false statements to the FBI about providing two reporters with non-public information related to the matters occurring before the committee.

The indictment provides a detailed account of Wolfe's interactions with one specific unnamed reporter. Prosecutors say Wolfe eventually admitted to being in a personal relationship with that reporter, dating back to 2014.

Yet he "maintained that he had never disclosed to REPORTER #2 classified information or information that he learned as Director of Security for the (Committee) that was not otherwise publicly available."

Investigators obtained email and phone records for the pair allegedly showing "tens of thousands of electronic communications," including a text message from Wolfe that read in part: "I've watched your career take off even before you ever had a career in journalism. . . . I always tried to give you as much information that I could and to do the right thing with it so you could get that scoop before anyone else . . . ."

__label__world (CNN) Kofi Annan, the first black African to lead the United Nations, has died at age 80. He served as Secretary-General at a time when worries about the Cold War were replaced by threats of global terrorism, and his efforts to combat those threats and secure a more peaceful world brought him the Nobel Peace Prize.

Annan, who was born in Ghana in 1938, served as the seventh UN Secretary-General, from 1997 to 2006, and was the first to rise from within the ranks of the United Nations staff.

He had also been a member, since 2007, of The Elders, a humanitarian group of a dozen leaders and activists of worldwide stature formed by Nelson Mandela. In 2013, Annan became its chairman.

The Kofi Annan Foundation confirmed his death with "immense sadness" in a statement posted on Twitter.

It is with immense sadness that the Annan family and the Kofi Annan Foundation announce that Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate, passed away peacefully on Saturday 18th August after a short illness... pic.twitter.com/NDOy2NmAAs

Annan passed away peacefully Saturday morning after a short illness, with his wife Nane and their three children by his side during his final days, the statement said.

The foundation paid tribute to Annan as a "global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer, more peaceful world."

"During his distinguished career and leadership of the United Nations, he was an ardent champion of peace, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law."

Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the United Nations in 2001 " for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world ."

Despite his many achievements, Annan's record was not unblemished. He was head of the United Nations' peacekeeping operations in 1994, when some 800,000 people were killed in the Rwanda genocide, and in 1995 when thousands of Muslim men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica.

Annan would later say that he should have done more to prevent what unfolded in Rwanda, and that events there and in Srebrenica had reshaped his global thinking.

Tributes pour in

As news of Annan's death has spread, many are paying tribute to a man who became a global figure as head of the United Nations but was also known by those close to him for his warmth, style and charm.

Current UN Secretary-General António Guterres told CNN that Annan had been "an enormous source of inspiration" to him, adding that the late leader had been committed to his principles and values even if he had to pay a heavy price for them.

"He was not only a statesman, he was not only a leader, he was a warm person who would support his friends in difficult moments. He was a true colleague and a true friend," he said.

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Annan "worked tirelessly to unite us and never stopped fighting for the dignity of every person."

"Kofi Annan devoted his life to making the world a more peaceful place through his compassion and dedication to service," she added.

The UN Migration Agency tweeted: "Today we mourn the loss of a great man, a leader, and a visionary."

UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said he was "grief-stricken" over Annan's death. "Kofi was humanity's best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace," he said. "In a world now filled with leaders who are anything but that, our loss, the world's loss becomes even more painful."

A statement from The Elders said its members were "shocked and deeply saddened" by his death. "Kofi was a strong and inspiring presence to us all, and The Elders would not be where it is today without his leadership," said deputy chairman Gro Harlem Brundtland, adding that the group was resolved to continue to uphold Annan's values and legacy.

NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg tweeted that the world had lost one of its giants. "His warmth should never be mistaken for weakness," he said. "Annan showed that one can be a great humanitarian and a strong leader at the same time."

Carl Bildt, co-chairman of the European council on Foreign Relations and former Swedish Prime Minister, described Annan as "a man of courage, wisdom and friendship" and urged people to read his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize lecture.

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo extended condolences on behalf of the entire nation and said the Ghanaian flag would fly at half staff across the country for a week, starting Monday. As the first person from sub-Saharan Africa to become UN Secretary-General, Annan "brought considerable renown to our country," he said.

Zimbabwe opposition leader Nelson Chamisa said he had met with Annan only a few days ago. "A rare breed of diplomat; soft spoken but unshakably firm. He had great love for world peace & democracy," he wrote on Twitter. "Go well son of Africa, Champion of the world!"

Former Kenyan Prime Minister and opposition leader Raila Odinga paid tribute to Annan's "tireless work in stabilizing the world and encouraging Africa to aspire to higher ideals of democracy, respect for human rights and sound governance."

Annan was remembered in Kenya as the man who "saved the country from collapse following the 2007-2008 post-election violence," Odinga said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Annan's efforts to build the United Nations' peacekeeping potential in a telegram to Guterres, cited by Russian state news agency TASS. "I was lucky to personally interact with Kofi Annan. I have been in genuine awe of his wisdom and courage, of his ability to make informed decisions even in the most difficult, critical situations," Putin said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he was extremely saddened by the loss of an "unwavering champion for peace, justice and rule of law" and a "dear old friend."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his sorrow, saying, "We will remember him as having been very active in the international arena and as someone who fought anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial."

The director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, praised Annan as a "great leader."

Former US President Jimmy Carter, also a member of The Elders, said Annan "was a cherished personal friend and an inspiration to all who knew him."

What shaped his global thinking?

Annan was descended from tribal chiefs on both sides of his family. After studying in Ghana and at Macalester College in St. Paul, in the US state of Minnesota, he joined the United Nations in 1962 as a low-ranking officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva.

He thought he would stay only a few years but ended up spending almost his entire working life with the organization.

Then-UN peacekeeping chief Kofi Annan at a press conference in 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia.

While leading the UN's peacekeeping operations, Annan was involved in decisions that were potentially career-ending but which he managed to survive.

In 1994, the UN Security Council and others including Annan were accused by the UN field commander in Rwanda of ignoring his warnings, which resulted in the world's reluctance to send troops in and the estimated 800,000 deaths.

Speaking in 2004, Annan said: "I believed at the that time that I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more that I could have and should have done."

The next year, another moment came with the thousands of Muslims who were massacred in Srebrenica as Bosnian Serbs overran a UN "safe zone."

The Secretary-General at the time, Boutros Boutros Ghali, took the heat for UN failings in two of the darkest episodes of its history. Subsequent UN reports about the body's handling of the massacres were critical of Annan's leadership.

Champion of human rights

On taking the helm as Secretary-General in 1997, Annan became a high-profile figure who championed human rights and urged the United Nations to protect civilians if their own governments turned on them.

His first term was highly-rated but his second term, which coincided with the US invasion of Iraq, was not as smooth.

Annan would later call the assault illegal. "I think the worst moment of course was the Iraq war, which as an organization we couldn't stop -- and I really did everything I can to try to see if we can stop it," he said, speaking in 2006.

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Annan a "truly great" Secretary-General.

"It was an honor to work with him in his efforts to reform the UN, strengthen global health and peacekeeping, and reduce poverty. He made the fight against AIDS and the responsibility to protect civilians in conflict zones true priorities for the UN," they said in a statement.

"After he left office, he continued his leadership on poverty, environmental, and peace issues through his foundation." they wrote. "In every phase of his life, he held fast to his Ghanaian roots and set a powerful example of determined leadership while always treating others with respect and dignity."

In this 2003 file photo, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan greets US President George W Bush before the start of the 58th UN General Assembly.

Former US President George W. Bush, whose pursuit of the Iraq war often set him on a collision course with Annan, paid tribute to him as "a gentle man and a tireless leader of the United Nations. His voice of experience will be missed around the world."

Former US President Barack Obama said Annan "embodied the mission of the United Nations."

"His integrity, persistence, optimism, and sense of our common humanity always informed his outreach to the community of nations," Obama said.

In February 2012, the United Nations appointed Annan the UN and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria. Only six months later, he quit , citing increasing militarization in Syria and "the clear lack of unity" at the UN Security Council.

In a statement released by the United Nations, Guterres described Annan as both a personal mentor and an inspiration to all.

"He provided people everywhere with a space for dialogue, a place for problem-solving and a path to a better world. In these turbulent and trying times, he never stopped working to give life to the values of the United Nations Charter. His legacy will remain a true inspiration for all of us."
__label__politics Phoenix (CNN) He rarely showed it in his public life, but John McCain spent a lot of time thinking about this moment -- when he would face his final judgment before God.

As his closest friends have often noted this week, he was a man of great contradictions: a playboy fighter pilot turned hero, a romantic and cynic, and as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said, a man who came to accept that his honor and his imperfections would always be in conflict.

Through all of his internal struggles with his mistakes or regrets, it was his quiet faith that sustained him. Few knew that the Episcopalian, who refused to flaunt his faith on the campaign trail, could quote Scripture at length and served as the "room chaplain" to his fellow prisoners of war in North Vietnam.

His own religious awakening began in that prison and the path ended here in Phoenix at his wife's Baptist church, where McCain developed a deep belief in forgiveness and God's grace.

Those touchstones that provided solace to McCain throughout his life are threaded through the religious services that begin today at North Phoenix Baptist Church, and continue at the Washington National Cathedral Saturday, culminating with a private ceremony at the US Naval Academy where he will be buried Sunday in a plot overlooking the Severn River.

The readings McCain chose encapsulate the lessons he strove to impart: duty, sacrifice, honor, bi-partisanship, service to one's country and a commitment to a cause greater than one's self.

But they also include the prayers that carried him through his torment as a prisoner of war, and helped him through his life journey as he sought to reconcile his mistakes with his heroic public image.

I did a long interview with then-presidential-candidate McCain about his faith on his campaign plane in April of 2008. Though I'd traveled with him for many months, starting in snowy New Hampshire when he was at the bottom of the pack and had endless hours to talk to reporters, his religion was still a curiosity to me.

Unlike other politicians I had covered, he shied away from using his faith to his political advantage, even as he struggled to win over evangelical voters.

I knew he was voracious reader, but was startled as we talked by how effortlessly he quoted Scripture. He explained that prayer and church had been an ingrained part of his life in high school, where he attended chapel each morning and Sunday evenings.

It wasn't until his plane was shot down over Hanoi that he began to rely on his faith. In solitary confinement, he has written that he prayed "more often and more fervently than I ever had as a free man."

His longtime friend Charlie Black, a pallbearer today at North Phoenix Baptist Church, recalled talking to McCain about how he somewhat reluctantly became the "room chaplain" for his fellow prisoners.

"When he was out of solitary (his captors) wouldn't give him a Bible, so he would come up with verses from memory that they could study together," Black recalled in an interview Wednesday.

McCain told me that he was "very slow in maturing." He said he knew right from wrong, the Bible, the Nicene Creed and the Apostles' Creed, and the tenets of his faith, but neglected them until that five-and-a-half year period in Hanoi.

"The time came that I could fall back on them as a net, as a way of salvation," McCain said in the 2008 interview. It was the same period, as former Sen. Jon Kyl noted at the Arizona State Capitol service Wednesday, that McCain "fell in love with his country when he was a prisoner in another." Faith and his ideal of "Country First" became intertwined.

In captivity, McCain urged his fellow prisoners not to pray for their release or their own personal success.

That stayed with him. "I pray to do the right thing so I won't look back in regret or embarrassment or even shame that I betrayed my principles and my faith," he told me in 2008.

He found a home at Cindy McCain's church in Phoenix, where he came to love his pastor's message about grace: "that we're all sinners, but we can benefit from God's grace if we recognize those sins and move forward," he said.

That idea is woven through some of the Bible verses he chose for today's service and those this weekend, particularly in 2 Timothy 4:6-8 that will be read by his son Andrew McCain:

"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."

The inclusion of those verses, Graham said, gave him the most comfort that his friend was satisfied with the life that he led and had apologized for his mistakes.

"The public John McCain felt the need to reconcile his imperfections," Graham said, citing McCain's position change on the Confederate flag as an example. "The private John McCain was reassured that you can be forgiven."

In their totality, the readings and prayers in all the services represent "a Christian message," Black said. "Always trying, never quitting and trying follow the golden rules."

In Saturday's service at the National Cathedral, the messages of humility, selflessness, taking a stand against oppression -- a theme in former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte's reading from Wisdom 3:1 "The Destiny of the Righteous" --- and putting country before one's self, are also an implicit contrast to the values of the current President, said former McCain strategist Steve Schmidt.

Before his death, McCain pointedly made it known that President Donald Trump was not invited to the services commemorating his life.

"Even in death he's provoked one last fight, forced once last conversation, a choice in oppositional virtues," said Schmidt, who infuriated McCain by speaking in derogatory terms about his running mate Sarah Palin after the 2008 presidential campaign.

"Trump is his analogue," Schmidt said, "Valor to cowardice, sacrifice to self-interest, service to greed." He noted the vast international interest in McCain's life that has been evident in recent days: "People see in McCain what they like about America: the traditions of our country, the values of our country."

In the last months of his life, McCain's friends took comfort in the various iterations of the refrain he came back to again and again in their private conversations: "I wasn't cheated."

From the program of the services, they also see the friend who felt the pressure of living up to the example of his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, and the man who wrote in one of his memoirs that he tried to live a life of balance "between pride and regret, between liberty and honor."

On Saturday at the National Cathedral, McCain's son Jimmy -- who followed the family's military tradition by enlisting in the US Marine Corps -- will read the poem McCain loved, Requiem by Robert Louis Stevenson.

McCain's longtime co-author and close friend Mark Salter noted that the Arizona senator read it at his own father's funeral: "It was sort of a code for him."

With Jimmy's reading, McCain's family's military tradition will come full circle. And it is classic McCain, his friends said, a "poet warrior" and romantic to the end.

Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, And I laid me down with a will. This be the verse you grave for me: Here he lies where he longed to be; Home is the sailor, home from sea, And the hunter home from the hill.
__label__politics (CNN) John McCain and President Donald Trump are not done with one another yet.

Days of mourning for the Arizona senator, including a lying-in-state in the Capitol Rotunda and the pomp of a service in Washington's National Cathedral, are certain to become about more than simply honoring a singular political leader and national hero.

In Washington, even death is political -- a fact McCain well understood as a sought-after eulogizer himself, and by planning his funeral rites to exclude the President, he will be making an unmistakable posthumous statement directed at the White House.

Tributes for McCain and the lauding of his courage, honor, decency, character, and readiness to reexamine his own mistakes will unfold at a time when Trump is facing an unflattering public debate about his own personality and behavior. The guilty plea by the President's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and conviction of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort last week deepened the political and legal storm raging around the White House -- but still did not push most Republican leaders to criticize Trump.

In that context, the ceremonies marking McCain's passing seem sure to become more than a lament for a departed political giant. They are likely to become a debate about political morality and the comportment and principles expected of public figures in an already polarized political age that has been further roiled by Trump's disruptive influence.

After two losing presidential campaigns, McCain never made it to the Oval Office -- yet he is getting an emotional sendoff and assessment that might befit one of the men who did become President.

CNN has reported that McCain chose Barack Obama and George W. Bush -- the two men who kept him from the White House -- to eulogize him and didn't want the President to attend his funeral. If those plans hold, McCain will be sending a clear final message to Trump, after making clear when he was alive that he saw the President's demeanor, populist style and global outlook as antithetical to America's founding values and global role.

The antipathy between the Arizona senator and the President has not been stilled by his death on Saturday from brain cancer.

What the President says and doesn't say

In normal circumstances, a President could be expected to issue a fulsome written statement to mark the passing of such an important political figure. Trump simply wrote a tweet, and while members of his immediate family praised McCain's character and contribution, he did not.

The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump decided against issuing a statement praising McCain's Senate career and military service as a Vietnam prisoner of war. The paper said that press secretary Sarah Sanders and White House chief of staff John Kelly advocated calling the Arizona senator a "hero."

"My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!" Trump wrote on Twitter.

McCain's service at the National Cathedral may well become the biggest meeting of the political establishment and visiting global elites so far seen during the Trump presidency. The President's absence and failure to lead a grateful nation in mourning would, for McCain, eloquently reflect the fracture with the traditional ruling classes that he successfully made the focus of his 2016 campaign and that has become a motif of his presidency.

But Mark Salter, McCain's longtime speechwriter and confidant, told NBC's Savannah Guthrie Monday that the senator's circle did not want the week to become all about the President.

"I'm going to try very hard not to think or talk about Donald Trump for this week and just do what I can to help make sure John is buried with the honors and decorum he's earned from years of faithful service to this country," Salter said.

Not being invited to preside over a great national occasion will surely sting for a man like Trump, who relishes the theatrics of the presidency. Still, there might be a political upside, since some of his devoted base voters viewed McCain as a political relic, especially following the President's frequent attacks on the Arizona senator.

Putting the debate about Trump's behavior aside, the gathering of establishment clans may also serve as an epitaph not just for McCain, but for the brand of conservatism that he favored. McCain, a Cold Warrior, was a disciple of President Ronald Reagan and adopted the later neoconservative assertiveness of the George W. Bush years.

Trump, by contrast, has cozied up to Vladimir Putin, the former KGB man who is seeking to revive some of Russia's Soviet-era influence. The President has hammered Western institutions like NATO and the European Union that helped win the Cold War, he decries the Middle East conflicts that McCain advocated, and he believes the global trading system is rigged against the United States.

Weeks before a midterm elections, and with the next presidential race already stirring, remembrances of McCain will showcase the kind of values and policies that the Republican icon shared with his establishment contemporaries.

Public remembrance with subtle -- and not so subtle -- jabs

But given that the current President's ideas on issues like trade and the use of US power abroad are also reflected in the grass roots of Democratic politics, there's a case to be made that it is Trump, and not the congregation in the National Cathedral that will include many former politicians who have the luxury of not worrying about public opinion, who best reflects the current sentiment among voters.

Tributes paid to McCain in the United States by every significant political figure -- bar one, the President -- and by foreign leaders highlighted his character, his courage, his willingness to find common ground across the political aisle, and above all his desire to serve a cause greater than himself. All of those themes are likely to dominate the next few days as McCain's funeral observances unfold.

"Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did," Obama wrote in a statement issued minutes after McCain's passing was announced on Saturday evening. "But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John's best, he showed us what that means."

Former President George W. Bush called McCain a man of deep conviction, a "patriot of the highest order" and a "public servant in the finest traditions of our country."

Leaders of foreign nations where McCain was a familiar sight during his frenetic decades of global travel noted his commitment to the Atlantic alliance, his support for human rights, and his unshakeable commitment to shared Western values.

"John McCain - soldier and senator, American and Atlanticist. He will be remembered both in Europe and North America for his courage and character, and as a strong supporter of NATO," the Western alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, wrote in a tweet.

McCain's former sparring partners like John Kerry, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton all weighed in, reflecting the affection they felt for a man with whom they often disagreed, but whose biography and personal touch made him an American hero.

Each tribute can be read at face value, as specifically applying only to McCain. But to look no deeper would ignore the inflamed political climate raging in the second year of the Trump presidency and the roots of the feud between the Arizona senator and the 45th President.

When comparisons are drawn between the President and McCain, Trump's supporters are certain to accuse the media and his critics of exploiting McCain's death to aim what they will view as yet another unfair attack on the commander-in-chief.

But many of the tributes to McCain from the establishment politicians with whom he felt comfortable can also be read as commentaries on the importance of character in public life and America's mission and global role, and therefore as subtle, implicit criticisms of the conduct and attitudes of the man in the Oval Office himself.

After all, many of Trump's critics have long argued that he lacks the character needed of a President, a narrative that gathered pace last week as the legal woes mounted, threatening his presidency. A persistent criticism has been that Trump disdains the altruistic and patriotic motives that Obama saw in McCain and instead feeds his own ego in a search for personal recognition.

In Europe, there is deep concern about Trump's commitment to Western values and NATO -- so it is impossible to read tributes to McCain from people like Stoltenberg in any other context.

The feud begins

In many ways, the antagonism between Trump and McCain represents a microcosm of the change that the former New York businessman identified and then exploited within the GOP.

When candidate Trump said back in 2015 that he didn't consider McCain a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam, most political observers predicted that he had just buried his White House hopes by insulting the sacrifice of a man who was tortured in the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison after being shot down during the war.

But the fact that Trump refused to apologize, and even prospered in the wake of the furor was an early sign that he understood the changing dynamics of the Republican Party better than anyone else, and was in the early stages of a successful takeover bid.

McCain felt until the end of his life that Trump represents a historical anomaly and a diversion from America's traditional leadership. He maintained that core American values would reassert themselves.

"Increasingly, we have our own facts to reinforce our convictions and any empirical evidence that disputes them is branded as 'fake,'" McCain wrote in his just-published book "The Restless Wave."

That was a clear swipe at Trump, but also one at the political polarization that has made Washington so dysfunctional.

His last goodbye this week is likely to become an extended argument that for America to succeed, such conditions must not be allowed to prevail.

It is estimated that 70% of the population is foreign-born, while just 10,000 are locals, "the Monegasques."

Consequently, Monaco's 38,000 residents are today squeezed into less than one square mile of land (2.02 square kilometers) -- a territory smaller than New York's Central Park.

And when an additional 40,000 people cross the borders from France and Italy each day to work, the problem only gets worse.

A new millionaire's bay

As the people and money have poured in, more and more land has been reclaimed from the sea. Since the early 19th century, Monaco has gained an additional 100 acres, accounting for 20% of its territory.

Now construction has begun on a €2 billion ($2.3 billion) project to extend the natural contour of Monaco's coastline a further 15 acres into the Mediterranean.

Once complete in 2025, the new district, Portier Cove -- near the legendary Monte Carlo Casino, which has appeared in three James Bond films -- will house up to 1,000 residents in luxury apartments and villas.

Additional public spaces will include a hill and landscaped park, a seafront promenade and a little marina.

While the Government of Monaco is overseeing the project, private financers will front the construction cost and profit from the sale of real estate.

"Revenues for the private group through selling the apartments and houses will be more than €3.5 billion ($4.1 billion)," says Jean-Luc Nguyen, director of the government's urban extension project.

Monaco is one of the most sought-after addresses in the world, and consequently the most expensive place to buy property.

For $1 million you can buy just 183 square feet (17 square meters) of prime property, according to the Knight Frank 2017 Wealth Report , compared to 280 square feet (26 square meters) in New York or 323 square feet (30 square meters) in London.

Consequently, many famous residents have made Monaco home, including British Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic.

An eco district for Monaco

Portier Cove is designed to fit snugly into the coastal landscape in order to conform to the flow of water near the coast.

"We wanted to give it a curved shape so that it is not an obstacle to the marine currents that oxygenate the sea," says Denis Valode of Valode & Pistre, who is part of a team of architects working on Portier Cove.

Even so, building into the sea is complex and could potentially damage marine life.

But the key players involved in establishing this eco district are quick to underline its "highly ambitious target of sustainability and environmental protection."

Prior to construction, protected plant species inhabiting the project area were relocated to nearby marine reserves, and special submarine screens were installed to insulate the site and minimize the impact on the environment.

According to Bouygues Travaux Publics, the French company leading the build, water quality is being rigorously monitored by a team of independent scientific experts throughout construction.

To compensate for the inevitable loss of natural habitats, Bouygues plans to install a wide variety of artificial habitats in vertical and horizontal ecological corridors.

According to Nguyen, this is what differentiates Monaco's eco district from other offshore extension projects around the world.

"We haven't seen any other projects with this kind of (environmental) reflection," says Nguyen.

Currently, Bouygues is dredging silt from the area to lay bare the rocky seabed. The foundation will then be filled with quarried rocks to support a seawall consisting of 18 concrete-filled chambers called caissons. Each caisson is 85-foot (26-meters) tall and weighs approximately 10,000 tons.

Once this protective belt is secured in place, the final backfill of marine sand, extracted from northern Sicily, will be added.

The platform and infrastructure work should be complete by 2020 and the entire district open for business by 2025.

Making the artificial feel real

While it is an entirely artificial extension, Valode says the plan is to install a Mediterranean landscape of tall pines and other native vegetation to "give the feeling that the buildings are immersed in a natural environment."

Valode hopes Portier Cove will not only be a place of residence, but a place of life. Credit: DR: Valode & Pistre

Oversized balconies will shade the buildings from the sun in summer and help recover heat in winter. Added to this, 40% of the district's energy needs will be provided by solar panels and pumps that use sea water to heat and cool buildings.

Each apartment will span over 4,300 square feet (400 square meters), while individual houses will measure approximately 11,000 square feet (1,000 square meters).

The topography of the extension will reflect how Monaco has developed, with the structures gradually increasing in height from low-lying villas to towering buildings -- echoing the country's evolution from a fisherman's paradise to an attractive holiday resort, explains Valode.

"This is a project that is extremely contemporary, but draws its roots in the historical context," he says.
__label__politics "You know, I'm sure if my former colleagues who work with John, I'm sure there's people who said to you, not only now, but the last 10 years, 'Explain this guy to me,' right? 'Explain this guy to me.' Because, as they looked at him, in one sense they admired him. In one sense, the way things changed so much in America, they look at him as if John came from another age, lived by a different code, an ancient, antiquated code where honor, courage, integrity, duty, were alive. That was obvious, how John lived his life. The truth is, John's code was ageless, is ageless. When you talked earlier, Grant, you talked about values . It wasn't about politics with John. He could disagree on substance, but the underlying values that animated everything John did, everything he was, come to a different conclusion. He'd part company with you if you lacked the basic values of decency, respect, knowing this project is bigger than yourself."

Yes, that is, ostensibly, about McCain. But it is also an indictment of our current politics -- and a road map on how we can fix what's broken.

The prevailing "value" of modern politics is partisanship: You are good if you are on my team. You are not just bad, but morally bankrupt, if you are on the other side. You are real if you are on my team and fake if you aren't. Anything the captain of my team says can be justified (and agreed with) because, well, they're the captain of my team. Anything the other team's captain says is wrong, by default, because they're the captain of the other team. There's no reason to listen to people on the other team. Or make friends with them. Or even be seen with them. They aren't on my team. Why would I do that?

President Donald Trump is the walking, talking epitome of the sanctification of partisanship over all our other, real, values. (Yes, the irony is not lost on me -- and should not be lost on you -- that the modern patron saint of partisanship is someone who has been, literally, a Democrat, an independent and a Republican all within the last decade or so.) This is a man who has declared, repeatedly, that the mainstream media is the "enemy of the people." A man who said his Democratic opponent in the 2016 election should be jailed. A man who has called elected officials of his own party who disagreed with him " incompetent ," " weak and ineffective " and " so bad ," among many other things. A man who, while McCain was home in Arizona fighting the brain cancer that eventually killed him, would use the story of McCain voting against health care repeal legislation to symbolize the Arizona senator's alleged backstabbing. ("One senator decided to put the thumb down," Trump would say in his standard stump speech. "That was not a good thing.")

To be clear: Trump doesn't take this if-you-aren't-with-me-you're-against-me view out of any sort of principles. After all, he made his living in the private sector as a deal-maker, someone who always saw compromise as possible -- even in the darkest of situations. And as I noted above, Trump has been all over the map in terms of his personal politics. This is not a man wedded to a certain, unwavering view of what's right in the world.

Trump has elevated pure, unstinting partisanship into a virtue because it works for him politically. The Republican base was mad as hell at its elected leaders who they believed were all too willing to compromise on core principles. And not just compromise, but compromise badly; conservatives have long believed that Democrats always got the best of Republicans when it came to the sort of last-minute deal-making that Congress made a habit of producing. Compromise as capitulation was a notion within conservative circles before Trump, but he seized the idea and turned it into gospel truth. Even being seen with a member of the opposite party has become enough to draw a Republican incumbent a primary challenge from someone in their home state, insisting that the elected official has "gone Washington" or "come down with Potomac fever" or some other claptrap like that.

Now go back up and read Biden's words. And these words in particular (bolding is mine):

"It wasn't about politics with John. He could disagree on substance, but the underlying values that animated everything John did, everything he was, come to a different conclusion. He'd part company with you if you lacked the basic values of decency, respect, knowing this project is bigger than yourself."

When you read that last sentence, you understand why McCain was so openly critical of Trump, and why Trump disliked McCain in turn. McCain believed in the idea of public service as a noble -- flawed, but nonetheless noble -- profession. That the reason you got into politics was to find ways to do good, not for yourself but for the broader populace. That the most important lesson to always, always, always remember is that we all have a lot more in common than we have differences on. That focusing on that common humanity was at the essence of how politics should work. It wasn't about what team you were on. It was about what good you wanted to do -- and for whom.

That shared humanity -- the sense that we are all, in the end, in this together -- hasn't disappeared.

It can't disappear because it's who we, at root, are. What's wrong is that we just aren't looking hard enough for it. We are too willing to allow ourselves to be manipulated by people who, for whatever reasons -- political and monetary gain, mostly -- have a vested interest in focusing on what divides us rather than what unites us.

I'm under no illusion that either McCain's death (and life) or Biden's paean to re-find what McCain represented will have any immediate effect on the body politic. It's easier to retreat into partisan camps and surround yourself with people, TV talkers and the like who tell you that you're right (about everything) and those who disagree with you are your enemies, villains to be vanquished.

In the end, though, I'm with Biden and McCain. Who we are might get obscured. We might forget. But those are temporary matters. In the end, our eyes will open and our minds will remember.
__label__politics (CNN) A federal judge on Friday upheld his order that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program should be fully restored, setting a 20-day deadline for the administration to do so.

DC District Judge John Bates said the Trump administration still has failed to justify its proposal to end DACA, the Obama-era program that has protected from deportation nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.

But Bates agreed to delay his ruling for 20 days to give the administration time to respond and appeal, if it chooses.

The ruling sets up potentially conflicting DACA orders from federal judges by the end of the month.

The decision comes less than a week before a hearing in a related case in Texas. In that case, Texas and other states are suing to have DACA ended entirely, and the judge is expected to side with them based on his prior rulings.

__label__politics (CNN) In his memos documenting conversations with President Donald Trump, former FBI Director James Comey recounts Trump's "serious reservations" about then-national security adviser Michael Flynn as well as the President's concerns about media leaks and Trump's recollection of Russian President Vladimir Putin telling him that Russia had the "most beautiful hookers in the world."

The contemporaneous notes that Comey compiled have already had a major impact: They helped lead to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, formed the basis of Trump's constant criticism that Comey is "a leaker" and sparked accusations that Comey provided classified information to a friend.

But the 15 pages that are now public recounting those conversations also provide a glimpse into how Comey and Trump tried to interact and coexist despite what the President described as the "cloud" of the Russia probe, before Comey was fired on May 9, 2017.

The memos were sent to Congress by the Justice Department under pressure from House Republicans, who argue they show why Comey -- now in the midst of a high-profile book tour -- is not credible and that the memos undercut any possible obstruction of justice case Mueller would pursue against the President for firing Comey.

Late Thursday, Trump tweeted: "James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?"

James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018

There are several recurring themes through the conversations: Trump frequently brings up leaks to the media and they discuss trying to find the source of the leaks. Trump also at least twice brought up the "golden showers thing" and said he was concerned even if there was a small chance his wife had thought it was true.

In the January 7 memo, Comey writes that Trump interjected, "there were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes" about his 2013 trip to Moscow.

In his January 27 conversation with Trump, Comey recounted, in a memo written the next day, that Trump said "the hookers thing is nonsense," but then later said that "Putin had told him, 'we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.'"

Comey also writes that the President said on January 27 he had "serious reservations" about Flynn, who soon left the administration and later pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials.

Trump explained that his reservations about Flynn's judgment by discussing a story about a toast to British Prime Minister Theresa May and someone else who Flynn had said called before her after Trump was inaugurated, but Flynn had not told the President.

"In telling the story, the President pointed his fingers at his head and said 'the guy has serious judgment issues,'" Comey writes. "I did not comment at any point during this topic and there was no mention or acknowledgment of any FBI interest or contact with General Flynn."

The unclassified memos include the now-famous conversation Trump had with Comey where he told Comey, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go."

"I replied by saying, 'I agree he is a good guy,' but said no more," Comey writes.

In the February 8 memo, Comey also recounts a conversation with then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, where he says that Priebus asked him whether it was a "private conversation," and asked Comey, "Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?"

Comey said that he answered Priebus' question, but first told him that it was "the kind of question that had to be asked and answered through established channels."

Trump is also focused on loyalty, as Comey has said in congressional testimony and his book. In their final April 11 conversation, Comey writes that Trump told him: "I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know."

Comey said that he assumed Trump was referring to his previous pledge for loyalty before his inauguration, where Comey responded he would provide "honesty," and Trump responded, "honest loyalty."

Trump's complaints about the "cloud" hanging over him thanks to the Russia investigation were also included in the memos. Comey recounted in his March 30 memo that Trump said he thought he would have won a Obamacare repeal vote if not for the cloud over Russia.

In the same conversation, Trump also suggested he would sue Christopher Steele, the British ex-intelligence officer who wrote the dossier, although he never did so.

The memos provide more detail about Comey's conversations with Trump regarding the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. As he recounted in his book, Comey writes that Trump referenced "Comey One, Comey Two and Comey Three" when talking about different developments in the investigation during the campaign.

Comey also recounts how he criticized Trump over his answer during the campaign where Trump suggested the US was as guilty as Russia when it came to killings.

"'You think my answer was good, right?' I said the answer was fine. Except the part about the killers, because we aren't the kind of killers that Putin is," Comey wrote in the February 8 memo. "When I said this, the President paused noticeably. I don't know what to make of it, but he clearly noticed I had directly criticized him."

Provided to Congress

The Justice Department sent the redacted version of the memos on Thursday after three Republican House chairmen -- Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy and Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes -- demanded last week they be provided to Congress.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a response Monday that some lawmakers had already been given access last year. But after Goodlatte threatened to issue a subpoena, DOJ relented, citing "unusual events occurring since the previous limited disclosure."

The unredacted, classified version of the memos will be made available to Congress to view in a secure setting on Friday, DOJ said.

In a joint statement, Goodlatte, Gowdy and Nunes said the memos "lay bare the notion that former Director Comey is not motivated by animus." The memos show that the "cloud" Trump told Comey he wanted lifted referred to the salacious and unproven allegations in the opposition research dossier, they say.

"As we have consistently said, rather than making a criminal case for obstruction or interference with an ongoing investigation, these memos would be Defense Exhibit A should such a charge be made," the chairmen said.

But Democrats see it differently. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement that the memos show that "Trump's interference was a blatant effort to deny justice, and Director Comey was right to document it as it happened -- in real time."

Correction: This story has been updated to correct the date on which two conversations about Michael Flynn and Putin occurred. The exchange happened January 27, and Comey wrote his memo the next day.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our D.C. insiders are talking about in this week's "Inside Politics" forecast, where you get a glimpse of tomorrow's headlines today.

Congress v. Trump on trade

President Trump isn't so happy with Canada.

He's threatening to leave the Canadians out of a new trade deal between the US and Mexico, unless they agree to his terms.

And in a weekend tweet, he also warned Congress not to "interfere" with the negotiations. CNN's Phil Mattingly said Congress probably won't listen.

"Bullying trade negotiators is quite a different thing than bullying someone like, say, Sen. Pat Toomey," Mattingly said. And legally speaking, the President may need congressional approval for any new trade deal.

"Can he count on Republicans to do what they've done best the last 19 months, just grumble and accept whatever he decides to do?" Mattingly asked. "No. As one senator told me, 'this is a red line issue. It's too damn important to too many of our states.'"

McCain's Senate seat

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has a decision to make: Who should fill John McCain's Senate seat?

Ducey, a Republican, has the power to name an interim senator who wouldn't face election until 2020. The big question: will he pick a Trump loyalist, or an independent voice like McCain himself?

CNN's Jeff Zeleny said the answer could come this week.

"It's complicated by his own politics," Zeleny said of Ducey, who's up for re-election in November. "The reality here is that the politics of Arizona have changed so much. Once upon a time, this would have been appointing someone in the McCain-like tradition. Now that is likely not acceptable to so many Republicans on the ground there. One Arizona Republican I talked to said if Ducey picks anyone who is not 100% loyal to this President, it's a problem for the governor."

Massachusetts primary

Massachusetts holds its primary election on Tuesday, and the marquee race may be in the 7th Conressional District, where veteran Democratic Rep. Mike Capuano is facing a challenge from his left.

"This is a seat that the Kennedys had, Tip O'Neil once had this seat as well," said Jonathan Martin of The New York Times. The challenge comes from Boston City Council member Ayanna Pressley, a young African-American woman in a district with a large minority population.

"I was talking to one Boston Democrat yesterday who said Capuano should be okay," Martin said. "The Joe Crowley loss, I think, got a lot of incumbents religion when it comes to making sure back home was taken care of. But this race is expected to be a real race."

Trump blocks government pay hike

President Trump announced this week he's canceling a planned pay hike for federal workers -- saying the nation just can't afford it.

Government workers -- and the members of Congress who represent them -- aren't pleased.

"There are federal workers all across the country, but they're concentrated particularly heavily in Virginia, which just happens to have a couple of really competitive House races," said Julie Pace of the Associated Press.

"So you saw some of these Republican lawmakers coming out and pushing back on the President's move," Pace said. "Ultimately, Congress can still give these federal workers a raise. But Democrats I talked to said the mere fact that Trump was willing to block this raise is going to cause all kinds of problems" for vulnerable incumbents like Barbara Comstock, whose Northern Virginia district is filled with government workers.

Shutdown showdown

The government's fiscal year ends September 30 -- and there's fear in Washington that President Trump might trigger a shutdown if Congress doesn't give him a border wall.

"There's actually been a little bit of bipartisanship on these spending bills," said The Washington Post's Seung Min Kim. "But the X factor is President Trump. We have the President saying he wants money for the border wall. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan believe they have figured out a plan to punt that funding fight until after the elections. But will President Trump go along? That's yet to be seen."
__label__world (CNN) Polls have opened in Sweden's general election Sunday in one of the tightest contests the Scandinavian country has seen for decades as voters split over attitudes to immigration.

The far-right is expected to make substantial gains after a heated campaign dominated by the immigration issue, with most opinion polls showing that no single party is expected to win the vote outright.

Once a nation that welcomed refugees in high numbers, immigration has become a hot-button issue in Swedish politics following the mass migration of refugees to Europe in 2015, at the height of the Syrian war, when Sweden took in more than 160,000 asylum-seekers.

The Swedish government, led by the center-left Social Democrats in a coalition with the Green Party, has since then hardened its policies on asylum-seekers and closed its southern border with Denmark to stem the flow of migration.

The far-right Sweden Democrats, which have roots in the neo-Nazi movement, have capitalized on tensions that have arisen since the influx of refugees and have already seen a dramatic rise in support, polls show.

Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson campaigns in Stockholm in Saturday.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Friday hinted he will likely invalidate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in the future -- but for now the program can continue to operate.

The ruling was an unexpected, albeit temporary, reprieve for the program, which President Donald Trump opted to end almost exactly a year ago.

Texas-based District Judge Andrew Hanen wrote Friday that he believes DACA is likely illegal and ultimately will fail to survive a challenge before his court. DACA is an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.

But despite that -- and despite finding that the continuation of DACA could harm the eight states and two governors who challenged the program -- Hanen decided not to issue a ruling that would have immediately blocked DACA's continuation.

Since Trump sought to end DACA last September, the program's future has been in doubt. Members of Congress largely say they want to preserve the program legislatively, but have failed to pass anything in two opportunities to do so. In the meantime, three federal courts have sustained the program.

While Hanen rebuffed the red states' request to end DACA immediately, his inclination to invalidate the program eventually contributes to what experts expect to be a fast track to the Supreme Court in the coming year.

Hanen said that there were two issues that required him to deny the request to immediately halt the program: One was timeliness. He found that because Texas and its coalition of states waited more than five years after the implementation of DACA, even as it challenged a related program, to file this suit, that it lost some of its ability to claim damages were immediately harmful and thus required an immediate response.

In addition, Hanen ruled that though the states could prove they were harmed by the continuation of DACA, mainly in costs of benefits to recipients, the potential consequences of ending DACA immediately were more harmful.

Three federal judges have blocked the administration from ending DACA as it tried to do last September, ordering the Department of Homeland Security to continue renewing permits under the program.

But Hanen was widely expected to be unfavorable to DACA, as he had previously prevented a similar, expanded program from ever going into effect under the Obama administration.

The new case challenging the DACA program, instituted in 2012, drew heavily from that decision Hanen made on the 2014 expansion of the program and creation of a similar program for undocumented parents of Americans.

Hanen said in his Friday ruling that he largely agreed, and DACA was likely to be illegal under the same reasoning as that expansion.

But one major difference prevented him from immediately halting the program -- the fact that it was already in effect.

"Here, the egg has been scrambled," Hanen wrote. "To try to put it back in the shell with only a preliminary injunction record, and perhaps at great risk to many, does not make sense nor serve the best interests of this country."

But in his 117-page decision, Hanen was clear that he did not intend his ruling to be interpreted as good news for the future of DACA, at least long term.

He said the popularity of the program was not relevant to whether it had been legally created -- the crux of the challenge to it.

"DACA is a popular program and one that Conress should consider saving," Hanen wrote. Nevertheless, "this court will not succumb to the temptation to set aside legal principles and to substitute its judgment in lieu of legislative action. If the nation truly wants to have a DACA program, it is up to Congress to say so."

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who led the challenge to DACA, hailed the ruling in a statement, despite it being an interim loss in court.

"We're now very confident that DACA will soon meet the same fate as the Obama-era Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which the courts blocked after I led another state coalition challenging its constitutionality," Paxton said. "Our lawsuit is vital to restoring the rule of law to our nation's immigration system."

Hanen's ruling Friday defuses the threat to DACA for some time. In a separate order, Hanen took the unusual step of making it possible to appeal his denial of an immediate halt to the program, and gave the parties three weeks to figure out next steps before the case moves to its next phase.

The Department of Justice declined to defend DACA in the lawsuit, but did ask Hanen to limit the effect of any ruling he may have issued.

Spokesman Devin O'Malley said in a statement that Hanen had agreed DACA is unlawful, "as the Justice Department has consistently argued," and said the department was "pleased" with the decision.

In the administration's stead, DACA was defended by the pro-immigrant advocacy and legal organization MALDEF and the state of New Jersey.

In a statement Friday, MALDEF hailed the ruling but noted it still believes DACA to be legal.

"While MALDEF continues to disagree adamantly with the judge's views on the legality of DACA under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and on whether the state of Texas even has standing -- as required by the Constitution -- to challenge DACA, today's court decision appropriately leaves DACA in place with respect to over 100,000 Texans and hundreds of thousands of others nationwide," said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump will travel to Texas in October to rally support for Sen. Ted Cruz, the President announced in a tweet Friday, the clearest sign yet that Cruz and Republicans are taking a challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke seriously.

"I'm picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find," Trump tweeted. "As you know, Ted has my complete and total Endorsement. His opponent is a disaster for Texas - weak on Second Amendment, Crime, Borders, Military, and Vets!"

The President has demonstrated that he is eager to flex his political muscles on the campaign trail this fall, and he has been holding rallies in key states and granting his endorsement to favored candidates for months.

But the Lone Star State is a surprising target for the most powerful political weapon in the GOP's arsenal, with many other competitive states on the map. Cruz rising to the level of a presidential visit could be an ominous sign for Republicans, suggesting even deep red Texas is not a sure thing.

The President won't be alone in his push to help re-elect his former archrival, whom he nicknamed "Lyin' Ted" during the Republican presidential primary. Donald Trump, Jr. also plans to campaign in Texas on behalf of Cruz in October, said a source familiar with his plans, although the details of that visit have yet to be finalized.

__label__politics (CNN) If the Transportation Safety Administration eliminates security checkpoints at small airports, like the one Bryant Garrett runs in Redding, California, he worries nobody will be checking the bags and pockets of the hundreds of passengers who board planes there every week bound for San Francisco.

"Who would it be?" asked Garrett, the manager of Redding Municipal Airport, who had heard about the proposal, first reported by CNN on Wednesday.

"I, as the airport, don't want to take on either the liability nor the cost, and I'm quite certain the airlines don't want to take that on. So if TSA backs out, there's a void, and I don't know who would fill it."

Internal documents dated June and July obtained by CNN show a TSA working group is considering ending screening at more than 150 small- and medium-sized airports, which, like Redding, have commercial planes with fewer than 60 people per flight. Passengers connecting to other flights at larger hubs would go through screening before boarding their next flights, according to the documents.

TSA projections called for savings of $115 million annually and a "small (non-zero) undesirable increase in risk." An agency spokesman said the idea "is not a new issue" and the ending of screening is allowed under "the regulations which established TSA."

__label__world (CNN) French and British fishermen clashed in the English Channel Tuesday in the latest installment of the long-running "scallop war."

Video of the incident broadcast by France 3 Normandie showed smoke bombs and rocks being thrown at British crews, while a number of boats appeared to be rammed.

The five British boats, greatly outnumbered by an estimated 35 French vessels, were chased from the scallop-rich Baie de Seine area off Normandy, maritime official Ingrid Parot told AFP.

"We're trying to push the English out because if we allow them to carry on they'll pillage the area," French fisherman Anthony Quesnel says in the video.

"We have quotas, we have hours and they have nothing, no quotas, seven days out of seven they fill their boats. They come, they dredge and they fill their vessel and they go home. They work a month earlier than us and they leave us the crumbs," he added.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The US officially re-launched the US Navy's Cold War-era Second Fleet Friday, a move that comes amid renewed concern over the threat posed by Russia.

"US Second Fleet has a storied history, and we will honor that legacy," Vice Adm. Andrew "Woody" Lewis, who took command of the fleet Friday, said during a ceremony marking the fleet's re-launch in Norfolk, Virginia.

Lewis said his goal was to "build a fleet that is ready to fight. Ready to fight so we don't have to."

"Second Fleet will enhance our capacity to maneuver and fight in the Atlantic, and as a result, help to maintain America's maritime superiority that will lead to security, influence, and prosperity for our nation," Adm. Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, said at the relaunch ceremony.

The fleet was originally established in the earliest days of the Cold War and was primarily tasked with supporting NATO in its stand-off with the Soviet Union.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A new internal document obtained by CNN shows the Transportation Security Administration's proposal to eliminate screening at more than 150 small to medium sized airports is just one of several cost-saving measures the agency is discussing.

The document, which an agency source says TSA Administrator David Pekoske was briefed on last month, shows how the TSA could save more than $300 million in 2020.

Among the proposed cuts listed in the document are a reduction in full-time air marshals, a reduction in the workforce at TSA headquarters, fewer reimbursements to airports for janitorial services at TSA checkpoints, cuts for benefits for new part-time employees and a 50% cut in reimbursements to state and local law enforcement agencies for use of their K-9 units.

The TSA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Spending cuts would have to be approved by Congress, which sets the TSA's budget.

__label__politics Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) In a trial that's featured talk of hundreds of thousands of dollars in clothing, including a $15,000 ostrich jacket and an $18,000 python jacket, the latest sartorial question for court-watchers is: Where are Paul Manafort's socks?

During his 11 days at the United States District Court here, Manafort has appeared both in person and in courtroom sketches to be barefoot at times under his loafers.

Artist Bill Hennessy captured this in a sketch published last Monday that made the rounds on Twitter and was even featured in FN, or, Footwear News, which bills itself as the "the ultimate destination for industry insiders and shoe lovers alike."

After a brief recess on Wednesday of last week, Manafort reappeared with white socks under his loafers, causing a stir within the courtroom. The next day, the socks once again disappeared.

According to Manafort spokesperson Jason Maloni, Manafort refuses to wear white socks with his suits. "He doesn't like white socks" Maloni said.

__label__world (CNN) Monsoon rains and heavy flooding have killed hundreds of people and forced more than 300,000 others to seek shelter in Kerala.

Torrential rains in Kerala triggered the state's worst flooding in nearly a century, destroying thousands of homes and roads.

But there is the promise of relief in sight.

The deadly rains and high waters deluging the southern Indian state of Kerala are receding, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs said Saturday.

"There is some respite from the rainfall and water levels in the dam reservoirs are stabilized," the ministry said in a statement. "Rainfall is expected to recede further barring in one or two districts."

__label__politics (CNN) Democrats will hold their convention in 2020 earlier than they have in more than two decades, Democratic operatives tell CNN, partly out of anticipation of a crowded and contentious primary.

The Democratic National Convention is slated to take place from July 13 to July 16, 2020, almost two weeks earlier than the 2016 convention.

Democratic National Committee officials, including chair Tom Perez and interim DNC CEO Mary Beth Cahill, have considered a series of factors in deciding to host their biggest political event earlier than normal, party operatives tell CNN. But a key reason for the decision is the expectation the 2020 primary could be a combative affair with more than two dozen Democrats running, making it essential that the party allow more time for tensions to cool after a nominee is officially selected.

"The Democratic Party is committed to organizing everywhere and holding the convention in mid-July allows us to continue our work doing exactly that," Perez said in a statement. "My priority is to ensure that the 2020 nominating process is the most open, fair, transparent and inclusive in our party's history."

He added: "That is exactly why the DNC has started this process early and before we have a full slate of candidates running for president. This will not only allow for a unified party but will ensure that our nominee is in the strongest position to take on Donald Trump or whoever the Republican nominee may be."

__label__politics (CNN) Whenever America was in a fight during his long lifetime, John McCain was in the thick of it.

McCain, who has died at the age of 81, was a naval bomber pilot, prisoner of war, conservative maverick, giant of the Senate, twice-defeated presidential candidate and an abrasive American hero with a twinkle in his eye.

The Arizonan warrior politician, who survived plane crashes, several bouts of skin cancer and brushes with political oblivion, often seemed to be perpetually waging a race against time and his own mortality while striving to ensure that his five-and-a-half years as a Vietnam prisoner of war did not stand as the defining experience of his life.

He spent his last few months out of the public eye in his adopted home state of Arizona, reflecting on the meaning of his life and accepting visits from a stream of friends and old political combatants.

In a memoir published in May, McCain wrote that he hated to leave the world, but had no complaints.

"It's been quite a ride. I've known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought in a war, and helped make peace," McCain wrote. "I've lived very well and I've been deprived of all comforts. I've been as lonely as a person can be and I've enjoyed the company of heroes. I've suffered the deepest despair and experienced the highest exultation.

"I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times."

McCain had not been in Washington since December, leaving a vacuum in the corridors of the Senate and the television news studios he roamed for decades.

In recent months, he was not completely quiet, however, blasting President Donald Trump in a series of tweets and statements that showed that while he was ailing he had lost none of his appetite for the political fight.

The Arizona Senator repeatedly made clear that he saw Trump and his America First ideology as a departure from the values and traditions of global leadership that he saw epitomized in the United States.

McCain had been planning his funeral services over the last year and his family made clear that Trump is not invited, a position that has not changed, two family friends said Saturday. Former rivals and Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were asked to give eulogies, people close to both former presidents and a source close to the senator told CNN earlier this year.

McCain will lie in state in the Arizona Capitol on Wednesday, the day McCain *would have* turned 82 years old, according to the state's governor, Doug Ducey. After that service, he will be taken to Washington on Thursday, and will lie in state in the Capitol on Friday, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office.

McCain will have a national memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral on Saturday, according to the family statement. After that, he will be taken to Annapolis, Maryland, where he will be laid to rest.

McCain's two losing presidential campaigns meant he fell short of the ultimate political prize, one his story once seemed to promise after he came home from Vietnam and caught the political bug. In the end, he became a scourge of presidents rather than President himself.

At the time of his death, he was largely an anomaly in his own party -- as one of the few Republicans willing to criticize Trump and a believer in the idealized "shining city on a hill" brand of conservatism exemplified by his hero Ronald Reagan that has been dislodged by the nativist and polarizing instincts of the current President. He was also a throwback to an earlier era when political leaders, without betraying their own ideology, were willing on occasion to cross partisan lines.

In a Washington career that spanned 40 years, first as a Navy Senate liaison, then as a member of the House and finally as the occupant of the Senate seat he took over from Barry Goldwater, McCain was a conservative and a foreign policy hawk. But he was not always a reliable Republican vote, and sometimes in a career that stretched into a sixth Senate term, he confounded party leaders with his maverick stands. He defied party orthodoxy to embrace campaign finance reform, and excoriated President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, for not taking enough troops to Iraq.

After Obama ended McCain's second White House race in 2008, the senator blasted the new President's troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, causing critics to carp that he had not yet reconciled the bitterness he felt in defeat. McCain had supported the invasion of Iraq carried out by the Bush administration in 2003, but admitted in his memoir "The Restless Wave" that the rationale, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction was wrong.

"The war, with its cost in lives and treasure and security, can't be judged as anything other than a mistake, a very serious one, and I have to accept my share of the blame for it," he wrote.

More recently, as death approached, he became a strident critic of Trump, who had once said he didn't consider the Arizona senator a war hero because he had been captured.

McCain questioned why Trump was solicitous of Vladimir Putin, whom he regarded as an unreformed KGB apparatchik.

In one of his final public acts, he blasted Trump's cozy summit with the Russian President in July, blasting it as "one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory."

"The damage inflicted by President Trump's naiveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake," he said in a statement.

In July 2017, McCain returned from brain surgery to the Senate floor to lambaste "bombastic loudmouths" on the television, radio and internet and plead for a return to a more civilized political age, when compromise and regular order forged bipartisan solutions.

Then, in September, in a poignant speech that seemed designed to echo down the ages after he was gone, McCain reminded his colleagues they were a check on executive power: "We are not the President's subordinates," he said. "We are his equals."

In a final act of defiant independence, McCain, with a dramatic thumbs-down gesture on the Senate floor in September, cast the vote that scuttled the GOP's effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, causing fury within his party -- a move that prompted Trump, to the fury of McCain's family to repeatedly single him out in campaign rallies.

When the President signed McCain's last legislative triumph in August, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, he did not even mention the Arizona senator.

'I wasn't my own man anymore; I was my country's'

John Sidney McCain III, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, entered the world on August 29, 1936, in the Panama Canal Zone, a birthplace that years later would cause a brief campaign kerfuffle over whether he was a natural born citizen and thus eligible to be elected president.

His habit of insubordination despite his military pedigree emerged at the Naval Academy, where he graduated fifth from the bottom of his class.

"My superiors didn't hold me in very high esteem in those days. Their disapproval was measured in the hundreds of miles of extra duty I marched in my time here," McCain told graduates at Annapolis in October of last year.

By 1967, McCain was in the Pacific and escaped death in a massive fire aboard the USS Forrestal aircraft carrier. Months later, he was shot down in his Skyhawk jet over North Vietnam and parachuted into a lake near Hanoi, breaking both arms and a leg, and was captured by communist soldiers. In captivity, McCain was tortured and beaten, an experience that left him with lifelong injuries, including severely restricted movement of his arms. He kept himself sane by tapping on a wall to communicate with a fellow prisoner in a neighboring cell. Later, he refused the offer of a preferential release, made because his father was an admiral, until his comrades could also come home, eventually returning in 1973 to a nation politically torn by the war.

His period in captivity set the course of his life.

"I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's," McCain said in his 2008 Republican National Convention speech.

"I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasn't my own man anymore; I was my country's."

After turning to politics, McCain served in the House from 1983, won an Arizona US Senate seat in 1986 and established himself as a down-the-line conservative in the age of Ronald Reagan. But his political career almost fizzled before it began when he was among the Keating Five group of senators accused of interfering with regulators in a campaign finance case. He was cleared of wrongdoing, but the Senate Ethics Committee reprimanded him for poor judgment, an experience that led to him becoming a pioneer of campaign finance reform.

He didn't forget his time in Vietnam.

In an act of reconciliation, McCain joined Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, a fellow decorated Vietnam War veteran, to help end the US trade embargo on its former southeast Asian enemy in a process that led to the eventual reopening of diplomatic relations.

By 2000, McCain set his sights on the White House and ran as a maverick Republican, holding court for hours in candid back-and-forth sessions with reporters on his campaign bus, dubbed the "Straight Talk Express." In years to come, he would joke that his adoring press pack was his "base."

After skipping Iowa over his long opposition to ethanol subsidies, McCain forged a victory over establishment favorite and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire after a string of town hall meetings with voters.

But his effort hit a brick wall in South Carolina, where the campaign turned negative and McCain's independent streak hurt him in a state with more core conservatives and fewer independents. Bush got back on track with a primary win that set him on the road to the nomination.

The maverick of the Senate

Back in the Senate, McCain heard the call of war again, as American foreign policy was transformed after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and he became a forceful proponent of the US use of force overseas. He backed US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. When Americans tired of war, McCain warned that more troops were needed, demanding a surge in forces that Bush later adopted.

When it appeared that his hawkish views were at odds with the electorate and could damage his nascent 2008 presidential bid, McCain answered: "I would rather lose a campaign than a war."

But, influenced by his experience of torture in Vietnam, McCain was a forceful critic of the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA on terror suspects, believing they were contrary to American values and damaged the US image abroad.

It was a typical example of the Arizona senator adopting a position that appeared antithetical to his political interests or ran counter to the perceived wisdom of his party.

After the Keating Five scandal, he joined a crusade with Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin to introduce new restrictions on "soft" and corporate money in political campaigns.

Later, McCain teamed up with his great friend, late Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy on a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The measure failed, however, over building grassroots antipathy to such a move in the GOP, which would later play a major role in the Trump campaign in the 2016 election.

McCain set his sights on the White House again during Bush's second term. By 2007, his campaign was all but broke. But he fired up the Straight Talk Express again and pulled off another famous comeback, barnstorming to victory once more in the New Hampshire primary.

This time, he also won South Carolina, and beat a fading Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani in Florida before effectively clinching the nomination with a clutch of wins on Super Tuesday.

That November, McCain came up against the historic appeal of a much younger and more eloquent rival, Obama. Mocking the Illinois senator in ads as "the biggest celebrity in the world," McCain questioned whether his popular foe was ready to lead.

Seeking to rebrand himself in a change election, McCain stunned the political world by picking little-known Sarah Palin as his running mate. The Alaska governor delivered a spellbinding convention speech, and for several weeks it seemed as if McCain's gamble worked.

But a series of gaffes turned Palin into a figure of ridicule and undercut McCain's contention that his ticket, and not Obama's, was best qualified to lead in a dangerous world. McCain, however, would not say that he regretted picking Palin.

But in his new memoir, "The Restless Wave," and in a separate documentary, McCain said he wished he had ignored the advice of his advisers and listened to his gut and chosen Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat-turned-independent, calling it "another mistake that I made."

But McCain also rose above the ugliness of the campaign. On one occasion, he cut off a supporter at a town hall event who said she could not trust Obama because she thought he was an Arab, amid conspiracy theories suggesting that the Democrat had not been not born in America.

"No ma'am, he's a decent family man, citizen, who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about," McCain said.

He dealt with his defeat by throwing himself back into life in the Senate. In later years he described how it felt to lose, telling anyone who asked, "After I lost ... I slept like a baby — sleep two hours, wake up and cry."

But his relationship with Obama was tense, with the President snubbing his former foe in a health care summit in 2010 by telling him "the election's over."

The Arizona senator emerged as a fierce critic of Obama's worldview, prompting Democrats to complain that McCain was the embodiment of a Republican reflex to respond to every global problem with military force, which had led America into misadventures like the war in Iraq.

McCain's robust foreign policy views were reflected on the walls of his Senate conference room, which featured letters and photos from the likes of Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, leaders who didn't suffer critics gladly.

Still, McCain was also a throwback, enjoying friendships with rivals across the political aisle, and indulging in the back-slapping bonhomie of the Senate, where he invariably held court to a crowd between votes.

Sometimes things got testy with his Democratic pals, including when he confronted Hillary Clinton and fellow Vietnam War veteran Kerry during hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee while they served as secretaries of state under Obama.

'He served his country ... and, I hope we could add, honorably'

The Republicans' recapture of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections gave McCain a chance to rewrite the final chapter of his career.

He at last took the gavel of the Armed Services Committee, an assignment he had long coveted. His prominent position was seen as one reason he ran for re-election in 2016.

But he knew his time was limited.

"Every single day," McCain told The New York Times in 2015, "is a day less that I am going to be able to serve in the Senate."

Still, despite saying he was "older than dirt," McCain made few concessions to his age. Even after turning 80, he maintained a punishing schedule of world travel, conferring with top leaders and heading to war zones in trips that left his younger congressional colleagues exhausted.

He would blitz Sunday talk shows, direct from Arizona in the dawn hours. When Trump was elected, McCain took it upon himself to reassure world leaders, visiting multiple countries in the first six months of 2017 before his diagnosis.

His sidekick, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told CNN the hectic pace had taken a toll.

"You know he just wore himself out traveling all around the world," Graham said.

McCain, who was divorced from his first wife, Carol, in 1980, is survived by his wife, Cindy, and seven children, including three sons who continued the family tradition of serving in the armed forces and a daughter, Meghan, who is a presenter on ABC's "The View." His mother, Roberta, aged 106, is also still living.

For his military service, he was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, a Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

He faced his final diagnosis with characteristic courage, telling CNN's Jake Tapper that "every life has to end one way or another."

Asked how he wanted to be remembered, McCain said: "He served his country, and not always right -- made a lot of mistakes, made a lot of errors -- but served his country, and, I hope we could add, honorably."

McCain, who will be remembered as much for his combative nature as his political achievements, summed up the meaning of a life forged in the example of his political hero Theodore Roosevelt when McCain stood before the flag-draped coffin of his friend and foe, Sen. Kennedy, in 2009.

His late colleague from Massachusetts died from the same form of brain cancer that eventually killed McCain. Both men died on August 25.

__label__politics Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in her opening statement, appealed to Republicans to give Democrats more time to review the recently released documents before continuing with today's hearing.

"I really regret this, but I think you have to understand the frustration on this side of the aisle," Feinstein said.

"Every one on this side of the aisle wants to do a good job," Feinstein added. "They want time to be able to consider what the findings are and there are tens of thousands of pages of emails and other items which could institute findings on a whole host of major subjects that this nominee may be faced with, and they're serious."

"It's not to create a disruption," she explained. "It's not to make this a very bad process. It is to say, 'Majority, give us the time to do our work so that we can have a positive and comprehensive hearing on the man who may well be the deciding vote for many of Americans' futures."
__label__politics President Trump attacked Richard Cordray, a Democrat who is running for governor in Ohio, and re-upped his Pocahontas nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

“He was groomed by Pocahontas,” Trump said.

The President continued, “He was groomed by Elizabeth Warren, his name is Cordray and he’s trouble ... a guy that is real trouble.”

Some background: Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, has been a biting critic of Trump for some time. Trump has responded by repeatedly trying to belittle her as "Pocahontas."

Warren says she is Native American and points to "family stories" passed down to her through generations as evidence. One genealogist, following Warren’s account, traced her Native American heritage to the late 19th century, which, if true, would make her 1/32 Native American. (However, the legitimacy of those findings has been debated.)
__label__politics Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum will win the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida, CNN projects, scoring a major victory for the party's progressive wing while taking another step toward becoming the state's first black chief executive.

Backed by Bernie: Backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a coalition of progressive groups, Gillum upset former Rep. Gwen Graham who led in the polls for most of the campaign. He outlasted a field of five competitive candidates, in which he was the only non-millionaire — and only supporter of "Medicare for all" single-payer health care.

Democrats in the race, including billionaire Jeff Greene and the wealthy former Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine, spent more than $100 million for the chance to wrest back control of the governor's mansion, which has been in Republican hands for two decades. Gillum got a late boost when liberal megadonors Tom Steyer and George Soros led a group that donated $650,000 to his affiliated political action committee.

As the primary neared, progressive groups — Indivisible Action, The Collective PAC, The New Florida Vision PAC and the Sanders-inspired Our Revolution among them — banded together to invest an additional $3.5 million in get out the vote efforts supporting Gillum, who campaigned as an outspoken critic of the state's controversial "Stand Your Ground" gun law, which he said at a protest earlier this month "has no place in a civilized society."

In a statement Tuesday night, Sanders cheered Gillum's "vision" and cast Gillum as a leader in the broader progressive movement:

"No one person can take on the economic and political elites on their own. Tonight, Floridians joined Andrew in standing up and demanding change in their community. That's what the political revolution is all about and Andrew Gillum is helping to lead it."
__label__politics (CNN) Two massive clouds that have been hanging over Donald Trump's presidency for months broke open almost simultaneously on Tuesday afternoon -- and poured rain all over the President.

Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time, two narratives -- both disastrously bad for Trump -- emerged:

1. Paul Manafort, the man who spent five critical months leading Trump's campaign in 2016, was found guilty of eight financial crimes. On the 10 other charges brought against Manafort, the jury couldn't reach a unanimous conclusion and the presiding judge declared a mistrial on those counts.

2. Longtime Trump personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen agreed to a plea deal with the Southern District of New York in which he admitted guilt on eight charges and acknowledged that he had discussed or made hush payments to two women alleging affairs with Trump in order to keep damaging information from becoming public, at the direction of and in coordination with a candidate for federal office. That candidate, although Cohen didn't name him, is obviously Donald Trump.

Either of these developments could make for a disastrous week for the President of the United States, who has watched special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian 2016 election interference draw ever closer to him as it has gone along. But for both Manafort to be found guilty and Cohen to not only plead guilty but to implicate Trump in a payoff that violates campaign finance law is, literally, catastrophic for the Trump White House.

While both stories are very big deals, the Cohen plea is more important in terms of its direct impact on Trump.

Remember that Cohen has acknowledged discussing or making payments to both porn star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal during the course of the 2016 campaign as a way to ensure their silence about alleged affairs they conducted years earlier with Trump.

Cohen at first insisted that the Daniels payment was made out of his own pocket and without any direct or indirect knowledge by Trump. Of the payoff, Cohen said back in February: "In a private transaction in 2016, I used my own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford. Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."

In a New York City courtroom on Tuesday, Cohen admitted that wasn't true. He said he sought to keep the payments -- as well as their source -- out of the public eye "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office."

And those 12 words are a very, very, very big problem for Donald Trump. Here's why.

In April, Trump was asked about the Stormy Daniels payout by reporters. Here's that exchange:

Reporter: "Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?"

Trump: "No."

Reporter: "Then why did Michael Cohen make [the payment], if there was no truth to her allegations?"

Trump: "You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael's my attorney, and you'll have to ask Michael."

Reporter: "Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?"

Trump: "No I don't know."

We've already learned, thanks to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that Trump paid Cohen back the $130,000 that was funneled through a shell company knows as Essential Consultants LLC to Daniels. But even that admission still gave Trump some level of plausible deniability: Sure, he was regularly paying Cohen a retainer to fix problems, but Trump never knew about any of the details of the payments or what they were for.

Except that's no longer accurate, according to what Cohen said as part of the plea deal. If Cohen was contemplating the payment to Daniels and McDougal at the "direction" of and in "coordination" with Trump, it's impossible for the President's statements made aboard Air Force One back in April to be accurate. Literally impossible.

What that means -- if Cohen's plea is to be taken at face value, which the Southern District of New York quite clearly does -- is that Trump may have not only sought to end-run campaign finance laws in coordination with Cohen in hopes of keeping allegations about his romantic life private but also lied about it.

That. Is. A. Massive. Deal. MASSIVE.

Now, on to Manafort. There was a tendency among some in the immediate aftermath of the ruling to point out two bits of allegedly good news for Manafort/Trump: 1) 10 of the 18 charges had been declared a mistrial and b) the charges all dealt with time long before Manafort came into Trump's orbit.

What that overlooks is that a) Even if the 10 other charges aren't re-tried, Manafort is going to spend years in jail and b) Manafort was Trump's lead campaign operative for an absolutely critical time of Trump's ascent to the presidency.

No matter what Trump says now about how little Manafort did in the campaign or how short a period of time he spent on the campaign, the fact of Manafort's essential role within the campaign is indisputable. And at the very least, Trump's decision to hire Manafort badly undermines the President's oft-repeated promise on the campaign trail that he would only hire the best people in his White House. Trump's former campaign manager has now been found guilty on eight felony charges of financial wrongdoing. You can't just wave that off. Or we shouldn't just wave that off.

I wrote recently that the next two weeks would be an absolutely critical moment for Trump's presidency, for the broader Republican Party and for the country . Now, in the space of a single hour, two massive dominoes have fallen -- and they both landed on Trump. While the Manafort news is more of a glancing blow, the Cohen plea deal is, without question, the biggest problem for Trump personally that has emerged publicly to date. We are talking about the President of the United States being implicated in a purposeful and coordinated attempt to break campaign finance laws. And to do so in service of keeping allegations about his private life out of the public eye during a campaign for the highest office in the land -- an office he won just 11 days after Cohen paid off Daniels.

It's the stuff of nightmares for Trump and his inner circle, sure. But it also poses huge risks for a Republican Party that has largely tolerated Trump's radical presidency in hopes of securing things like long-term conservative dominance on the Supreme Court or a tax cut law. What can or will the congressional leaders within the party say -- particularly given that the 2018 midterm election is now less than 100 days away?

This is a day -- and an hour -- the Trump operation and the broader Republican Party has long dreaded, and likely had come to believe might never arrive. But here we are.

The fallout from this most newsy of hours in the Trump presidency will almost certainly transform the political landscape in the coming days and weeks. Most pressingly, Trump or his lawyers need to try to find some way to explain why he insisted he knew nothing about the payment to Daniels when Cohen has said he kept harmful information from becoming public at Trump's -- or a "candidate's" -- behest. But other questions will have to be asked (and answered) quickly as well: Do Republicans stand by Trump? Does impeachment chatter pick up outside of the fringes of the left? How does the always mercurial Trump react on Twitter to what looks like being caught in a blatant lie?

And then of course there remains Mueller and the report he is working on to detail his findings about Russia's interference in the 2016 election, the possibility of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and whether or not Trump may have obstructed the investigation being run out of the FBI.

We don't know the hour -- or the day -- the Mueller report will be released. But that may be the only hour that could eclipse the disastrous 60 minutes Trump endured on Tuesday.
__label__politics (CNN) Motel 6 has reached a tentative agreement in a lawsuit that claims it discriminated against some of its Latino guests and violated their privacy, a civil rights group says.

The suit says two Phoenix locations of the hotel chain gave details of at least seven guests' whereabouts and handed other personal information over to federal immigration agents before the guests got arrested.

The claim was filed by a Latino civil rights group, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The suit also alleges Motel 6 has a practice of giving guests' check-in information to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement without a warrant or a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is going on. Turning over their information to ICE is a violation of their privacy, the suit says.

Motel 6 has agreed to settle the suit, but it's subject to a federal judge's approval.

__label__politics American Airlines and United Airlines both told the federal government to stop using their planes to transport children who have been separated from their families at the US-Mexico border, after a Facebook post went viral claiming they were doing just that.

American said it has no way of knowing for sure whether its aircraft has been used to transport migrant children who have been separated from their families, and United said research failed to reveal any evidence separated children were being flown on their planes.

Still, stories of distressed migrant children being transported on airplanes were spreading, and the airlines chose to respond.

How the government is responding: The Department of Homeland Security criticized the airlines' requests to not partner with the agency, saying the partnership was a way to "swiftly reunite unaccompanied illegal immigrant children with their families." Tyler Houlton, press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, also tweeted, “Despite being provided facts on this issue, these airlines clearly do not understand our immigration laws and the long-standing devastating loopholes that have caused the crisis at our southern border.”

How all of this started

The news coverage of the border crisis and family separations has included stories of wailing cries from children asking for their parents, harsh living conditions and understaffed facilities, sparking waves of outrage against the policy.

But then a Facebook post began circulating last week that claims to be the story of a flight attendant on an unnamed airline who watched 16 migrant children dressed in Walmart sweats board a flight from Arizona to Miami just after midnight.

CNN has not confirmed the veracity of the Facebook claim.

__label__world (CNN) British baking giant Warburton's has been forced to pause production of crumpets at two of its factories amid the ongoing carbon dioxide (CO2) crisis.

The UK's largest producer of crumpets had no choice but to halt output after it ran out of the gas, which it uses in its packaging to extend the shelf life of the product.

Similar to English muffins, crumpets are a staple of the British breakfast table or afternoon tea -- small savory griddle cakes that are toasted and doused in butter.

"As a result of the ongoing CO2 shortage, we are producing nowhere near the 1.5 million packs of crumpets we usually make each week and have had to suspend production at a number of our bakeries," said Tearmh Taylor, corporate and consumer affairs manager at Warburtons.

"This will remain the case until the CO2 supply returns to normal. But, rest assured we are working really hard to keep our products on Britain's shelves," she said.

__label__politics (CNN) -- Meghan McCain, a contributor to TheDailyBeast.com, is the daughter of Sen. John McCain and Cindy McCain. But it's her recent verbal sparring with conservative Republicans that's put her in the spotlight.

Meghan McCain tells Larry King on Monday night: "I'm not going to be bullied around about my weight."

In a wide-ranging interview on Monday on CNN's "Larry King Live," McCain discussed her thoughts on President Obama, her recent heated exchange with radio host Laura Ingraham, her tattoos and more.

The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:

Larry King: [President Obama] is taking some criticism for smiling and laughing [during his "60 Minutes" interview.] Are you one of those critics?

Meghan McCain: You know, I actually am not. I think anyone that would possibly think that the president is not taking the economy seriously -- I just think it's ridiculous. ...

King: [Is President Obama getting overexposed]?

McCain: I think he is on the verge of it. I do think you have to be careful. But it is a different generation. [My] generation ... we like our celebrities. And I think that he realizes that because he is very much a Generation Y president. However, he is on the risk of alienating his older followers.

King: Does Obama seem like the same guy who ran against your dad? How do you view him?

McCain: He's our president and when the election was over and when President Obama won, all negative feelings were gone. I support the president.

King: How does your dad feel about that?

McCain: I think the same way. You know, my family is really good at letting go of things and moving on. And he just holds no grudges.

King: Do you think most of the people in your party agree with [Rush] Limbaugh? Do they want him to fail?

McCain: I don't know, because there are many different personalities within the party. ... I would never want my president to fail, no matter which party is in power.

King: You interviewed the [Louisiana] governor's wife?

McCain: I interviewed [Supyira] Jindal, the first lady of Louisiana. And she's a fascinating woman. She totally impressed me because she was very warm and friendly.

I went down and interviewed her and the piece came out today on TheDailyBeast.com.

King: Do you like him [Gov. Bobby Jindal]?

McCain: I do. You know, we do veer off on some things politically, but any leader that I'm going to have I'm going to veer off politically.

King: Do you consider yourself a moderate? Are you moderate liberal?

McCain: I consider myself a progressive Republican. I am liberal on social issues. And I think that the party is at a place where social issues shouldn't be the issues that define the party. And I have taken heat, but in fairness to me, I am a different generation than the people that are giving me heat. I'm 24 years old. I'm not in my 40s, I'm not in my 50s and older.

King: Therefore, you must, based on what you said, disagree with your father? ... Do you discuss it?

McCain: We have a very big generation gap between me and my father. Yes, we discuss them. He's very open-minded. I was raised in an open-minded home. I was raised a Christian, but I was raised open-minded Christian -- one to accept people, love people, not pass judgment. ...

I believe in gay marriage. ... I personally am pro-life, but I'm not going to judge someone that's pro-choice. It is not my place to judge other people and what they do with their body.

King: We have an e-mail question from Veronica, Huntington Park, California: "Do you share most of your father's political views?"

McCain: When it comes to war and the economy, and many fiscal conservative values, I agree with him. I mean I fell in love with the Republican Party because of my father.

King: Earlier this month, [you] wrote a DailyBeast column criticizing right-wing pundit Ann Coulter. Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham fired back at you, including making a comment about your weight. You then gave a straight talk response in an appearance on "The View." What led to that?

McCain: You know, it's so funny. I was in the airport today and this guy goes, "Hey, Meghan, kiss my fat ass." And I was like oh my gosh. That's where this has gone to.

As far as I'm concerned with what's going on with Laura Ingraham, on my end, it's over. There are nine million women in this country suffering from eating disorders. And I'm not going to be bullied around about my weight and what kind of standards I'm not fitting. ...

King: Were you surprised that Laura, who's had breast cancer, got into something that personal?

McCain: I had never heard of her before until this happened.

King: You didn't know her?

McCain: No. I'm not familiar with her work. But I hope she doesn't do it again.

King: What about Ann Coulter?

McCain: She didn't respond, which is fine with me. ... All I wanted to do is show women that you don't have to be Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham to have a place in the Republican Party. ... Supriya Jindal is a good role model, but a lot of people hadn't heard of her.

And I just want to show that you don't have to think one way and fit into this one box in order to be a member of the Republican Party.

King: Were [your parents] angry at Laura Ingraham?

McCain: My mother was. She's a very protective mama bear.

King: Are you a tattooer?

McCain: I have one. My brothers have a lot of tattoos. I love tattoos. I do. I know, you never would have thought me, right? But I do.

King: No. You don't look like a tattooer. What do your folks think of that?

McCain: I've got supportive parents, you know. My mom thinks it's cute. ... I have a little star on my foot.

King: What kind of dad is your father?

McCain: He's great. I love my dad so much. He's the best father to me. And like I said, he's so supportive of me and my career and what I do and speaking my mind.

When you grow up having a maverick as a father and an example, you can understand how I turned out like this.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates is finalizing a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller's office, indicating he's poised to cooperate in the investigation, according to sources familiar with the case.

Gates has already spoken to Mueller's team about his case and has been in plea negotiations for about a month. He's had what criminal lawyers call a "Queen for a Day" interview, in which a defendant answers any questions from the prosecutors' team, including about his own case and other potential criminal activity he witnessed.

Gates' cooperation could be another building block for Mueller in a possible case against President Donald Trump or key members of his team.

Once a plea deal is in place, Gates would become the third known cooperator in Mueller's sprawling probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It would also increase the pressure to cooperate on Gates' co-defendant Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, who has pleaded not guilty to Mueller's indictment and is preparing for a trial on alleged financial crimes unrelated to the campaign. Gates pleaded not guilty on October 30 alongside Manafort.

"Nobody (who's charged) goes in to provide incriminating information to the government unless it's part of plea negotiations," said a criminal defense attorney who represents a witness in the case. In a Queen for a Day interview, a defendant can typically admit to crimes with little additional consequences, unless he or she lies.

After the interview, there's a very small chance a defendant could turn back toward fighting the charges, according to several lawyers who specialize in federal criminal cases.

The White House sees little sign that Gates' cooperation could pose any risk to the President. "There'd be no anxiety here" if Gates cooperated with Mueller in exchange for a plea deal, one White House official said.

It's still unclear what Gates, who outlasted Manafort in the campaign and later worked on the Trump inaugural efforts, could share that would be of value to the Russian collusion investigators, outside the Manafort case. The value of what a defendant says factors into the plea negotiation as both sides finalize the deal.

After an interview, prosecutors typically investigate the information a defendant provides. They then negotiate the defendant's ultimate charges or potential sentence.

Gates' plea deal could be announced in the next few days, given that he's asked a judge for an extension until Wednesday to discuss his in-flux legal representation.

At the same time, investigators with the special counsel's office are preparing to file new charges against him, according to people familiar with the probe. The additional charges are tax-related, these people say, which could increase the fines and prison time Gates faces in court. More charges are also being prepared against Manafort related to his work before he joined the Trump campaign, according to another source familiar with the case.

The threat of new charges could be used in the negotiation to pressure Gates into cooperating and pleading. With his current set of eight charges, Gates could face 10 or more years in prison if found guilty.

The options in a criminal case are "either trial or plea," said Brian Stolarz, a white collar lawyer who specializes in federal cases. "You have to have the heart, the stomach and the wallet to proceed with the trial."

Signs of cooperation

Several developments of the past months have pointed to Gates pursuing a different path than a trial -- from Gates' lack of focus in court on fighting the charges to his financial situation at home.

His court case since then has barely focused on trial preparations, which Judge Amy Berman Jackson noted in court on Wednesday as she urged the lawyers to set a trial date.

Gates' legal team quibbled over his bail terms and house arrest for more than two months after his indictment. Recently, they've been focused on a question of who will represent him in court. The three trial lawyers who took on Gates' case shortly after his indictment asked to part ways with their client on February 1. The legal team drama culminated in two long sealed hearings in front of the judge last week and on Wednesday. The two-and-a-half hours spent on that topic suggest the lawyers' situation with Gates is more complicated than a typical attorney changeover.

Working separately from Gates' trial lawyers is the well-known Washington defense attorney Thomas Green. Green, who has known Mueller personally for years, is negotiating Gates' plea deal, according to people familiar with the case. He has visited the special counsel's office multiple times in the last several weeks. Green appeared with Gates yesterday in court, but is not handling his trial situation.

Green did not respond to requests for comment. Two other attorneys for Gates declined to comment.

Gates -- without using an attorney -- asked the judge this week if he could wait until February 21 to clear up his attorney issue with the court.

Aside from the legal maneuvering, the father of four has faced personal and financial pressure to bring his legal proceedings to a speedy resolution, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Gates has told associates he had hoped for outside assistance from a legal defense fund, but deep-pocketed GOP donors have shown little interest in helping either Gates or Manafort cover their legal fees, two sources said.

The judge has already acknowledged that Gates could not show he had $5 million in assets to secure his bail. His financial situation is further hampered by assets he would have to forfeit to the government if found guilty of money laundering charges. A complex criminal case such as this could cost a defendant more than a million dollars in legal fees, especially if he were to go to trial, according to several people familiar with the legal industry.

The stress has taken a toll on Gates' young family, who have urged him to do what is necessary to conclude these proceedings, a source said. Gates lives in Richmond, Virginia, with his wife and four children.

White House downplays significance

Privately, Trump has expressed sympathy for both Manafort and Gates, believing that the only reason they are in legal jeopardy is because Trump associates have been unfairly targeted in a Russia probe the President has deemed a "witch hunt."

"If Gates cooperates against Manafort that's nothing to us," the White House official said. "They have a hard case to make against Manafort. That's why Gates might get favorable treatment."

The charges against Manafort and Gates center on work they did for Russia-sympathetic politicians in Ukraine between 2006 and 2015. Federal prosecutors said they earned tens of millions of dollars from that work, which they then allegedly laundered through US and foreign companies and bank accounts.

Manafort faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of nine charges and is still under house arrest. His attorney has pledged to fight the charges, and has even sued Mueller and the Justice Department for overreaching the purpose of their investigation with this case.

Manafort and Gates were at the helm of the campaign during the critical summer 2016 period when senior campaign officials, including Manafort, met a group of Russians at Trump Tower who had promised damaging information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. They were also in charge during the Republican National Convention when a handful of Trump campaign associates met with the Russian ambassador, and when Trump campaign officials intervened to change language on the platform about the Ukraine crisis.

Gates often traveled with Trump during the campaign and grew close to other top advisers. When Manafort was ousted from the campaign in August 2016, Gates' role was diminished, and he later stepped away from the campaign. But he remained in the Trump orbit and worked as a senior official for Trump's inaugural committee.

The White House believes Mueller is primarily interested in information Gates can provide about his long business history with Manafort rather than activities related to the presidential campaign or transition.
__label__politics (CNN) Summer's almost over and you still can't decide what you should be reading on the beach?

Don't worry. Let the 44th and 45th Presidents of the United States be your guides.

Barack Obama put out a short list of books he's been reading.

"This summer I've been absorbed by new novels, revisited an old classic, and reaffirmed my faith in our ability to move forward together when we seek the truth," Obama wrote in a Facebook post Sunday.

The books Obama recommended are:

-- "Educated" by Tara Westover, a memoir about a woman who leaves her survivalist Idaho roots behind;

-- "Warlight" by Michael Ondaatje, a post-World War II novel that Obama says is "a meditation on the lingering effects of war on family;"

-- "An American Marriage" by Tayari Jones, about a newlywed black attorney wrongly convicted of rape;

-- "Factfulness" a tome by Swedish academic Hans Rosling on the "secret silent miracle of human progress," and;

-- "A House for Mr. Biswas," considered to be the first, great novel by the late V.S. Naipaul.

Obama also put out a reading list back in June, which included works such as "The New Geography of Jobs" and "Why Liberalism Failed."

Trump's list

President Trump said he doesn't have much time to read these days, but he's been making book recommendations on Twitter.

There's a common theme among the books that have Trump's approval. They either focus on the President in a positive light or have been authored by Trump supporters, friends or anchors on his favorite channel, Fox News.

The list of books Trump has recommended this year include:

-- "The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump," by Gregg Jarrett. Trump lauded this book as "hard work" from Jarrett, a Fox News legal analyst who Trump called "a brilliant guy."

-- "The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President," by Sean Spicer. "A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book," Trump wrote, adding that the account from his former White House press secretary is a "story told with both heart and knowledge."

-- "9 Rules of Engagement," by Harris Faulkner. Trump praised this memoir by Fox News anchor Faulkner as a "terrific new book."

-- "The Capitalist Comeback: The Trump Boom and the Left's Plot to Stop It," by Andy Puzder. Trump gave a nod to his former labor secretary nominee Puzder's new book, predicting that it will be a "big hit."
__label__politics Phoenix (CNN) He rarely showed it in his public life, but John McCain spent a lot of time thinking about this moment -- when he would face his final judgment before God.

As his closest friends have often noted this week, he was a man of great contradictions: a playboy fighter pilot turned hero, a romantic and cynic, and as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said, a man who came to accept that his honor and his imperfections would always be in conflict.

Through all of his internal struggles with his mistakes or regrets, it was his quiet faith that sustained him. Few knew that the Episcopalian, who refused to flaunt his faith on the campaign trail, could quote Scripture at length and served as the "room chaplain" to his fellow prisoners of war in North Vietnam.

His own religious awakening began in that prison and the path ended here in Phoenix at his wife's Baptist church, where McCain developed a deep belief in forgiveness and God's grace.

Those touchstones that provided solace to McCain throughout his life are threaded through the religious services that begin today at North Phoenix Baptist Church, and continue at the Washington National Cathedral Saturday, culminating with a private ceremony at the US Naval Academy where he will be buried Sunday in a plot overlooking the Severn River.

The readings McCain chose encapsulate the lessons he strove to impart: duty, sacrifice, honor, bi-partisanship, service to one's country and a commitment to a cause greater than one's self.

But they also include the prayers that carried him through his torment as a prisoner of war, and helped him through his life journey as he sought to reconcile his mistakes with his heroic public image.

I did a long interview with then-presidential-candidate McCain about his faith on his campaign plane in April of 2008. Though I'd traveled with him for many months, starting in snowy New Hampshire when he was at the bottom of the pack and had endless hours to talk to reporters, his religion was still a curiosity to me.

Unlike other politicians I had covered, he shied away from using his faith to his political advantage, even as he struggled to win over evangelical voters.

I knew he was voracious reader, but was startled as we talked by how effortlessly he quoted Scripture. He explained that prayer and church had been an ingrained part of his life in high school, where he attended chapel each morning and Sunday evenings.

It wasn't until his plane was shot down over Hanoi that he began to rely on his faith. In solitary confinement, he has written that he prayed "more often and more fervently than I ever had as a free man."

His longtime friend Charlie Black, a pallbearer today at North Phoenix Baptist Church, recalled talking to McCain about how he somewhat reluctantly became the "room chaplain" for his fellow prisoners.

"When he was out of solitary (his captors) wouldn't give him a Bible, so he would come up with verses from memory that they could study together," Black recalled in an interview Wednesday.

McCain told me that he was "very slow in maturing." He said he knew right from wrong, the Bible, the Nicene Creed and the Apostles' Creed, and the tenets of his faith, but neglected them until that five-and-a-half year period in Hanoi.

"The time came that I could fall back on them as a net, as a way of salvation," McCain said in the 2008 interview. It was the same period, as former Sen. Jon Kyl noted at the Arizona State Capitol service Wednesday, that McCain "fell in love with his country when he was a prisoner in another." Faith and his ideal of "Country First" became intertwined.

In captivity, McCain urged his fellow prisoners not to pray for their release or their own personal success.

That stayed with him. "I pray to do the right thing so I won't look back in regret or embarrassment or even shame that I betrayed my principles and my faith," he told me in 2008.

He found a home at Cindy McCain's church in Phoenix, where he came to love his pastor's message about grace: "that we're all sinners, but we can benefit from God's grace if we recognize those sins and move forward," he said.

That idea is woven through some of the Bible verses he chose for today's service and those this weekend, particularly in 2 Timothy 4:6-8 that will be read by his son Andrew McCain:

"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."

The inclusion of those verses, Graham said, gave him the most comfort that his friend was satisfied with the life that he led and had apologized for his mistakes.

"The public John McCain felt the need to reconcile his imperfections," Graham said, citing McCain's position change on the Confederate flag as an example. "The private John McCain was reassured that you can be forgiven."

In their totality, the readings and prayers in all the services represent "a Christian message," Black said. "Always trying, never quitting and trying follow the golden rules."

In Saturday's service at the National Cathedral, the messages of humility, selflessness, taking a stand against oppression -- a theme in former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte's reading from Wisdom 3:1 "The Destiny of the Righteous" --- and putting country before one's self, are also an implicit contrast to the values of the current President, said former McCain strategist Steve Schmidt.

Before his death, McCain pointedly made it known that President Donald Trump was not invited to the services commemorating his life.

"Even in death he's provoked one last fight, forced once last conversation, a choice in oppositional virtues," said Schmidt, who infuriated McCain by speaking in derogatory terms about his running mate Sarah Palin after the 2008 presidential campaign.

"Trump is his analogue," Schmidt said, "Valor to cowardice, sacrifice to self-interest, service to greed." He noted the vast international interest in McCain's life that has been evident in recent days: "People see in McCain what they like about America: the traditions of our country, the values of our country."

In the last months of his life, McCain's friends took comfort in the various iterations of the refrain he came back to again and again in their private conversations: "I wasn't cheated."

From the program of the services, they also see the friend who felt the pressure of living up to the example of his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, and the man who wrote in one of his memoirs that he tried to live a life of balance "between pride and regret, between liberty and honor."

On Saturday at the National Cathedral, McCain's son Jimmy -- who followed the family's military tradition by enlisting in the US Marine Corps -- will read the poem McCain loved, Requiem by Robert Louis Stevenson.

McCain's longtime co-author and close friend Mark Salter noted that the Arizona senator read it at his own father's funeral: "It was sort of a code for him."

With Jimmy's reading, McCain's family's military tradition will come full circle. And it is classic McCain, his friends said, a "poet warrior" and romantic to the end.

Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, And I laid me down with a will. This be the verse you grave for me: Here he lies where he longed to be; Home is the sailor, home from sea, And the hunter home from the hill.
__label__politics (CNN) A parting lesson in American civility from Sen. John McCain lies in the roster of leaders he personally selected to pay tribute at his memorial service Saturday at the National Cathedral.

It was a day in early April when Barack Obama received an unexpected call from McCain, who was battling brain cancer and said he had a blunt question to ask: Would you deliver one of the eulogies at my funeral?

Obama, who is responsible for extinguishing McCain's second bid for the White House a decade ago, immediately answered that he would. He was taken aback by the request, aides say, as was George W. Bush, another former rival, who received a similar call from McCain this spring.

When the 43rd and 44th US presidents stand on the high altar of the soaring cathedral on Saturday, after the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" anthem is sung, they will not only be celebrating the life of John Sidney McCain III. It will be McCain, too, having a not-so-subtle last word, aimed at another president he made clear he did not want to attend: Donald J. Trump.

While neither of the two former presidents were especially close to McCain in life, he and Bush were fellow Republicans, forged together for better or worse, through policy and party loyalty. After a deeply personal and vitriolic primary fight in 2000, McCain went on to endorse Bush and occasionally campaigned with him four years later.

But McCain's decision to invite Obama to speak at his funeral stands out as far more extraordinary, given their brutal and bitter rivalry during the 2008 presidential race.

I had a daily ringside seat to their feud, covering the campaign for The New York Times, chronicling their fights over the Iraq war and, later, the economy. On those subjects, and many more, McCain viewed Obama as naïve and unprepared for the presidency. To be clear, those critiques lingered long after Obama won, particularly on matters of national security.

So, I've been wondering whether McCain and Obama had somehow developed an intimate relationship after Obama left office, if they had been having quiet conversations over the last year or two that haven't been publicly discussed as McCain neared the end of his journey.

It turns out, after talking to several friends of both men this week, their relationship isn't intimate at all, but rather one rooted in mutual respect and a shared sense of alarm at today's caustic political climate. Their telephone call on that April day was first arranged by advisers, not McCain simply dialing up Obama as he would do with his legion of friends, a sign they were hardly tight.

In fact, the two have spoken by phone only a couple of times since Obama left the White House, aides to both men say, most notably last summer when Obama reached out after McCain cast the deciding vote to salvage the Affordable Care Act. He thanked him. The call was brief.

Obama has not been among the long parade of visitors who came to see McCain on his Arizona ranch as he fought brain cancer. George and Laura Bush dropped by not long ago, as did former Vice President Joe Biden, a close and longtime friend of McCain's in the Senate, who will deliver a eulogy at a memorial service on Thursday in Arizona.

But McCain's decision to ask Obama and Bush to eulogize him is part of a carefully choreographed -- and, yes, even strategic -- message for America and the world in the wake of his death. It's also perhaps, one last opportunity for McCain to try and tamp down a fervor that first awoke in the Republican Party during his 2008 race and has swelled ever since.

'A lesson in civility'

Steve Duprey, a longtime friend of McCain's and a senior adviser in his 2008 campaign, said the senator respected Obama, even if the two were never particularly close and wounds from their race were raw for years.

"I think it is John McCain imparting a lesson in civility by asking the two men who defeated him to speak, as an example to America that differences in political views and contests shouldn't be so important that we lose our common bonds and the civility that is, or used to be, a hallmark of American democracy," Duprey said.

David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama in his campaigns and in the White House, said the clear message McCain is sending is "about our shared heritage, our shared trust of this democracy that transcends party and transcends tribe."

"It really does animate his message of national unity," Axelrod said. "There is a kind of poetry to it that he wanted his two erstwhile opponents to eulogize them."

Even unspoken, the lesson also shines a light on McCain's outward disdain for Trump and his presidency. And McCain hardly shied away from that in a farewell, posthumous message released on Monday in which he echoed his concession speech to Obama from a decade ago.

"Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here," McCain wrote in the statement released after his death. "Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history."

But as the remarkable story of McCain's life has been replaying this week -- his acts of wartime heroism and his admissions of congressional mistakes -- it's striking the degree to which the old quarrels seem almost charming in the era of Trump.

Burying the hatchet

Not mincing words, as McCain rarely did, one of his friends explained it like this: Trump has made it far easier for McCain to bury the hatchet with Bush and Obama.

It was Obama, in particular, who got under McCain's skin long before they faced off in the general election of the 2008 campaign. Their first skirmish happened two years earlier in the halls of the Senate, where McCain blasted Obama for "posturing" on one of his favorite issues: lobbying reform.

"I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party's effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman senator, and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness," McCain wrote in a searing and sarcastic letter to Obama

I was thinking back to that clash this week, which ended three days later as McCain and Obama playfully cocked their fists and mugged for the cameras on Capitol Hill.

Those early dust-ups, of course, grew into full-blown fights on the campaign trail, when McCain aired his long-held observation that Obama was full of himself.

"I don't seek the presidency on the presumption that I am blessed with such personal greatness," McCain said one day in the early stages of their race . "That history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need."

What annoyed McCain the most, of course, was how Obama was steadily capturing the mantle of change and the air of excitement that he once enjoyed aboard his famous campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express.

I was lucky enough to see that for myself when I first met McCain in the fall of 1999, as he was becoming the rising candidate in the Republican primary. At the time, I was a cub reporter for the Des Moines Register. Since McCain's strategy was to skip the Iowa caucuses -- a very wise decision -- I went to find him in New Hampshire and was overwhelmed by his charm.

Charm turned cantankerous

By the 2008 campaign, after I had interviewed McCain many times while covering Congress for the Chicago Tribune and The New York Times, his charm turned cantankerous. McCain snapped at me one day as he returned to Washington to cast a vote, curtly suggesting reporters were treating Obama with kid gloves. He often refused to speak to journalists, but he always had a hard time keeping the punishment up for long because he did like talking -- and promoting -- issues that mattered.

It was Obama, ironically, who was far more reticent around the press. He initially confided to advisers that he was worried about running against such an authentic figure and war hero like McCain, but quickly found a way to agitate his opponent: tying him to Bush.

He did so again and again as they tangled in televised debates during the fall of 2008 in Mississippi, Tennessee and New York and in campaign rallies in all corners of the country.

"I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common," Obama said in a frequent refrain. "Here's the thing, we know what the Bush-McCain philosophy looks like."

All of that, of course, is ancient -- and quaint -- history. Yet it will be front-and-center on Saturday as Bush and Obama, an improbable duo, rise to send off McCain, a rival no more.
__label__politics (CNN) The United States could impose tariffs on roughly half of all Chinese goods entering the country by the end of the week.

President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods could go into effect as soon as Friday when a public comment period on the taxes concludes. It's unclear whether the new tariffs will be set at 10% or 25%.

China is the United States' largest trading partner. Almost $506 billion of Chinese goods were sold in the United States last year. But the tariffs are meant to punish China for what the Trump Administration says are unfair trade practices, such as stealing intellectual property. China has accused the United States of trade bullying.

Beijing has retaliated at each step of the way. It has imposed 25% tariffs on $50 billion of American goods to date. It's also threatened to respond to the newest round with tariffs on another $60 billion of US goods. It's hard for China to match the United States' tariff on $200 billion of goods because the United States exports far less to China.

__label__world (CNN) For months, North Korea has been preparing a massive display of national unity and military might to mark the 70th anniversary of the country's founding.

International journalists have been invited to watch a military parade as it weaves through the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, a torch-lit rally and the Mass Games, a highly choreographed event expected to involved hundreds of thousands of people.

The Mass Games are making a comeback after a five-year hiatus, for reasons that are unclear. It's not a competitive event but a distinctly North Korean piece of performance art similar in size and scale to an Olympic opening ceremony.

North Korea is known for signaling its future intentions and policies by indirect and sometimes opaque methods, so experts will be watching events closely for insight into what leader Kim Jong Un and his top aides are thinking -- especially as negotiations with the US over North Korea's nuclear arsenal appear to have reached a deadlock.

"These milestone anniversaries are an opportunity to give the people something to celebrate, instill a sense of pride and they're also an opportunity to send a message to the outside world," said Jean Lee, the director of the The Wilson Center's Korea Center and a former Pyongyang bureau chief for The Associated Press.

__label__politics (CNN) Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former White House aide and reality TV star, claims in her forthcoming book that President Donald Trump's re-election campaign offered her a lucrative contract in exchange for her signature on a strict non-disclosure agreement after her ouster from the administration last year, according to an excerpt quoted in The Washington Post.

Manigault Newman writes in "Unhinged: An Insider Account of the Trump White House" that she turned down the proposal, which would have barred her from the public criticism she has leveled at Trump since her departure. Lara Trump, a campaign adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, extended the offer to Manigault Newman shortly after White House chief of staff John Kelly fired her for "serious integrity issues," according to The Post's excerpts.

The Trump campaign declined to comment on Manigault Newman's description of the deal Lara Trump supposedly offered her.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Friday dismissed the sensational claims in Manigault Newman's book, which hits shelves on August 14.

"Instead of telling the truth about all the good President Trump and his administration are doing to make America safe and prosperous, this book is riddled with lies and false accusations," Sanders said in a statement. "It's sad that a disgruntled former White House employee is trying to profit off these false attacks, and even worse that the media would now give her a platform, after not taking her seriously when she had only positive things to say about the President during her time in the administration."

__label__world (CNN) Ugandan politician Bobi Wine posted a statement on Facebook Monday detailing physical abuse he says he suffered at the hands of the military.

During his arrest and detention in August, Wine says he was beaten with an iron bar, punched, kicked, hit with pistol butts and had his ears pulled with "something like pliers."

"After some time, I could almost no longer feel the pain. I could only hear what they were doing from a far. My cries and pleas went unheeded. The things they were speaking to me all this while, I cannot reproduce here. Up to now, I cannot understand how these soldiers who I probably had never met before in person could hate me so much," Wine said in the statement.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is an MP and the leader of a youth movement that has rattled the regime of President Yoweri Museveni.

Uganda's ministers of internal affairs, defense and security will hold a press conference Tuesday to address allegations of torture by security forces, deputy national police spokesperson Patrick Onyango said Monday. Museveni previously dismissed allegations that Wine and other opposition politicians were tortured.

The Facebook post is the first detailed statement Wine has made since he arrived in the United States over the weekend. Wine came to the US for medical treatment following "brutal torture" at the hands of Uganda's Special Forces Command, he said in a tweet Saturday upon arriving. CNN has reached out to Uganda's SFC for comment.

"We thank the world for standing with us," Wine said in Saturday's tweet.

Wine was first arrested by the military on August 15 after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election in the Arua municipality. He has been charged with treason for allegedly trying to stone Museveni's convoy. Another 32 opposition politicians have also been charged.

In his Facebook post, Wine said SFC soldiers stormed a hotel where he was staying on August 13 and fatally shot one of his team members. Wine locked himself in a room and listened as soldiers shouted at people and beat them up while searching for him.

"In the wee hours of the morning, the soldiers started breaking doors of the different hotel rooms. With rage, they broke doors, and I knew they would soon come to my room," he said.

Eventually, a soldier beat down his door with an iron bar and another ordered him to his knees at gunpoint, Wine said.

"I put my hands up and just before my knees could reach the floor, the soldier who broke into the room used the same iron bar to hit me. He aimed it at my head and I put up my hand in defence so he hit my arm. The second blow came straight to my head on the side of my right eye. He hit me with this iron bar and I fell down. In no minute, all these guys were on me -- each one looking for the best place to hurt. I can't tell how many they were but they were quite a number," he said.

"They beat me, punched me, and kicked me with their boots. No part of my body was spared. They hit my eyes, mouth and nose. They hit my elbows and my knees. Those guys are heartless!"

They brought him to a car and continued to torture him until he lost consciousness, he said. "They pulled my manhood and squeezed my testicles while punching me with objects I didn't see. They pulled off my shoes and took my wallet, phone and the money I had. As soon as the shoes were off, they started hitting my ankles with pistol butts. I groaned in pain and they ordered me to stop making noise for them. They used something like pliers to pull my ears," he said,

He regained consciousness in a small room with his legs and hands tied together with tight cuffs, bleeding from the nose and ears, he said. Two soldiers entered the room and one of them offered a tearful apology, he said.

From there, he says he was transported to military barracks in northern Uganda, where he was drugged and forced to sign a written statement at the Gulu Police Station, the contents of which he hardly recalls, he said. Then, he was moved to military barracks in Makindye, where he was able to see his wife, lawyers and representatives from the Uganda Human Rights Commission, who made a report of his condition, he said.

"I will never forget the atmosphere in that room -- people started crying upon setting eyes on me. At that point, I could not sit, walk or even stand by myself. I was still swollen and spoke with great difficulty due to chest pains," he said.

On that day, he said he learned that he was due in court on August 23 after being "framed" on weapons charges, and received constant medical attention. "It was clear they wanted me to appear in better shape at the next time of my court appearance and they did everything possible to achieve that."

The weapons charge was withdrawn and he was freed on bail August 27 , paving the way for his departure to the United States.

Wine attempted to travel to the United States on Thursday but was prevented from boarding his flight, one of his attorneys, Erias Lukwago, told CNN. He was taken away in a police vehicle to a government-owned hospital in the capital of Kampala with limited access to his family, the lawyer said. On Friday, Uganda's Police Force said it had prevented Wine from traveling in order to give him a medical checkup to investigate allegations that he was tortured.

Pockets of protests broke out in Kampala on Friday as angry youths took to the streets to protest Wine's arrest.

Kenyan activists and civil society groups protest in solidarity with the Ugandan pop star-turned-lawmaker.

Police and soldiers moved through the city, particularly downtown Kamwokya, where Wine's studio is located, to quell demonstrations by his supporters, who had blocked roads in the neighborhood with rocks and tires.

Musicians around the world, including Chris Martin, Angelique Kidjo and Damon Albarn, joined the campaign to #FreeBobiWine.
__label__politics (CNN) Prosecutors said Friday that they misunderstood text messages used as the basis of a claim that Maria Butina offered to trade sex for access -- an extraordinary admission that threatens to undercut the government's cloak-and-dagger portrayal of the young Russian accused of working to infiltrate American political circles.

The government made the explosive allegation that Butina offered "sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization" in a filing in July -- a claim that has been hotly disputed by her lawyer.

"I want the government's walk back to get as much coverage, as prominently, as their initial false allegation," said Robert Driscoll, Butina's attorney.

The government acknowledged its error in a filing released just before midnight Friday but said there was still reason to question the depth of Butina's commitment to her boyfriend, Paul Erickson. Erickson is a South Dakota conservative political operative who CNN has identified as "U.S. Person 1" in government filings. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

"Even granting that the government's understanding of this particular text conversation was mistaken, other communications and materials in the government's possession (and produced to the defense) call into doubt the defendant's claim that her relationship with U.S. Person 1 is a sufficiently strong tie to ensure her appearance in court to face the charges against her if she is released," according to the government's filing.

Butina has pleaded not guilty to charges that she was acting as an agent for the Russian government since her arrest in July. The about face by the government will likely take away little from the central case against Butina, which is bolstered by extensive communications she exchanged with her mentor, a Kremlin-linked banker, and meetings she had with officials from the National Rifle Association.

But the admission represents a victory for Butina's defense team, which has attempted to soften the 29-year-old's image and win her release from jail.

The accusation first made its way into the public eye eight pages into a July filing from the government that argued Butina was a flight risk and should be detained before trial.

"On at least one occasion, Butina offered an individual other than U.S. Person 1 sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization," prosecutors wrote in that filing, saying it supported the notion that her years-long relationship with Erickson was not legitimate, and merely cover that did "not represent a strong tie to the United States" that would prevent her from fleeing.

The detail quickly jumped to newspaper headlines and cable news banners, and drew a rebuke from Butina's attorney, who demanded in interviews and in federal court that the government offer up their evidence behind the claim.

Butina's initial request to be released from custody was denied by a federal judge in July.

"The impact of this inflammatory allegation, which painted Ms. Butina as some type of Kremlin-trained seductress, or spy-novel honeypot character, trading sex for access and power, cannot be overstated," Driscoll wrote in court documents last month.

By August, the messages relied on by the prosecutors to make the assertion were "eventually produced" to Driscoll, he wrote in a filing, and it "does nothing to support the government's claim."

"The only evidence the government relied on for its explosive claim was an excerpt from an innocuous three-year-old text exchange" sent while in Russia between Butina and a "longtime friend" who ran public relations for the gun rights group she founded, Driscoll said.

After taking Butina's car for an insurance inspection, the man, referred to by his initials, DK, texted Butina, "I don't know what you owe me for this insurance they put me through the wringer," according to the filing.

"Sex. Thank you so much. I have nothing else at all. Not a nickel to my name," Butina replied -- "jokingly" -- her attorney wrote.

Butina later wrote that DK could "ask for anything," adding, "That they hire you?"

The message was a taunt, meant as a "good-humored reminder that he already works for her gun rights organization, as well as advertising agency," Driscoll wrote, demanding that prosecutors withdraw or strike the accusation.

On Friday, prosecutors wrote that their charge that Butina offered to trade sex was based both on a series of text messages with DK "and other information about the relationship between the defendant and DK gained through a review of additional communications between them," though they did not outline any new exchanges.

They added that the one exchange they had misunderstood was not the only piece of evidence undergirding their belief that the relationship would not prevent her from fleeing and said that Butina had also offered to "provide information to the government" in a separate and ongoing fraud case involving Erickson. Erickson has not responded to CNN's request for comment on the fraud allegations.

Butina has also messaged friends about the dating app Tinder and once wrote "let's go have fun with guys," according to court filings.

Prosecutors wrote in the filing that Russian government officials have made six consular visits to Butina while she is behind bars, and the Russian foreign minister has complained about the case on two occasions to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — actions that "confirmed her relationship with, and value to, her own government."

Responding late Sunday to the filing, Butina's attorneys slammed the government for "shamelessly [admitting] it had no factual basis" for the claim and said none of the other evidence that the government said it had bears "any relevance to the initial claim that Maria offered to trade sex for access and power."

"The government's documents do nothing to discredit the sincerity of her relationship with Paul Erickson, and its craze with her sex life has gone too far and transformed into an irrelevant obsession," they wrote.

The defense team on Sunday also alleged that the government had tried to sneak another correction into their Friday filing -- acknowledging that Butina had actually received a type of work visa after her student visa elapsed, not just a tourist visa as the government previously claimed. The government said the mistake was just in the labeling of the visa program, but Butina's defense said the fact "carries a very different implication about her future plans in the United States and undermines the government's fear of her bolting to Russia."

The admissions come amid a separate fight that has hung over the case for weeks -- a proposed gag order that prosecutors want to prevent Butina's attorney from speaking with the press in a way they say could prejudice a jury.

Butina's supporters have in recent weeks taken steps to shift the light in which she is portrayed. A new fundraising website splashes a headshot of Butina smiling over a white and pink background along with the words: "I'm Maria, and I need your help."

And late last month, ABC News obtained a heavily-produced video of Butina and her boyfriend performing a duet of a love song from the Disney movie "Beauty and the Beast," which Driscoll, her lawyer, said underscored the extent of their relationship.

"Having successfully created a false media narrative that this case is more about Maria Butina seducing NRA members and Republicans than its gossamer-thin evidence that Maria was acting on anyone's behalf other than her own, the government now seeks to prevent her and her counsel from even attempting to correct the public record," Butina's attorney wrote in a filing Friday.

Both sides are expected back in court Monday afternoon for a status conference.
__label__world (CNN) "Sang Chol!" 92-year-old Lee Keum-seom exclaimed, as she fell into her long lost son's arms at a holiday resort in North Korea Monday.

Lee had been waiting 68 years for this moment , after the two became separated during the Korean War and became trapped either side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which now splits the two Koreas.

Sang Chol was four when she last saw him. He is now 71, himself an old man. On Monday he sat waiting for Lee's arrival with his daughter-in-law. Lee was joined by her two daughters, who grew up in South Korea.

South Korean Lee Keum-seom, 92, meets with her North Korean son Sang Chol, 71, during a family reunion meeting at the Mount Kumgang resort on the North's southeastern coast on August 20, 2018.

Theirs' was one of multiple emotional family reunions taking place at a resort near Mount Kumgang, where buses full of South Koreans drove early Monday.

They were the 89 lucky families selected from the more than 57,000 who had applied for the reunions, agreed to under the Panmunjom Declaration signed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an historic summit earlier this year.

More than 60% of those seeking reunions are over 80 years old, and are being accompanied on the bus trip north by their children and other relatives.

After the initial tearful reunion was over, Sang Chol showed his mother a photo of her husband, who had been with their son when the couple became separated but has since died.

"This is a photo of my father, mom," Sang Chol said, dissolving into sobs.

Before she left for the bus trip north on Monday, Lee told CNN she had prayed for her son to have a long life so the pair could reunite.

"(My family) in North Korea didn't live long so I prayed for my son's health," she said.

She felt nervous about meeting her now elderly son, after only knowing him as a small child, unsure about where to start catching up on a lifetime spent apart.

"What shall I ask?" she said. "Oh, I should ask him what his father told him about me. His father must have told him about how we got separated and where our house used to be. I should ask him about that."

On seeing him however, there was no hesitation, and the two elderly Koreans embraced each other tightly, both in tears. During the whole reunion, they did not let go of each others' hands.

South Korean participants of the inter-Korean family reunions stand for the national anthem as they undergo a briefing on the eve of the departure for North Korea, at a hotel resort in Sokcho on August 19, 2018.

Long awaited reunions

Lee was one of dozens of South Koreans who gathered Sunday at the Hanwha resort hotel, in Sokcho, south of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which separates the two Koreas, where medical checks were carried out and participants were warned about nuances of visiting North Korea. They're told to avoid saying anything that could be misconstrued, or considered insensitive north of the border.

Participants were applauded by Red Cross workers as they arrived, some in wheelchairs, passing under banners reading "We sincerely congratulate the reunions of the separated families!"

In the hotel there was an air of excitement and tension as they prepared to meet husbands, wives, brothers, sisters and children who are now only vague memories, their faces blurred by time.

They then registered their names and were invited to take a professional family photo in a corner of the lobby. It was then framed for them so they could then take it to North Korea as a gift.

Park Kyung-seo, president of the South Korean Red Cross, told CNN that while he was overjoyed to be assisting in family reunions, the small number of those taking part was a "human tragedy."

"I share fully with the disappointment of those who are not selected so I am trying with North Korean partners to try and find other solutions, huge numbers are waiting, the numbers are very much limited," he said.

"Imagine 73 years long without knowing whether their family members are still alive or passed away -- no news at all. The agony and anger, that's an unthinkable human tragedy."

In a statement Monday, President Moon urged both Koreas to work towards more reunions in future, noting his own family history as the child of North Korean refugees.

"Expanding and expediting the reunion has the utmost priority out of all the humanitarian projects that both Koreas must conduct. The Koreas must more boldly make an effort towards solving the divided families issue," he said. "As a member of a divided family myself, I sympathize deeply with that sadness and pain. There really is no time"

Ahn Seung-chun was headed to North Korea to see family members she's never met. "I applied to see my older brother," he said. "But he passed so I'll never see him now."

"I'm going to see my nephew and my brother's wife," she added. On one hand, I'm sad that I won't see my brother. But on the other hand, I'm happy to meet the nephew. At least I will be meeting a fruit of my father."

Dozens of elderly and frail South Koreans set off for North Korea on August 20 to meet relatives for the first time since they were separated nearly seven decades ago by a war that divided the peninsula and their families.

Bittersweet process

In the decades since the Korean War, the Red Cross has reunited many families but thousands of others have missed out.

As family members age, each delay adds to fears that they'll no longer be around to finally meet with their long lost relatives. More than 75,000 applicants have already passed away since the reunion process began.

One protester attended Sunday's event to voice his elderly father's case for a reunion, after the man was unlucky this round.

"I don't know when he will die. He is beginning to show signs of dementia. Before he loses everything, he wants to go too," Kim Seong-jin said. "But all he can do is to watch through television each time and get hurt."

Amid all the joy and happy scenes on both sides of the border this week, this is the reality for most whose families remain split by the Korean War.

"My father is all alone here in the South. Can you imagine how much he misses his family?" Kim said. "He wants to hear the news of his hometown before he dies."

Legacy of war

The pain felt by the families split by the Korean War is one of the most visible legacies of the conflict which, 68 years after it began, still hasn't technically ended

An armistice agreement which paused fighting in 1953 never became a formal peace treaty, and small skirmishes have happened since on either side of the heavily fortified DMZ, even as North Korea has built up its nuclear armaments and the US has maintained a heavy military presence in the South.

Officially ending the war was a key element of the Panmunjom Declaration, and both North and South have said they are continuing to work towards that goal, even as negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington appear to have stalled.

North Korean state media called on the US to agree to an official end to the war last week, saying it was a "preliminary and essential process to pave the ground for detente and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula."

"The U.S. should implement phased and simultaneous measures, like the end-of-war declaration, to build mutual trust and make a breakthrough in the security of the world," state media Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary.

The Unified Korea delegation enters the stadium during the opening ceremony of the Asian Games 2018 at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium on August 18, 2018 in Jakarta, Indonesia.

As well as the family reunions, Saturday saw the fulfillment of another commitment made by Moon and Kim, as a joint Korean team marched in the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.

That move came after a unified Korean team took part in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea earlier this year, negotiations over which helped kick start a breakthrough in North-South relations and lead to the current detente on the Peninsula.

__label__world New Delhi (CNN) India's Supreme Court has struck down a colonial-era law criminalizing consensual gay sex, overturning more than 150 years of anti-LGBT legislation.

The court announced the landmark verdict in Delhi on Thursday, as jubilant crowds cheered and rights activists hugged one another, overcome with emotion.

Section 377, an archaic law imposed during British rule that penalized intercourse "against the order of nature," had carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

The decision to repeal the law is a major victory for India's LGBT activists and supporters after years of determined struggle.

"I can't even explain how I am feeling right now. The long battle has been won. Finally we have been recognized by this country," said Bismaya Kumar Raula, wiping away tears outside the court.

Others gathered said that, while they had anticipated a positive outcome, the result still came as a shock.

"It's an emotional day for me. It's a mix of feelings, it's been a long fight," said rights campaigner Rituparna Borah. "There was not enough media or society support earlier but we have it now. People will not be seen as criminals anymore."

Though the law was rarely enforced in full, lawyers argued that it helped perpetuate a culture of fear and repression within the LGBT community.

A change in legislation will "create a space of freedom where you can start expecting justice," Danish Sheikh, a law professor at Jindal Global Law School and LGBT advocate, told CNN.

Indian LGBT activists in Mumbai react to the news that the Supreme Court has struck down Section 377.

Long battle

Thursday's historic ruling is the culmination of a lengthy and often fraught legal battle for equality in a country where homosexuality remains taboo.

In 2009, the Delhi High Court ruled that the ban on consensual gay sex violated fundamental rights. The decision, which only applied to the Delhi region, was quickly overruled by the Supreme Court in 2013 , following a petition launched by a loose coalition of Christian, Hindu and Muslim groups.

In its 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court said that only a "minuscule fraction of the country's population constitute lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders" and it was therefore "legally unsustainable" to repeal the act.

During the latest hearings, lawyers representing more than a dozen gay and lesbian Indians questioned the constitutional basis of that earlier ruling.

"It was a wrong judgment. It was not legal and it was based wrongly on the tenets of the constitution," said Colin Gonsalves, one of the lawyers representing the current group of petitioners.

That case was strengthened last year, when the Supreme Court moved to uphold the constitutional right to privacy

The ruling, which declared sexual orientation to be an "essential attribute of privacy," helped galvanize campaigners.

"Last year's ruling eviscerated the 2013 judgment," said Gonsalves. "There is no issue now. There is not much left to argue," he added.

Opposition to moves to overturn Section 377 had rested predominately on religious and moral objections. In an interview earlier this year, lawmaker Subramanian Swamy, a prominent member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), described the legalization of gay sex as a "danger to national security" and "against Hindutva."

Hinduism has traditionally maintained a flexible, non-prescriptive view of sexuality. However, in recent years hardline Hindu groups have taken a more conservative approach.

In the run up to the judgment, the BJP refrained from taking a public stand, deferring instead to the court.

Crowds in Mumbai cheer the Supreme Court announcement.

Dehumanizing colonial law

Out of the estimated 48 former British colonies that criminalize homosexuality, 30 still have laws based on the original colonial anti-LGBT legislation, according to Lucas Mendos, co-author of the 2017 International LGBTI Association "State-Sponsored Homophobia" report.

In the case of India, the original British law had remained in place more or less unchanged since it was introduced by British colonizers in the 1860s.

According to India's National Record Bureau, more than 2,100 cases were registered under the law in 2016 . India did not maintain a separate database of prosecution under section 377 until 2014.

Arif Jafar, one of the current group of petitioners whose case the Supreme Court ruled on, was arrested in 2001 under Section 377 and spent 49 days in jail.

Jafar now runs an informal support group in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The group, named "Trust," provides counseling, support and sexual health services to gay and transgender persons.

In his petition, Jafar described the experience as dehumanizing and a violation of his fundamental rights. He also alleged that he was beaten and humiliated every day because of his sexuality.

LGBT supporters in Mumbai react to the Supreme Court ruling that gay sex is no longer a criminal offence.

Campaigners in India pointed out that the law didn't only trap members of the LGBT community in the closet, it also invited other forms of discrimination, providing a cover for blackmail and harassment.

"The constant fear of 377 we have felt will not be there for the coming generation," said Yashwinder Singh, of Mumbai-based LGBT rights group The Humsafar Trust.

"Laws getting passed is one thing but changing the society is a big challenge," said Singh of the court's decision, Thursday.

"Our work has started multifold now. We have to go and talk to people and change their mindset so that they accept every human as one."

Following the announcement Thursday, the Congress Party, the country's main opposition, posted a message of congratulations on social media, welcoming the "progressive and decisive verdict" from the Supreme Court.

We join the people of India & the LGBTQIA+ community in their victory over prejudice. We welcome the progressive & decisive verdict from the Supreme Court & hope this is the beginning of a more equal & inclusive society. #Section377 pic.twitter.com/Fh65vOn7h9 — Congress (@INCIndia) September 6, 2018

As supporters celebrate the decision, activists will now be shifting focus to the broader issue of equality.

"The next step is to start looking at issues of rights. Right now, it is just decriminalizing," Anjali Gopalan, founder of the Naz Foundation, which has spearheaded the fight against Section 377, told CNN.

"The right that every citizen of the country should have access to and should not be taken for granted. Like the right to marry, the right to adopt, the right to inherit. Things that no one questions and that are clearly denied to a certain section of citizens."

Former Attorney General Eric Holder: Politicians should not pick their voters

(CNN) Federal judges said Tuesday that North Carolina will have to quickly redraw its 13 congressional districts because the map is unconstitutionally partisan.

The three-judge panel rejected the previous map drawn by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, saying it violates the Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment, and Article I of the Constitution.

The judges gave the state about three weeks to file a new plan with the court so it will be in place before the 2018 midterms

The opinion is the first federal court ruling to strike down a congressional map as representing a partisan gerrymander.

In 2016 two districts in North Carolina were struck down because judges said the map was racially discriminatory.

__label__world Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) Ghufron Arifuddin's New Year resolution is to clean up the garbage that blights his backyard and neighborhood in Jakarta.

The reason? Snakes.

Twice in the past four months he has found the creatures slithering around in the backyard of his home in East Jakarta, most recently on New Year's Eve when he discovered a 1.5 meter-long (five foot) venomous cobra.

"I was so startled," said Arifuddin, 49, adding that he never saw snakes when he first moved in several years ago.

Snake encounters in the Indonesian capital are becoming more commonplace for several reasons, experts say. Natural habitats are dwindling as Indonesia urbanizes, while poor trash disposal in the sprawling city of 9.5 million means snakes and people are finding themselves in closer contact than ever before.

Trash thrown into a riverbank at a slum in Jakarta on January 10, 2018.

Cobra in a corner

Men like Freddy Hanggoro are all too familiar with snakes inside a home or workplace.

He's a member of the Sioux Snake Rescue, a community of snake enthusiasts that finds itself handling a growing number of calls from residents unnerved by encounters with snakes. He says he gets a call at least once every few days.

In 2017, the 150-member volunteer group said it had rescued more than 130 snakes from people's homes. The year before, the group caught around 90.

A python found on the street at Halim, Jakarta causes a traffic jam on 8 December, 2016.

Recently, he and a friend traveled 20 kilometers, snake hook in tow, to a factory in Bekasi, West Java -- a suburban city on the outskirts of Jakarta.

After sweeping the factory floor they found a venomous cobra coiled in one corner. He put the snake in a small fabric bag made of soft, porous material and tied it.

"We release it somewhere far away from the populated area, to prevent another conflict in the future," he said.

"It can be dangerous if a person mishandles the snake," he added.

He adds that it's particularly common to find snakes during the monsoon between November and March, when heavy rains cause floods that wash snakes out from their hiding places.

The biggest snake the group has caught was a six-meter (20-foot) python in the Kembangan area of West Jakarta in 2016. It was hidden in the ceiling of a house.

'All about the food chain'

Sioux Snake Rescue came about in 2009 as an offshoot of the Sioux Snake Indonesia foundation, which was founded by Aji Rachmat six years earlier with the initial intention of educating people about snakes.

In Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, it's common to find people leaving garbage right outside their homes, especially in low-income areas, Rachmat said.

And the piled-up garbage attracts rats and mice, staple food for snakes such as cobras and pythons.

"If their food can be found around people's homes, that's where they go," he explained. "It's all related, because in the end it's all about the food chain," said Rachmat.

Dwindling forest habitats may also have forced snakes to find ways to survive in urban environments, Rachmat adds

According to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Indonesia loses around 684,000 hectares of forest area every year. This is mainly caused by illegal logging, forest fires from improper palm oil production practices and forest conversions for new palm oil plantations.

Highly adaptive

Amir Hamidi, the head of the herpetology division at Indonesia's Institute of Science, a government research agency, says some snake species such as pythons are highly adaptive and can live both in the forest and in the city.

A team from Sioux Snake Rescue catches a snake in Jakarta.

Hamidi warned that snakes will continue to show up in people's homes unless Jakarta residents stop discarding their waste in areas they're not supposed to.

In the last month, Hamidi said there were multiple reports of python sightings around Jakarta and West Java. A 2.5-metre snake was found in Cibinong, while another one was caught on a main road in Bogor. In April, a four-meter python emerged from a sewer in Pasar Minggu, a densely populated area of South Jakarta.

Suparno, a fireman at the South Jakarta Fire and Rescue Department, told CNN his team often captures snakes in houses or off the streets of Jakarta, although he cannot be sure of the exact figure, as the fire department keeps no official record. The most recent snake he captured was a python hiding in a bathroom.

Most common snakes found in Jakarta homes are not dangerous, however, Hamidi said that if large enough, a python can swallow a person and cobras are venomous.

One particularly horrific video showing a body being taken out of a snake went viral on the internet in March last year. The Jakarta Post said the 25-year-old man had gone missing after setting off to harvest palm oil in a remote village in Sulawesi, an island more than 2,000 kilometers to the northeast of Java, where Jakarta is located.

A cobra can spit venom that has the capacity to hurt smaller animals including household pets. For humans, cobras are usually only dangerous if the snake bites and the wound is left untreated for a long period of time without receiving anti-venom.

Rachmat explained snakes are generally afraid of people.

To prevent them from entering houses, Rachmat said the surrounding area must first be clean. He advises Jakartans to avoid piling up things that can be seen as a hiding spot for a snake.

"When their prey is gone, they will avoid the area. They only come to feed, if the food is gone they won't go to a place where there are many people," he said.

But in the case that someone finds a snake in their vicinity, Hamidi encourages people to stay calm.

"Don't panic. When you panic and move a lot, they may attack if they become scared," he said.
__label__politics (CNN) Rep. Mia Love's campaign has informed the Federal Election Commission that it will refund or redesignate less than half of what the government says was more than a million dollars improperly raised for a primary that was never expected to happen, according to documents reviewed by CNN.

The commission sent Love a letter in August saying the Utah Republican's campaign had violated federal guidelines about money for primaries. In Utah, candidates are not allowed to raise such funds if they have no primary, according to the FEC and experts specializing in election law. On Friday, Love's campaign responded to regulators, telling the FEC they would refund or redesignate some, but not all, of that money.

CNN's KFile reached out to Love, her campaign, her campaign treasurer and her campaign manager on Thursday about the contributions. They did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

In April, Love secured the nomination to seek a third term for her seat in Utah's 4th congressional district at Utah's nominating convention. In Utah, if a candidate receives such a nomination at a convention, like Love did, then no primary is held. At no point prior to April's convention did Love face a primary challenger or the threat of one.

But Love raised $1,153,624 and designated that money for a primary, according to the letter from the FEC to Love. Even after Love secured the nomination at the convention, she raised an additional $372,468 specifically designated for the primary that her campaign knew would not take place.

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) China's navy is getting bigger and better and doing it at a speed unmatched by any nation around the globe.

Earlier this month, the People's Liberation Army Navy launched two 13,000-ton Type 055 guided-missile destroyers -- Asia's largest, most sophisticated and most lethal combat ships.

"This ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers," said Rand Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath.

The double launching shows Beijing's unmatched military shipbuilding ability and its desire to project naval power far from Chinese shores, said Heath and other military analysts.

One of the two Type 055 guided-missile destroyers takes water at a shipyard in Dailan.

According to a report by China Daily, posted on the PLA's English-language website, the Type 055 will have double the firepower of China's Type 052D destroyers, which it said are currently "the largest and most powerful surface combatant commissioned in the PLA Navy."

China says each new destroyer will have 112 vertical launch tubes, from which it can fire long-range attack missiles, the equivalent of the US Navy's Tomahawk missile used as recently as Washington's strikes in Syria this year.

The missile launchers can also carry weaponry to target incoming aircraft, enemy ships and missiles. Anti-submarine warfare operations are the responsibility of two helicopters aboard each Type 055.

The new destroyers also boast a stealth design and high-end electronic battle management system to integrate Chinese aircraft carrier battle groups, the China Daily report said.

"This ship ... is designed for escorting Chinese aircraft carriers to more distant regions such as the Middle East," said Heath.

That would give China a so-called "blue water" navy, one that can operate far from homeland coasts, something that right now only the US Navy can do in overwhelming numbers across the world's oceans.

"The PLA Navy is progressively building a particularly well-defined 'blue water' fleet that will be in place at a certain date," said Peter Layton, a former Australian military officer and now fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute.

'The majesty of the Chinese state'

But through the Type 055's sheer size, it can send a message in waters closer to the Chinese mainland too.

"The Type 55As are big, very big," said Layton."The ships are a demonstration of the power, prestige and indeed majesty of the Chinese state and its ruling party," he added.

The Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam is the closest US match to China's new Type 055A destroyers.

China's new ships displace about 3,000 more tons than US or South Korea warships that have been the ones to look up to in Asian waters.

In the South China Sea, the Type 055As will have a considerable size advantage over the US Navy's 10,000-ton Ticonderoga-class cruisers and 9,000-ton US Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.

"The Type 55As handled aggressively they might be able to crowd US Navy ships out simply by their size," Layton said.

In the optics test outside China, big is almost always better, he added.

"It could be that China places more weight on naval diplomacy and thinks port visits from a very large warship will simply overawe the locals," Layton said.

Back in China, the July 3 double launch made big statements about what the US and its Asian allies, and indeed the world, can expect from Beijing in the future.

The two Type 055s join two others put into the water in June , 2017, and April this year. Those ships came off a production line in Shanghai. The most recent two came off lines in Dalian, in Liaoning province, according to the China Daily.

It "showcases the enormous capacity of Chinese shipbuilders," Heath said. "Most countries, including the United States, usually launch one ship at a time due to limited shipyard manufacturing capacity."

Maintaining two simultaneous production lines for one model of ship, especially in the same shipyard, is pricey, showing Beijing ranks delivery schedule as more important that cost, Heath said.

"China will pay whatever it takes to get them finished to a specified deadline," he added.

Matching the US Navy



Beijing will pay whatever it takes to stand toe-to-toe with the US Navy, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.

He said he expects China to build around 20 of the high-end Type 055s and augment them with smaller Type 054 frigates and aircraft carriers in service or under construction to field four carrier battle groups by 2030.

Other shipbuilding is under way for amphibious assault ships -- essentially baby aircraft carriers -- and helicopter platform docks that can move and deploy Marine ground battalions, said Schuster, now a Hawaii Pacific University professor.

And China has been leaking through state media that it's working on things like an electromagnetic pulse cannon, hypersonic aircraft and the most modern of launching systems for its aircraft carriers, he said.

"China is indeed sending the signal that it is both expanding the PLA Navy and equipping it with modern naval combatants equal to that of the US Navy," Schuster said.

The China Daily report said the two Type 55As launched on July 3 would soon begin sea trials, where crew and engineers will make sure everything works as planned.

Those trials have yet to be completed for the two previously launched Type 055s and no estimation was given on when they might actually be ready to be commissioned and join a carrier battle group.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The US has made repeated proposals to North Korea on denuclearization, all of which have been rejected, according to senior diplomatic sources.

The United States has made, and continues to make, "specific proposals for starting and proceeding to the end point of fully verified denuclearization," including a timeline, these sources say.

North Korea has rejected all of these proposals, considering them "gangster-like," one of the sources said.

The impasse has brought the rocket-like trajectory of Trump administration diplomacy with North Korea down to earth and the more typical grind of talks with Pyongyang that have stymied prior administrations.

The vague promises that emerged from President Donald Trump's June summit with leader Kim Jong Un have led to a diplomatic disconnect. The brief document produced after the leaders met included no time frame, no specific promises or milestones to meet, allowing both sides to interpret it as they wished.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Conservative activists Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk were accosted at a Philadelphia restaurant on Monday by protesters from a local antifa group.

Owens and Kirk, who lead the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA, had their breakfast at Green Eggs Café prematurely ended when protests erupted outside.

Owens told CNN that the protesters, who bore an antifa sticker, "immediately recognized" Kirk and her, and a much larger group approached the restaurant about 20 minutes later. She said the protesters began harassing and throwing things at Kirk and her from outside the restaurant.

Videos posted by Owens, who is black, and Kirk on Twitter depict an angry scene in which protesters recite chants such as "f--- white supremacy," "no good cops in a racist system" and "cops and Klan hand-in-hand."

__label__world (CNN) Every weekday morning, about 70 students stream into a house in a quiet neighborhood on Malaysia's Penang Island.

The children are Rohingya refugees and the house is a private school where they learn Malay, English, math and science.

This life is light years away from the one the children left behind in Myanmar.

"People were getting hit and killed and the police were arresting people. My whole village was burned down," 13-year-old Anwar Sadek Shah Ahmad says softly, cowering into his teacher's shoulder.

Anwar and his family fled their fishing village in Myanmar's Rakhine State in 2013 after violence broke out.

His grandmother, he said, only fled Myanmar last year and is now in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, where more than 680,000 Rohingya have fled to since August 2017.

he's among the Rohingya refugees who escaped from Rakhine State by boat largely before 2015, when There are thousands of children like Anwar in Malaysia —he's among the Rohingya refugees who escaped from Rakhine State by boat largely before 2015, when Kuala Lumpur began turning back Rohingya arrivals.

Even though they consider themselves the lucky ones, those who made it to Malaysia still lead lives fraught with risk and hardship.

"They have no legal rights — no right to work, no opportunity for mainstream education, and are obliged to eke out a very difficult living in the grey market economy of the country," said Richard Towle, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Representative for Malaysia.

This is the case for all refugees in Malaysia. Most of the 150,000 refugees there are from Myanmar, but there are also Pakistanis, Syrians, Yemenis and Palestinians.

Anwar's father has been working illegally in Penang since 2006 and paid smugglers to bring over his son, daughter and wife by boat. Anwar also has an infant brother who was born in Malaysia. The family are now registered with the UNHCR.

The UN body has registered 62,000 Rohingya refugees in Malaysia, but the organization estimates there could be another 30,000 to 40,000 who are there illegally and don't have official refugee status -- obtaining it is a lengthy process that can only happen in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.

"UNHCR Malaysia prioritises refugees in immigration detention, vulnerable refugees who have come to UNHCR from referral partners including government agencies, and others who have been interviewed and found to need UNHCR's protection and support," said Towle.

It's not clear whether Malaysia will accept any of those who have fled since August, an exodus that has lead to the world's fastest growing refugee crisis in Bangladesh.

The Muslim Rohingya have been denied citizenship in mostly Buddhist Myanmar since 1982, and while the group has long been discriminated against, the situation has deteriorated significantly in the past few years. Between 2012 and 2015, more than 112,000 Rohingya fled, largely by boat, to Malaysia.

In September 2017, Zulkifli Abu Bakar, the director-general of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said those fleeing violence in Myanmar would not be turned away, and that they would be provided temporary shelter.

But in 2015, Wan Junaidi Jaafar, the Malaysian Deputy Home Minister, said the Rohingya arriving in the country illegally would be turned back.

"We cannot welcome them here," Wan Junaidi said , adding that if the country continued to welcome them "hundreds of thousands" would come from Myanmar and Bangladesh.

CNN reached out to Zulkifli as well as the country's Ministry of Home Affairs for this article but did not get a response.

The latest exodus was sparked in last August, after an attack on government border posts by a Rohingya militant group resulted in a brutal crackdown by Myanmar's military. Refugees poured into Bangladesh with horrific stories of systematic rape, mass killings and arson -- although Myanmar's military denies killing any civilians or committing atrocities.

Challenges

In Malaysia, schools such as the one Anwar goes to, have sprouted up because while the country tolerates Rohingya presence and the UNHCR has issued them refugee status, they are still officially considered illegal migrants and therefore can't go to regular schools.

This limits their options to schools run by non-government organisations, or religious schools known as madrassas where they learn Arabic and study Islam.

According to the UNHCR, there are about 50 schools in Malaysia run by non-governmental organisations educating Rohingya children.

Anwar studies at the Penang Peace Learning Centre, also known as the School of Peace. On the morning CNN visited, Anwar and the older students were being taught math while the younger students, aged three to six, did coloring. Their classroom was also home to two pet rabbits.

All classes are held in Malay, or Bahasa Melayu, the country's national tongue. The kids have picked up the language despite arriving with no knowledge of Malay just a few years ago.

"Malay is easy, we hear it everywhere, but English is hard," says Rosmin Kayas, 12, who arrived in 2014.

The School of Peace was founded by Kamarulzaman Askandar, a political science lecturer at the Universiti Sains Malaysia, who learned about the Rohingya's plight while doing research.

He said: "I was sad about how bad their lives in Malaysia have been, that they can't work and that their children do not have access to free education."

The school started as weekend classes using space in the local religious school. As the student population grew, Kamarulzaman rented a terrace house and hired three teachers so the school could run five days a week.

But there are huge challenges. They struggle to find the RM6,000 (US$1,471) needed to run the school each month and neighbors complain about the school being in their neighborhood, because of the noise.

The school is mainly funded by individual donations. "Other organizations like the UNHCR also helps from time to time with school materials and training support for the teachers," he said.

Most frustratingly, he says, he has difficulty keeping the children in school.

"Older boys would be asked by the families to look for jobs, while older girls would be asked by the parents to help the families at home, and to be married off when they come of age," Kamarulzaman says.

Rosmin's sister, for example, is only 13, but was pulled out of school early this year to help out at home when their mother got pregnant.

Kamarulzaman says there is also little incentive for older kids to stay in school since the school only teaches the elementary school syllabus, which is typically for children aged seven to 12.

He said he wants to start teaching the secondary school syllabus — if he can secure funding that will provide the teachers and the necessary space.

Students sit in class at the Penang Peace Learning Center.

What next?

Experts say Malaysia should look at improving the Rohingya's access to employment, healthcare and education.

"It is really about livelihood — being able to work and to feed their families and to have enough money to use services from the market. If they cannot access government services, they need money for healthcare services and to send their children to school," Oh Su-Ann, a visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute.

Towle from the UNCHR says he can understand why Malaysia is afraid committing towards formal arrangements for the refugees might cause more to arrive.

"We believe that a carefully managed registration scheme, where UNHCR and the Government, working closely together, can mitigate the risks of this but could also deliver the positive dividends to Malaysia and to refugees," he said.

But despite the difficulties with work and education, the Rohingya students and parents at the Penang school say they are happy.

Malaysia is peaceful compared to what he left behind, says Anwar. Now, he spends his free time playing football with new friends from the neighborhood.

Likewise, Jubairah Bashir, 34, who brought three children to her illegal migrant husband in Penang in 2013, says she has picked up basic Bahasa Melayu and can buy her groceries. She has also made Malaysian friends.

"If I can, I want to go home to Myanmar. But otherwise Malaysia is good and the children have school here," she says.

"At least the family is together now."

__label__politics (CNN) Ivanka Trump has decided to shut down her company after deciding to pursue a career in public policy instead of returning to her fashion company.

Trump's clothing and accessory business has been operating with limitations to reduce potential violations of ethics laws and the perceptions she's profiteering off her White House role. Given those restrictions, Ivanka, who serves as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, decided it didn't make sense to keep the company running if she's not returning after her father's presidency, two people with knowledge of her decision-making process told CNN.

"When we first started this brand, no one could have predicted the success that we would achieve. After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington, so making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners," Ivanka Trump said in a statement.

"I am beyond grateful for the work of our incredible team who has inspired so many women; each other and myself included. While we will not continue our mission together, I know that each of them will thrive in their next chapter."

Ivanka is expected to address her company's staff on Tuesday in New York, according to a source with knowledge of her decision-making process. The same source said 18 people will be affected by the company shutting down.

__label__politics (CNN) First lady Melania Trump spoke out against cyberbullying Monday as part of her Be Best campaign, warning against "destructive and harmful" uses of social media and once again highlighting a messaging rift between the East Wing and the West Wing.

"In today's global society, social media is an inevitable part of our children's daily lives," Trump said at a cyberbullying summit in Rockville, Maryland. "It can be used in many positive ways, but can also be destructive and harmful when used incorrectly. This is why Be Best chooses to focus on the importance of teaching our next generation how to conduct themselves safely and in a positive manner in an online setting."

At the same time, President Donald Trump was on Twitter, railing against John Brennan, whom he called a " hack " and " the worst CIA Director in our country's history" as summit panelists discussed the need for adults to be "good digital role models" for children. Despite firing off multiple tweets Monday morning, none were about the first lady's Be Best initiatives or her speech.

The President's well-known Twitter habit, exemplified last week by his harsh attack on former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, has drawn criticism and highlights the seeming disconnect between the East Wing and the West Wing.

"When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!" he tweeted

The first lady's spokeswoman sought to downplay any disconnect between the East Wing and the West Wing, calling the first lady "independent."

"She's addressed this before. She is well aware of the criticism, but that will not deter her from doing what she feels is right. I would hope most people in this country are proud that they have a strong and independent first lady who only has the best interests of children at heart -- I know I am," the first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham told CNN.

In a White House with a President who makes his own rules -- especially on social media -- his wife has faced criticism for being unable to curb her own husband's behavior. Instead, she's made an independent choice to do what she can.

"She is aware of the criticism but it will not deter her from doing what she feels is right. The President is proud of her commitment to children and encourages her in all that she does," Grisham said in a statement.

Responding to the apparent hypocrisy between the first lady's assertion that social media can be "destructive and harmful when used incorrectly" and the President's own habits, Grisham deflected.

"Rather than dissecting her remarks, let's focus on the countless children who struggle w bullying & online safety each day," she tweeted

She later described Trump's advocacy against cyberbullying as "a sincere campaign meant to help children."

During her speech, the first lady acknowledged that children can be more aware of the "pitfalls" of social media than adults.

"Let's face it: most children are more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of social media than some adults, but we still need to do all we can to provide them with information and tools for successful and safe online habits," she said.

Be Best

Trump's Be Best campaign, which she launched in May, centers on three key issues for children: well-being, fighting opioid abuse and positivity on social media.

Speaking about her husband's social media habits in an interview on CBS' "60 Minutes" just after the 2016 election, Melania Trump said that sometimes it got him in trouble, "but it helped a lot, as well."

Asked whether she spoke up if she felt he crossed a line, the first lady said, "Yes, I tell him all the time."

But she conceded that at the end of the day, he does what he wants.

"I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do at the end. He's an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it," Trump said.
__label__world (CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has "unwavering trust for President Trump" and wants to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula before the US leader finishes his term, South Korean officials said Thursday.

"This trust, despite some difficulties surfaced during the negotiation process between the US and the North, will continue," said South Korean special envoy Chung Eun-yong, who met with Kim in Pyongyang on Wednesday.

Chung said Kim told him North Korea "was willing to take more active measures toward denuclearization if his advance steps could be met with matching measures (from the US)."

Kim said he had "never said anything bad about President Trump to anyone," Chung reported, adding that the North Korean leader expressed a wish to end 70 years of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula.

Chung had just returned from a trip north to finalize plans for a meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-In, to be held in Pyongyang from September 18 to 20. It will be the first trip by a sitting South Korean president to the North Korean capital since 2007, and the third meeting between the two men this year.

__label__world (CNN) Japan's space agency will attempt to land a robotic unmanned landing craft on the surface of an asteroid 300 million-kilometers (186.4 million-miles) away from Earth next month.

The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft is currently orbiting around the diamond-shaped asteroid Ryugu, which it reached in June after a three-and-a-half year journey

On September 21, the spacecraft will deploy the first of two landers onto the asteroid itself, where they will gather samples and conduct experiments. A second lander will be launched on October 3.

Later in the mission, the spacecraft itself will land on the asteroid after blowing a small crater in it using explosives, so samples can be gathered from below the object's surface which have not been exposed to space.

Japanese scientists are currently racing NASA for that historic achievement, with the US agency's own sample retrieval mission due to arrive back on Earth in 2023. Hayabusa-2 is due to return in 2020.

Treasure-trove

Beneath their desolate surface, asteroids are believed to contain a rich treasure-trove of information about the formation of the solar system billions of years ago.

"By exploring a C-type asteroid, which is rich in water and organic materials, we will clarify interactions between the building blocks of Earth and the evolution of its oceans and life, thereby developing solar system science," JAXA said.

C-type asteroids, which are largely composed of carbon, are the most common variety of asteroids, comprising more than 75% of those currently discovered. The other two main types of asteroid are the metallic S and M-types, according to NASA

Despite years of planning, Ryugu's diamond shape took the team by surprise as the mission neared the asteroid.

"From a distance, Ryugu initially appeared round, then gradually turned into a square before becoming a beautiful shape similar to fluorite -- known as the 'firefly stone' in Japanese," the space agency said in a statement.

"This form of Ryugu is scientifically surprising, and also poses a few engineering challenges," it said of difficulties, including landing, on the unusually shaped asteroid.

That said, the team has already achieved a mighty feat by reaching the 900-meter-wide rock at all -- something it described as the equivalent of hitting a 6-centimeter (2.4-inch) target at 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away.

"In other words, arriving at Ryugu is the same as aiming at a 6-centimeter target in Brazil from Japan," the agency said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Transportation Security Administration is considering eliminating passenger screening at more than 150 small and medium-sized airports across the US, according to senior agency officials and internal documents obtained by CNN.

The proposal, if implemented, would mark a major change for air travel in the US, following nearly two decades of TSA presence since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and comes as the Trump administration has stepped up screening measures for items such as laptops and tablets.

Internal documents from a TSA working group say the proposal to cut screening at small and some medium-sized airports serving aircraft with 60 seats or fewer could bring a "small (non-zero) undesirable increase in risk related to additional adversary opportunity."

The internal documents from June and July suggest the move could save $115 million annually, money that could be used to bolster security at larger airports.

According to the proposal, passengers and luggage arriving from these smaller airports would be screened when they arrive at major airports for connecting flights instead of the current practice of joining the already screened population at the larger airport. The high-volume airports have greater capacities and more advanced security measures than smaller locations, the documents say.

CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said it was "stunning that this is even seriously being considered."

"Al Qaeda and ISIS still regard aviation as a priority target -- that includes aircraft where you have fewer than 60 people on board," he said. "They would see that as a way to hit the headlines. They would see that as a way to inflict severe economic damage on the United States. If you have an aircraft of 50 or so people being blown out of the sky there is going to be a great amount of panic and there will indeed be significant economic reverberations, and of course significant loss of life."

"This is so dangerous," a TSA field leader at a large airport said. The individual is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Two senior TSA officials, who asked not to be identified, expressed serious national security concerns over the proposal. They said the idea was explored as far back as 2011 and has been resurrected. The documents referred to some 150 small airports in addition to some midsize ones. TSA currently screens passengers at 440 airports, according to its website.

The working group determined that the policy change would affect about 10,000 passengers who are screened by 1,299 TSA employees daily, which amounts to about 0.5% of the people who fly out of US airports on any given day. The report not list specific airports that could be affected by the policy change.

TSA spokesman Michael Bilello said the study reflects a recurring debate within the agency about its legal requirements.

"This is not a new issue," he said via email. "The regulations which established TSA does not require screening below a certain level, so every year is 'the year' that TSA will reconsider screening." Bilello did not respond to a request for the text of the regulations.

The two TSA senior officials said the level of activity around the proposal this year -- the formation of a working group to conduct a risk and cost analysis -- mean this is more than an annual exercise.

The documents said a TSA working group of 20 people, including a representative of the agency's administrator's office, met on June 21 to examine the potential risks of the policy change. An internal TSA memo dated July 17 from TSA Director of Enterprise Performance and Risk Strategy Jerry Booker to the TSA administrator's chief of staff, Ha Nguyen McNeill, outlines the group's findings. It contains no formal recommendation.

Small airport security issues

The concept of rolling back security at regional airports recalls the coordinated attacks that brought the TSA into existence.

Two of the September 11 attackers first flew from an airport in Portland, Maine, to Boston before boarding American Airlines flight 11, forcing entry to the cockpit and steering it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. While Portland's airport likely would not be included in the proposal because of its volume of passengers, the 9/11 attackers perceived the airport to be less secure because of its relatively small size.

The proposal asserts that small aircraft would not be "attractive" to terrorists. The documents conclude that attacks with small aircraft would not as attractive a "payoff" because "the potential for loss of life" would be lower than terrorists could achieve with larger planes.

Juliette Kayyem, who was an assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said small planes could still be weaponized to cause major loss of life.

"People, weapons, dangerous goods and what's boarding the plane are all potential risks," said Kayyem, a CNN analyst. "TSA is falling into the trap that this is just about terror. A gun could be brought on board too."

Shift from earlier administration rhetoric, policy

The proposal under consideration by TSA is different from the agency's current approach to screening passengers.

Since TSA's inception in 2001, the trend has mostly been toward more enhanced security measures, including limiting gels and liquids in carry-on bags, requiring more advanced screening and directing passengers to remove shoes and belts for screening.

In June 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly announced a laptop ban from carry-ons affecting nearly 280 airports in more than 100 countries.

"Terrorists want to bring down aircraft to instill fear, disrupt our economies and undermine our way of life," Kelly said . "And it works, which is why they still see aviation as the crown jewel target."

He continued, "The threat has not diminished. In fact, I am concerned that we are seeing renewed interest on the part of terrorist groups to go after the aviation sector -- from bombing aircraft to attacking airports on the ground."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) When Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor testified in 2009, confirmation seemed so certain that Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham famously predicted she only had to avoid a "complete meltdown."

As Judge Brett Kavanaugh takes the witness chair on Tuesday, the sense of inevitability in these partisan times is even greater. Republicans control the Senate, they are tightly managing the vetting process, and Democrats no longer have an opportunity for a filibuster to block a final vote

Yet the inevitability is strikingly paradoxical because the stakes for the nine-member Supreme Court are greater than they have been in decades. America's highest court rests on a precipice, with many rights -- those related to abortion and university affirmative action, to name just two -- teetering on a single vote.

The chance also exists that this deeply divided bench could end up resolving a dispute related to investigations involving President Donald Trump. Most significant, of course, is special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential campaign and any ties to Trump's campaign.

Kavanaugh, 53, would succeed Anthony Kennedy, who steadied the bench. A centrist conservative with a 30-year tenure, Kennedy fluctuated in his approach. So, the four liberals had a shot at persuading him to move left on social issues.

__label__world (CNN) Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said Friday he will resign following weeks of controversy after he announced he was expecting a baby with a former staff member.

Earlier in February, Joyce had admitted to the affair, confirming long-running rumors, but refused to resign saying it was a private matter.

Then on Thursday, the National Party said it had received a separate, formal complaint against its leader , accusing him of sexual harassment, Australia's national broadcaster ABC reported.

CNN contacted the National Party but didn't receive an immediate response. The Nationals govern in a coalition agreement with the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Speaking to journalists, he said he was resigning from his role as leader of the National Party, to put aside "this current cacophony of issues" and avoid further harassment of his family and partner.

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) The Pentagon kicked off the world's largest naval war games last week, the biennial, month-long Rim of the Pacific exercises, known as RIMPAC, bringing together 46 ships and submarines, 200 aircraft and 25,000 troops from 25 nations.

Missing from that contingent is China, which was disinvited from RIMPAC over its militarization of islands in the South China Sea.

But as ships were arriving in Hawaii for RIMPAC, China was completing naval exercises of its own, with a series of live-fire naval drills off Taiwan that began on June 17.

That the two sets of exercises overlap only serves to reinforce the differences between the two super powers, as both countries vie for military influence in the Pacific.

RIMPAC is about "building relationships," US military leaders said at a press conference in Hawaii on Thursday, pointing out Indo-Pacific nations making first-time or upgraded contributions to the exercises, including Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, which all have claims in the South China Sea.

"We work together, build relationships here, so later on ... it's hard to turn down a friend," Vice Adm. John Alexander, commander of the US Navy's 3rd Fleet, told the Pearl Harbor gathering marking the beginning of the games.

And RIMPAC shows the US Navy is better at making friends than its Chinese counterpart, analysts say.

"China's absence means that it loses an opportunity to ... establish professional and potentially personal relationships with its regional and global naval counterparts," said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.

Beijing does not host any naval exercises on the scope of RIMPAC, Schuster said.

"There is a bit of the 'I'm the popular kid on the block' approach to all this," said Peter Layton, visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, pointing out that the US Navy knows how to show off its and its partners' capabilities.

Among the planned RIMPAC missions are new missile demonstrations, amphibious exercises, mine clearing and anti-piracy exercises, according to the US Navy.

Expect all to be well publicized with tweets, photos and videos and postings on the RIMPAC Facebook page

"It highlights in graphic media detail lasting a month that navies want to exercise with the US Navy," Layton said.

And the presence of the South China Sea nations at RIMPAC shows loyalties in the region remain very much in play, said Layton.

Making friends and extending influence

Washington has periodically sent warships within boundaries declared by China around disputed islands, but those so-called "freedom of navigation operations" have not been joined by other Southeast Asian navies.

RIMPAC gives those Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) a chance to show "passive support" for the US position, Layton said.

Republic of Singapore Navy guided-missile frigate RSS Tenacious arrives at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in preparation for RIMPAC 2018. Singapore is one of seven ASEAN nations participating in the exercises.

The 10 ASEAN nations include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. All but Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar are at RIMPAC.

"ASEAN states might not be willing to sail with the US Navy through the disputed waters but they are keen to exercise with the US Navy and show solidarity that way," Layton said.

"Vietnam for the first time attending this year's exercise is significant in that regard. The Philippines involvement similarly indicates they wish to hedge their bets and remind China they have other options," he said.

Broad coalition

Outside of Southeast Asia, the US is giving important roles to other allies.

Canadian and Japanese admirals will be in the Nos. 2 and 3 overall command positions and Australian and Chilean commanders will the maritime and air components respectively.

Members of the Canadian 2nd Battalion Royal 22e Régiment wait to take off during loading and offloading drills for the MV-22 Osprey during Rim of the Pacific exercises on Thursday.

"The trust built in RIMPAC will pay dividends when we all respond together to crises that may arise," Adm. John Aquilino, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, said at Pearl Harbor on Thursday.

China, meanwhile, sent a flotilla of warships for a week of "real combat training" around Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory but has been a self-governed, democratic island since 1949 following a civil war on the Chinese mainland.

Beijing said the combat exercises were "directed at separatist elements advocating "Taiwan independence," according to a report from the state-run Xinhua news service.

The Chinese military said two warships from its Eastern Theater Command spearheaded the exercises -- with added units from air and coastal defense forces -- in the Taitung Strait, the Bashi Strait and the Taiwan Strait, according to Xinhua.

Highlighting that the exercises were conducted by the Eastern Theater Command, formed during a Chinese military reorganization in 2016, was important, according to Schuster, the former US Navy officer now a Hawaii Pacific University professor.

"It means the PLA Navy and the joint command structure are getting better, more capable and they want Taiwan and the United States to know it," he said.

UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters take part in Taiwan drills simulating Chinese attacks in June 2018.

The exercises came while US Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had pulled China's RIMPAC invitation in early June, visited leaders in Beijing.

They included President Xi Jinping, who made his position on the South China Sea clear.

"Our stance is steadfast and clear-cut when it comes to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Xi said, according to state media, adding that " any inch of territory passed down from ancestors cannot be lost while we want nothing from others."

Alternative alliances

Beijing isn't showing any envy of RIMPAC either. On Thursday, the Defense Ministry announced its planning naval drills with the 10 ASEAN nations later this year, aiming to "enhance mutual trust, expand exchange and cooperation, and safeguard regional peace and stability," Xinhua reported.

Meanwhile, Layton says for all the US military's talk of building relationships, there's one person who could burn them down during the month of RIMPAC -- Donald Trump.

The US President has meetings with NATO and European Union leaders as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin scheduled for July.

"Donald Trump is widely expected to insult the Europeans and the Canadians, and actively try to damage NATO and the EU, while heaping praise on Putin for Syria and the Ukraine," the Australian analyst said.

"Some EU nations and maybe others may wonder why they are supporting a US exercise in the Pacific," Layton said. "Trump in attacking allies and friends will undo for all participants some of RIMPAC's soft power aspects."
__label__world (CNN) A 34-year-old Georgia man faces up to 20 years in prison after being found guilty in the beating of an African-American man during racially charged protests last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Alex Michael Ramos was among a group of attackers captured on widely shared cell phone video in the August 12 beating of DeAndre Harris in a parking garage during the Unite the Right rally.

A Charlottesville Circuit Court jury on Thursday convicted Ramos of malicious wounding, according to court clerk Llezelle Agustin Dugger.

The jury recommended a six-year prison term when Ramos is sentenced on August 23, Dugger said.

Defense attorney Jake Joyce asked the jury to find his client guilty of the lesser charge of assault and battery, CNN affiliate WVIR reported . Ramos took a "cheap shot" at Harris' head, Joyce said in opening statements, according to the station. He did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

The verdict comes one day after a separate jury convicted Jacob Scott Goodwin, 23, of the same charge in connection with the beating.

The maximum sentence for malicious wounding is 20 years in prison.

Two other men, Daniel Borden, 18, and Tyler Watkins Davis, 49, have trial dates set for the summer.

Vonzz Long, a friend of Harris', told CNN the two were part of a group of people staging counterprotests that day against neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He said they got into an argument with people from hate groups who threw things and shouted racial slurs at them, and he and Harris got separated during the ensuing chaos.

When Long eventually found him, Harris was surrounded by neo-Nazis in the garage and being beaten bloody, he said.

The Supreme Court said the activists should be kept under house arrest until its next hearing on the matter, scheduled for September 6.

Prashant Bhushan, a prominent civil-rights lawyer who represented the activists, said they had been "working on human rights causes for the past 20 to 25 years."

"Dissent is the safety word of democracy. If you do not allow dissent, the pressure cooker will burst," lawyer Vrinda Grover told reporters outside the Supreme Court in New Delhi, quoting comments made by the judge hearing the case.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) When Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who supports abortion rights, emerged from her office last month after her first meeting with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, reporters listened closely trying to divine whether she would back President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee.

Her vote, in a closely divided Senate, could help to determine not only Kavanaugh's fate, but the future of Roe v. Wade, the historic 1973 opinion that legalized abortion. Although the opinion was decided more than 40 years ago, it remains a lightning rod in modern confirmation hearings as senators on each side of the issue have tried to press nominees to tip their hands.

Abortion opponents hope that Kavanaugh will provide a fifth vote on a court decision to either overturn Roe or weaken the decision. The stakes are high. Kavanaugh has never opined directly on the case, but if confirmed, he will fill the seat of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was a key swing vote on the issue of abortion restrictions.

To reporters, Collins suggested that she thought Kavanaugh respected Roe because he told her that it was "settled law."

"He said that he agreed with what (Chief) Justice (John) Roberts said at his nomination hearing in which he said it was settled law," Collins said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is facing mounting pressure over her future, with calls from members of her own party to step aside as discussions about potential successors gain more traction -- both in the national spotlight and among members of Congress.

Pelosi has repeatedly said she's not going anywhere, and she's challenging anyone who wants to run for speaker -- should Democrats retake the House in November -- to prove they have what it takes to lead the party.

The future of Democratic leadership in the House is a topic many in the party's leadership are desperate to keep out of the headlines ahead of the midterms, hoping to keep the spotlight on an energized base rather than intraparty debates.

While Democrats feel optimistic about their chances at retaking the House , who will lead the party is another question all together. With so many variables at stake --mostly whether Pelosi can get the 218 votes needed to become speaker -- and no clear next-in-line candidate, some members are positioning themselves, preparing for a possible vacancy at the top of the party. Those conversations are largely taking place behind the scenes at this point -- though some of have spilled over into public view this week -- but all under the context as possible backup scenarios if Pelosi doesn't run.

"Where two or more members are gathered in Washington, invariably the discussion about House leadership comes up," Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins of New York, who has already stated he won't support Pelosi this fall, told CNN in a phone interview Thursday.

One of Pelosi's closest allies, however, is publicly expressing interest in the speaker's gavel. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, says he'll support Pelosi if she decides to stay -- but he's also ready to step in if she doesn't.

For her part, Pelosi is counting on her experience as well as her colossal fundraising power to shore up her path to return to the speakership.

Pelosi was also lauded by her party for helping to usher through the Affordable Care Act when Democrats controlled the House during the first two years under President Barack Obama. Since Republicans have taken back the majority, she has largely kept her caucus together in opposing big Republican initiatives and has had no major defections on key votes. Even those who want to see new leadership still routinely praise her 15-year tenure as leader of the caucus.

As Pelosi put it to MSNBC last weekend, "I think I'm the best person for the job."

Clyburn shows interest if Pelosi leaves

Clyburn, if elected speaker, would be the first black Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives.

"If the opportunity is there I would absolutely do it," Clyburn told The New York Times , citing a verse from scripture on the importance of "keeping your lamps trimmed and burning to be ready when the bridegroom comes."

Clyburn also told Politico earlier this month, "If the opportunity is there, absolutely. I have been preparing myself for this role since my pre-teenage years."

A host of other names are frequently mentioned by lawmakers and aides as potential Pelosi-alternatives, including other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, such as the chairman, Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois and Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico are two other names, among many more, who get dropped as potential candidates seeking higher leadership positions.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, the current No. 2 Democrat in the House, is also considered a likely contender for the top spot should Pelosi step aside. He and Clyburn vied for the whip position in 2010, but after it was clear Clyburn would not get enough support, he was offered the newly-created position of Assistant Democratic Leader, averting a divisive caucus vote between Clyburn and Hoyer.

Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi in the last leadership race in 2016, has said he's considering launching another challenge if Pelosi stays.

But there's no consensus around any successor, as most are keeping their powder dry until the month after the midterms when it's clear what Pelosi will do and when other leadership campaigns launch into full swing. The caucus elections, which take place on a secret ballot, are slated for the week of December 5.

"I look forward to seeing the results of the election and assessing who opts to run for leadership after the outcome," said Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, who voted against Pelosi in 2016.

Headwinds for Pelosi from Democrats

Pelosi has faced dissension in the Democratic Party this cycle, as a growing number of candidates and some incumbents have expressed ambivalence towards her potential bid for speaker, including rising Democratic star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , who told CNN it was "far too early" to back a candidate for speaker following her surprise primary win in June, and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who called for "a new generation of leadership," in a July interview with CNN.

Supporters of Pelosi say she's getting unfair treatment that's largely based on her age rather than her abilities and leadership of the party. While at least 37 new Democratic candidates and incumbents, according to a CNN count, have said they won't support Pelosi, many others are showing deference to whatever decision she ultimately makes.

Before the Times published its interview with Clyburn this week, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland was asked Sunday on ABC's "This Week" if he felt it was time for an African American speaker. He said he thought it was "quite possible."

"But I'd bet everything I've got that Nancy Pelosi will be Speaker, period," he added.

In an interview with McClatchy, the 78-year-old Clyburn pledged a Clyburn speakership would be "transitional," not "custodial," and that he'd seek to make the Democratic Party more attractive "to young African Americans who still feel ... take(n) for granted."

"I think our party needs to be transformed and that's what I'm talking about," Clyburn said.

But Pelosi seemed unruffled at the prospect of others showing interest in the speakership, telling the Times, "What I have always tried to do is build a bridge to the future, and hope that would be in the majority. If people want to be the bridge that I'm building toward, they have to show what's on the other side of the bridge."

Pelosi's positive numbers

Pelosi's confidence is well-founded — internal documents obtained by CNN from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee show that the House minority leader raised an impressive $83 million through June for the 2018 election cycle, more than doubling the party's next highest fundraiser, DCCC chair Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who raised $35 million. Clyburn, for his part, has raised $3.7 million for the party's House campaign arm.

In The New York Times interview, Pelosi challenged anyone who wants to run for speaker to prove they have the fundraising prowess it takes to lead the party, as well as demonstrate they have "a following" and "a vision for the country."

Despite aggressive messaging by Republicans to paint Pelosi as a villain, the idea of another Pelosi speakership doesn't seem to sway voters one way or the other — in a CNN poll out this week , just 34% of registered voters said Pelosi will be an extremely or very important factor in their vote in 2018, putting her at the bottom of their voting considerations.

While leadership race chatter will undoubtedly ramp up again when members return next month from recess, Democrats -- both Pelosi detractors and supporters -- are still largely trying to stay on message for now.

Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who voted against Pelosi during the leadership race in 2016, reiterated over the weekend on MSNBC the common refrain that Democrats should solely focus on winning back the majority.

"Because until then, this is all a moot point," he said.
__label__world (CNN) It was a message in a bottle from the land of irrelevance. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-appointed caliph of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), this week purportedly put out a voice recording to his dwindling flock of followers, exhorting them to carry on a fight they've already lost.

At the height of ISIS' power in 2014, the group controlled a quasi-state roughly the size of Britain, including Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and Raqqa, its de facto capital, in Syria. Since then it has lost more than 90% of that territory and today holds sway over pockets of remote terrain straddling the two countries. In the audio message, titled "Give Glad Tidings to the Patient," Baghdadi downplayed the loss of territory and issued the usual calls for the overthrow of hostile Arab regimes. But as much as he might dismiss ISIS' losses, it's hard to imagine it ever recovering.

The US Defense Department and the United Nations estimate that there are still as many as 30,000 ISIS fighters still on the loose in Syria and Iraq, and although the Iraqi government has declared victory over the group, loyalists continue to conduct hit-and-run attacks and probably will do so for the foreseeable future.

Baghdadi was last seen in public in 2014.

Others who fight under its black banner are still present in parts of Africa, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and elsewhere. So-called "lone wolves" will continue to carry out attacks wherever and whenever they can in the land of the "Crusaders," as Baghdadi urged them in his message.

The message did go some way to put to rest the persistent rumors that Baghdadi was either critically injured or dead. The United States, which places so much importance on the killing of figureheads (think Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden), would clearly like to savor another "we got him" moment. Not yet. Reacting to Baghdadi's message, Capt. William Urban of the US Central Command told CNN: "We do not know where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is at this time, but he continues to be someone that we are interested in removing from the battlefield."

__label__politics (CNN) Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, facing additional reporting about his many controversies, is "inching forward to the tipping point," a senior administration official said.

The official, describing the feeling within the administration towards Pruitt, wondered whether the EPA administrator would still hold his job as he could crop up in Democratic candidates' ads hitting President Donald Trump's "swamp."

Ultimately, the decision is with Trump.

White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters on Tuesday that Trump is looking into the "numerous reports" about Pruitt.

"The President feels as though Scott Pruitt has done a really good job with deregulating the government, to allow for a thriving economy, that's important to him, but these things matter to the President as well, and he's looking into those," Gidley said. "When we have an announcement, we'll make it."
__label__politics (CNN) The prosecution in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort rested Monday after filling up 10 days with 27 witnesses.

Here are five takeaways:

Final testimony

Prosecutors tied up the loose ends of their case on Monday, calling the last banker to testify and asking a financial fraud federal agent to return to the witness box. The banker, James Brennan of Federal Savings Bank, put the finishing touches on how his bank's founder and chairman, Stephen Calk, assisted in Manafort's fraud by pushing $16 million in loans the bank knew were too risky to give.

The bank knew and documented the financial red flags that came with Manafort's loan applications -- from hidden debt to shaky professional income. Brennan even rated one loan for Manafort risky but doable in a memorandum used by regulators and the bank. He said on the stand Monday he would never have given that rating if Calk hadn't pressured him. Calk sought a top role in the Trump campaign and administration at the time the bank approved the loans, another witness testified.

"If I had my recommendation ... the loan would not be made," Brennan said. He gave it the sham rating "because the loan was going through," he added.

Prosecution rests

If that didn't give enough clarity to prosecutors' allegations, one last five-question exchange might have. Prosecutors won Judge T.S. Ellis' permission to call back a financial fraud agent with the enforcement agency FinCEN to speak about Manafort's foreign banking charges. The witness, Paula Liss, testified that not only hadn't Manafort himself disclosed to the agency the existence of his foreign accounts, but neither did his consulting company, which brought in millions of dollars for Ukrainian lobbying. She spoke directly to the question of whether Manafort knew he needed to disclose to the federal government his foreign bank accounts.

With little fanfare following Liss' final answers, prosecutor Greg Andres stood up to say the prosecution was done.

Calk's list of 'rolls'

One of Calk's dream jobs was running the Pentagon.

The Justice Department released emails from Calk to Manafort where the banker made his case for a Trump administration job -- including secretary of defense.

The list of "Perspective Rolls (sic)," as Calk wrote, also included the top jobs at Treasury, Commerce and Housing and Urban Development.

Calk also listed 19 potential ambassadorships. He declared himself for the United Kingdom job as "most qualified as I grew up in London."

Also on the list: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Ireland, Australia, China, United Nations, NATO, European Union, Portugal, Holy See, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands and Singapore.

Manafort defense hopes some charges may be dismissed

Manafort's defense attorneys formally asked the court to dismiss the case, a type of request that typically happens at the end of a prosecution's presentation and is usually quickly set aside by the trial judge.

But the defense team thinks it has an extra leg up on dismissing the four Federal Savings Bank fraud charges because Ellis previously suggested in court that the bank couldn't be defrauded if Calk wanted Manafort to have the loans.

"We believe there's not been a showing of materiality as to those counts, that the bank -- the evidence suggests that the bank did not rely on any representations made by Mr. Manafort in granting those loans, and at this time, it would be appropriate to dismiss those counts," defense attorney Richard Westling said in court Monday evening.

Ellis appears set to rule on these final requests Tuesday when court reconvenes at 9:30 a.m. ET.

Will Manafort testify? What's next

Now, the big question is what Manafort's defense team will do. Will it present a case and call witnesses? Will Manafort testify in his own defense? Or will his defense team do nothing, effectively rolling the dice on its efforts to cut down the prosecution witnesses' testimony over the past two weeks?

It would be surprising if Manafort testified. He'd open himself up to cross-examination by the prosecutors, who've presented reams of evidence against him, and anything he says in court could be used against him in September, when his second criminal trial for foreign lobbying violations is set to begin.

Both the prosecutors and the defense team say they want two hours each to make their closing arguments.

"I think that's within the outer envelopes of reasonable. So I'll permit two hours, but I tell you, it's no accident that TV programs are half an hour," Ellis told them on Friday, continuing his active presence in the courtroom.

Then, once both sides have rested, the court will determine the instructions they give to a jury. And the jury will start its work.
__label__world (CNN) Authorities in the UK have opened a murder investigation after a British woman died from exposure to a Soviet-era nerve agent that had previously sickened a former Russian spy and his daughter.

Prime Minister Theresa May said that authorities were "working urgently to establish the facts of this incident," adding that she was "shocked and appalled" by the death of 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess on Sunday evening.

Speaking at Scotland Yard on Monday, Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner for counterterrorism with London's Metropolitan Police, said there was no evidence that the nerve agent that caused Sturgess' death was linked to the attack on the Sergei and Yulia Skripal, but that this remained the "main line of enquiry."

UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid last week called on Russia to provide an explanation for the incident after it was confirmed that Sturgess and another person, 45-year-old Charles Rowley, were exposed to Novichok , the same substance that sickened the Skripals in March.

Sturgess and Rowley fell ill in the town of Amesbury in Wiltshire, about eight miles north of Salisbury, where the Skripals were poisoned. Yulia Skripal was discharged from the hospital in April and her father was released a few weeks later

Russia denies any involvement in the Skripals' case. Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia blasted the UK during a UN Security Council meeting in April , calling the allegations a "fake story."

Over 20 countries, including the US, expelled Russian diplomats in a show of support for the UK.

Despite dismissing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin at a rally in Montana last week, US President Donald Trump said in March that he believed the UK government's theory that Russia was probably responsible for the attack on the Skripals.

"It sounds to me like it would be Russia, based on all the evidence they have," Trump told reporters on March 13. The White House later said it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats as retaliation for Moscow's alleged actions.

Prime Minister May is hosting Trump later this week, just days before the US President is scheduled to meet Putin in Finland.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed any Russian involvement in the Amesbury poisoning, calling it "more of a UK problem."

Asked by CNN to comment on remarks by a Russian official who suggested that the poisoning had been "done on purpose" to derail the World Cup and ongoing summit preparations," Peskov said it was "absurd" to mention Russia in connection with the incident, but added, "the nature of the incident raises concerns and poses a big threat."

Contaminated item not yet located

Police believe Sturgess and Crowley were exposed to the nerve agent Novichok after handling a contaminated item. Both were admitted to Salisbury District Hospital nine days ago after falling ill, the same hospital where the Skripals were treated.

"Our focus and priority at this time is to identify and locate any container that we believe may be the source of the contamination," said assistant commissioner Basu Monday.

"Their reaction was so severe, it resulted in Dawn's death and Charlie being critically ill. This means that they must have got a high dose and our hypothesis is that they must have handled a container we are now seeking."

There is no evidence that either Sturgess or Rowley visited any of the sites that were decontaminated following the attack in March, according to authorities, who say they are continuing to build a time line of the couple's movements.

Police initially cordoned off six sites in Amesbury and Salisbury and later expanded their probe of one of those sites -- low-income housing in the center of Salisbury -- to include part of the nearby street and inside the building.

Dawn Sturgess is understood to have links to John Baker House, which CNN saw residents leaving under instruction from police. The social housing is located about half a mile from a restaurant where the Skripals dined before falling ill.

Very difficult to treat

Sturgess initially collapsed at an address in Amesbury on June 30 and was taken to the hospital, police said. Five hours after her collapse, police said, an ambulance was called back to the same address for Rowley, who also fell ill and was taken to hospital.

Salisbury District Hospital's medical director, Dr. Christine Blanshard, said Sunday that the staff "worked tirelessly to save Dawn."

"Dawn's death illustrates just how difficult it is for the doctors treating her," said Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds. "Even though they are now the most experienced team in the world for dealing with this nerve agent, there are still limits to how much they are able to do."

"This latest horrendous turn of events has only served to strengthen the resolve of our investigation team as we work to identify those responsible for this outrageous, reckless and barbaric act," said the Metropolitan Police's Basu on Monday.

Basu said that, while he cannot "offer guarantees," the "risk to the general public at this time remains low."

According to Basu, 21 people have presented with health concerns, but all have been screened and given the "all clear."

Among those 21 was a police officer who sought medical advice Saturday in connection with the investigation.

A very rare nerve agent

Nerve agents kill by affecting the nervous system in various ways.

Novichok, which works by causing a slowing of the heart and restriction of the airways, is one of the world's rarest nerve agents . Very few people outside Russia have experience with it.

It was developed in secret by the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s as a means of countering US defenses against chemical weapons, but was revealed to the world by former Soviet scientist and whistleblower Vil Mirzayanov.

Mirzayanov told CNN that Novichok is up to 10 times as potent as VX, the weapon used to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half-brother, Kim Jong Nam , in 2017.
__label__politics (CNN) Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter and his wife, Margaret, routinely -- and illegally -- used campaign funds to pay personal bills big and small, from luxury vacations to kids' school lunches and delinquent family dentistry bills, according to a stinging 47-page indictment unsealed Tuesday.

The charges of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign finance violations and conspiracy were the culmination of a Department of Justice investigation that has stretched for more than a year, during which the Republican congressman from California has maintained his innocence.

The detailed indictment portrays the Hunters as living well beyond their means and said they "knowingly conspired with each other" to convert campaign funds to personal use.

Federal prosecutors contend that the Hunters repeatedly misrepresented what their expenses were for -- in one instance buying personal clothing at a golf course so that the purchase "could be falsely reported to the treasurer as 'balls for the wounded warriors,'" the indictment says.

The indictment also charges that Duncan Hunter facilitated the "theft of campaign funds" by directing his treasurer to obtain a campaign credit card for his wife at a time when she had no formal role.

The congressman then insisted that his wife be named as his paid campaign manager -- over the objections of his treasurer -- because, according to the document, he said the family needed "the extra money that would come from her salary."

Prosecutors said Hunter also allowed the alleged theft to take place by "ignoring his campaign staff's multiple warnings about Margaret Hunter's improper use of campaign funds." He lashed out at aides, the indictment says, by accusing them of disloyalty and "trying to create some kind of paper trail on me."

The indictment makes it clear that the Hunters were in dire financial straits and could not have supported their lifestyle without the use of those campaign funds.

The Hunters overdrew their personal bank accounts more 1,100 times in a seven-year period, according to the indictment from the US Attorney's Office in San Diego, resulting in $37,761 in "overdraft" and "insufficient funds" bank fees.

"By virtue of these delinquencies -- as well as notifications of outstanding debts and overdue payments from their children's school, their family dentist, and other creditors -- the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could only be made by using campaign funds," the indictment says.

The Justice Department said the Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in federal court in San Diego.

A spokesperson for Duncan Hunter said the congressman believes the indictment against him and his wife is "purely politically motivated."

Hunter's team asked DOJ to recuse two prosecutors who they say attended a Clinton campaign event in La Jolla. According to letters to DOJ released by Hunter's team, US Attorney Adam Braverman determined recusal was not necessary.

A letter to US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein accuses DOJ of a truncated process and timing that will "hand" Democrats a victory in Hunter's Republican district.

Multiple sources familiar with the case tell CNN that the decision to indict was made by Braverman, who was appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year. Assistant US attorneys act at Braverman's direction and there's no connection between this case and the 2016 presidential election.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the US attorney's office said, "The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the Department of Justice in Washington, DC reviewed and rejected Mr. Hunter's complaints. The prosecutors attended the event at the invitation of the Secret Service. The Secret Service, for many years, has routinely invited prosecutors to attend events involving their protectees in support of the Service's law enforcement mission."

Republican Party leaders had long worried that with a potential indictment looming, Hunter's traditionally safe district, which makes up much of eastern San Diego County, could be at risk of Democratic takeover in November's midterm election.

Senior White House officials were aware of the impending announcement and bracing for the Hunter news to join a slew of bad news stories that have hit the White House all at once, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Hunter was a founding member of the "Trump Caucus" in the House during the 2016 campaign, and alongside Rep. Chris Collins, was the first of two sitting congressmen to endorse Trump for President back in February 2016. Collins was indicted earlier this month on insider trading charges.

In a statement on Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the charges against Duncan "deeply serious" and said he will be removed from his committee assignments "pending the resolution of this matter."

Rep. Steve Stivers, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement, "These are troubling charges leveled against Congressman Hunter. I trust our judicial system and eagerly await more facts surrounding the case."

Allegations of lavish spending

Hunter's campaign credit card allowed the family to take lavish vacations that they could not otherwise afford, according to the indictment filed Tuesday in federal court in San Diego.

Investigators found that Margaret Hunter concealed the name or location of their destination by purchasing tickets for personal vacations by using websites like Expedia. Among the trips using campaign funds: a 2015 family vacation in Italy over Thanksgiving totaling more than $14,000; an April vacation in Hawaii costing $6,500; and a $3,700 trip to Las Vegas and Boise in July 2015.

In addition to family trips to fast food and fine dining establishments, as well as venues like the Del Mar Racetrack, the Hunters allegedly also spent thousands of dollars of campaign funds on routine purchases for personal items at Costco ($11,300), Walmart (more than $5,700), Barnes & Noble, Target and Michael's craft store.

In one of Margaret Hunter's trips to Target, she allegedly spent more than $300 in campaign funds for "a tablecloth, three square pillows, a three-brush set, a metal tray, four temporary shades, four window panels, a white duck, two Punky Brewster items, a ring pop and two five-packs of animals," according to court documents. She described the purchases as being needed for "teacher/parent & supporter events."

Hunter repeatedly pushed back on inquiries from his treasurer about his and his wife's spending. For example, the Hunters allegedly spent nearly $2,000 on a November 2010 birthday gift for a family member to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game at Heinz Field. When questioned by his treasurer about whether the expense was campaign related, the congressman gave a curt response: "Yessir."

When the treasurer explicitly told the congressman in December 2010 that he could not use campaign funds "for a leisure outing at which the discussion occasionally focuses on the campaign," Hunter asked the treasurer if he was "trying to create some kind of paper trail" on him.

When the treasurer threatened to resign, Hunter promised that he would instruct his wife not to use the campaign credit card and put it in a safe place.

The indictment underscores that the Hunters also spent campaign money to entertain friends, family members and associates, many of whom are not named in the court documents.

In one instance in January 2010, the congressman allegedly spent more than $1,000 for a three-night stay at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for what was described as a "personal ski trip" with a person identified in the indictment only as "Individual 14."

The indictment states that in June 2011, Hunter used $162 in campaign funds "for a personal stay at the Liaison Capitol Hill hotel with Individual 14."

When the campaign fell short at the end of 2012, and the treasurer informed Hunter they could not pay outstanding bills, Hunter allegedly told his aide that he would raise between $11,000 and $15,000 from campaign donors to address the shortfall by the middle of the next month.

Hunter, a former Marine, has reimbursed his campaign account some $65,000 since the Federal Election Commission first questioned spending on video games in 2016, according to FEC records.

"There was wrong campaign spending, but it was not done by me," Hunter told KGTV-10, a San Diego television station, earlier this year.

Hunter's lawyers said last year that "any mistakes were made they were strictly inadvertent and unintentional."

Re-election fight

California's 50th District is a staunchly Republican district with many current and former military families. The congressman's father, Duncan L. Hunter, represented parts of the district (which changed after redistricting) and has rallied donors and supporters to his son's side.

Hunter's Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a former Department of Labor aide in the Obama administration, has repeatedly outraised him.

Many Hunter allies believe he will stay in his House seat while fighting the charges.

Even if federal candidates choose to withdraw from contention, their names will remain on the ballot unless they seek removal of their names from a judge, according to the California Secretary of State's Office.

At this late juncture, there is no possibility of a write-in campaign. Only Hunter and Campa-Najjar will appear on the November ballot, since they were the top vote-getters in California's top-two primary in June.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The late Sen. John McCain is remembered for his decades-long tenure serving as a maverick Republican in the Senate, but former Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle recalled to CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash how the Arizona senator nearly went so far as to leave the party and caucus with Democrats.

McCain, who died Saturday at 81, began negotiations to break from the GOP following his failed 2000 presidential run amid efforts by both Republicans and Democrats to gain the majority in an evenly split, 50/50 Senate.

"It was after the election. Of course, we went through a very tumultuous period when we weren't sure just how this is all going to sort out. And if you recall, we were -- it was the first 50/50 Senate. And so, we were trying to figure out how you govern with a 50/50 Senate," Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat who became Senate majority leader in 2001, said in September 2017.

In 2001, The Washington Post detailed the rifts between McCain's camp and George W. Bush's team. McCain thought Bush authorized political attacks against his Vietnam War credentials and social values, including a malicious rumor about his adopted daughter . McCain's team also thought they were being prevented from getting jobs in the Bush administration.

"I think he was upset because I think he thought the primary process was very, in some ways even painful, very frustrating, didn't think he was dealt with fairly. It started with that, but I think there were also some personality issues within the caucus itself," Daschle said.

__label__politics (CNN) In a move that could heighten tensions between Washington and Beijing, two US Navy destroyers have sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a US Navy official has confirmed to CNN.

The warships, the USS Mustin and USS Benfold, headed north, the official said, and are the first American warships to pass through the strait since July 2017, when the USS John S. McCain made the transit. The move, which several news outlets have reported, comes amid increasing strain between the Trump administration and China over trade, North Korea and the South China Sea.

Pacific Fleet spokesman Capt. Charlie Brown called the passage of the ships "a routine transit."

"US Navy ships transit between the South China Sea and East China Sea via the Taiwan Strait, and have done so for many years," Brown said.

Beijing is perceived as sensitive to US military vessels traveling through the strait and continues to lay claim to Taiwan, a self-governed, democratic island, which it views as a breakaway province. The US Navy has not sailed an aircraft carrier in that area since 2007.

__label__world (CNN) For the first time in almost a year, ISIS has released what it says is a new audio message from its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

In the message, the man on the recording admits that ISIS groups are losing and that it is a test from Allah, saying they need to stick together.

The man says his followers are being tested with "fear and hunger" but says "glad tidings" will be given to those who "patiently persevere."

The audio message was published by ISIS media wing al-Furqan on Wednesday.

CNN cannot independently confirm the voice on the recording is that of al-Baghdadi.

"US Central Command is aware of the alleged audio recording," Central Command spokesperson Capt. William Urban said. "I am not going to comment on our assessment of the recording. We do not know where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is at this time, but he continues to be someone that we are interested in removing from the battlefield.

"I do not believe that any official US government source has ever claimed that he is dead." When asked whether that meant US officials believe the ISIS leader is alive, Urban said, "Yes."

JUST WATCHED Officials: ISIS leader wounded by airstrike last year Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Officials: ISIS leader wounded by airstrike last year 02:23

If it is from Baghdadi, this is the first audio message from him to be released since the fall of Raqqa in October 2017, as ISIS-held land in Syria continues to dwindle.

The man in the recording references massive losses by ISIS. "For the believer Mujahideen, the scale of victory or defeat is not counting on a city or town being stolen or subject to those who have aerial superiority, or intercontinental missiles or smart bombs, and not how many followers they have," he says.

"The scale depends on how much faith the worshipper has," he adds.

The audio recording runs for about 55 minutes.

The speaker makes reference to recent events, including tensions between the United States and Turkey. He refers to the sanctions the United States imposed on Turkey on August 1, "just to release the pastor," referring to US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is detained in Turkey.

The man also says Russia and Iran are seeking to revolt against sanctions and avoid a similar situation to North Korea. The voice says America is using "the gang policy" and it is a "sign of weakness."

The man mentions the Syrian city of Idlib, saying Russian and Syrian military are about to storm it "with the help of traitors," a reference to some Syrian rebels. And the speaker calls on Sunni Muslims to topple the government of Jordan, which is an ally of the United States and the United Kingdom.

The speaker also gave his blessing to "lone wolves in the lands of crusaders in Canada, Europe and elsewhere for their work in supporting their brothers," and called on ISIS supporters to carry out similar, simple attacks: "A bullet or a stab or a bomb would be worth a thousand operations. And don't forget to drive into crowds in the streets."

Rare messages

Baghdadi has made only one public appearance, in July 2014, in the al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul, which was retaken by Iraqi security forces in June last year.

ISIS has since released various audio messages that it claims are from Baghdadi -- most recently, one in September 2017 that appeared to make reference to news events that happened after Russia claimed he was dead.

In February, several US officials who spoke exclusively to CNN said he had been wounded in an airstrike in May 2017 and had to relinquish control of the terror group for up to five months because of his injuries. The assessment of US intelligence agencies was based on reports from ISIS detainees and refugees in Northern Syria that emerged months after the airstrike, the officials added.

It's believed the airstrike occurred close to the date offered by the Russian military in June, when they claimed to have killed or injured the ISIS leader.

At the time, Russia's Defense Ministry said it was investigating reports Baghdadi had been killed in an airstrike on May 28, on the outskirts of Raqqa, the group's primary stronghold, which US-backed forces took back in October.

Analysts warned at the time that reports of Baghdadi's death should be treated with skepticism given the high number of previous false reports.
__label__world (CNN) A report on modern slavery around the world has found that the number of slaves in developed nations, including the United States and United Kingdom, is much higher than previously thought.

The Global Slavery Index is published annually by the Walk Free Foundation. Last year, the Walk Free Foundation worked with the International Labor Organization to produce a report that estimated there were 40.3 million slaves worldwide , but didn't give figures for individual countries.

In its new report, Walk Free Foundation is still using the 40.3 million figure, but says that improvements in its methodology mean it can estimate country-level figures more accurately than ever before: it now estimates that in the United States 403,000 people -- or 1 in every 800 -- are living in modern slavery, seven-times higher than it previously believed.

In the UK, it estimates there are 136,000 slaves, almost 12-times higher than previous figures.

The numbers contrast with UK government's most recent estimate that there were between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims of modern slavery in the UK in 2013. There is no equivalent government figure for the US.

Dramatic increases

The Index defines modern slavery as an umbrella term that refers to "situations of exploitation that a person cannot refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, abuse of power, or deception." This incorporates various forms of slavery, including sexual exploitation, forced labor, child labor, and forced marriage.

Walk Free Foundation says the reason for the dramatic increases in its slavery estimates for some countries is that the latest report uses far more data sources than previously.

The figures draw on surveys carried out in 48 countries (nearly twice the number of countries as in previous years) and face-to-face interviews with 70,000 people.

"We're now measuring where a person was enslaved, as opposed to where they were interviewed or where we discovered their slavery," Walk Free Foundation founder Andrew Forrest told CNN.

JUST WATCHED Trafficking survivor wants to end 'The Game' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trafficking survivor wants to end 'The Game' 04:01

As a result, the slavery estimates for other countries, including Australia, France, the Netherlands and other European nations, have increased. However, the report notes that these countries are also those whose governments are doing most to tackle the problem.

For example, the report lists the US as a world leader in addressing forced labor in supply chains and the UK also requires business to report on the measures they are taking to tackle forced labor in their supply chains.

Forrest explained that the increased accuracy means the Index now estimates the number of slaves in a country today, whereas previously, its figures were for the number of slaves in a country over a five-year period.

The change in methodology also means that some countries have seen their slavery figures greatly reduced. Walk Free's estimates for the number of slaves in India, for example, has fallen to 8 million, from 18.4 million in its 2016 report.

North Korea has highest prevalence

The Index found that, as in its 2016 edition, North Korea has the highest prevalence of modern slavery in the world, with an estimated one in 10 people (2.6 million) forced to work.

It is followed by Eritrea, Burundi, the Central African Republic and Afghanistan, countries that the report notes suffer from conflict and oppressive regimes.

The Walk Free Foundation, a global human rights organization with a mission to end modern slavery in a generation, was founded by Australian philanthropists, Andrew and Nicola Forrest.

Some have criticized the methodology behind the Index, which extrapolates its figures based on various risk factors and a "Vulnerability Model."

Walk Free notes that, because of the changes to its methodology, the national slavery figures are not comparable with previous editions of the Global Slavery Index.

It says: "As such, while comparability from previous years is lost, the changes are justified by the need to continually improve our knowledge base."
__label__world Kerala, India (CNN) Dharamvir Singh is the leader of a team of six men tackling their latest tough assignment in the flood-ravaged southern Indian state of Kerala.

Their mission is to safely evacuate stranded residents and to deliver supplies to desperate flood victims who have been without food and clean water for days.

Members of the Indian government's National Disaster Response Force are working to reach isolated pockets of people after deadly flash floods devastated the region's idyllic countryside.

Singh holds the rope of an inflatable orange dinghy as the team makes its way through a stew of river water and sewage that's now become a cesspool of infection.

His team draws on years of training as they navigate the dinghy through narrow streets that are filled with up to six feet of filthy water.

"Rescuers have to become friends with water. Otherwise they can't rescue anyone successfully," said Singh.

In the small town of Peringara, in the Thiruvalla district, water flooded hundreds of houses with no warning Wednesday. Banana trees are split down the middle and their leaves float forlornly in the water, walls have crumbled and cars filled with water are sitting abandoned in the streets.

Ground floors flooded in an hour

"In the morning water started coming in. The water was [up to] our necks. We could not even collect our belongings," said Girija, who goes only by her first name.

A house is partially submerged in flood waters in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sunday, August 19.

In one hour, water filled up the ground floor of most houses in the town. People scrambled to get onto the first floor, if they had one or the roof. No one in the town remembers a flood like this.

By Thursday, locals began navigating through the water looking for people who may need to be evacuated.

Prashant M. built a makeshift raft out of the trunk of banana trees lashed together with ropes. Volunteers pulled the raft along carrying big steel or plastic water tubs. Each could hold two or three people.

"We have a big pot. They sit in it and on the raft and as we wade through the water, we pull them behind us with ropes," said Prashant.

Local residents carry a young boy to safety in a steel tub that is used to cook food.

By the next day, the NDRF team had arrived in the town. Their first assignment -- locate an elderly man locals said was in the middle of nowhere and deliver an oxygen tank. It was 2:30 a.m.

"He was on his last tank and running out of oxygen. We had to reach him somehow," said Singh.

It took the team hours -- but they reached him in in time.

Inflatable craft the only option

Dozens of teams like Singh's have been deployed across the state over the last few days. In areas that are inaccessible by foot or by air, inflatable dinghies are the only option.

An Indian policeman, left, and a volunteer carry essential supplies for stranded people in a flooded area in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sunday, August 19.

The men locate a safe spot and begin inflating the small boats. They are equipped with a motor that works only if there is more than four feet water. For water below that level, the men leap out of the dinghy, grab ropes and start pulling it along.

Kerala is a state filled with rivers. Usually, those rivers provide it with a natural beauty that inspires millions of tourists to visit the land, commonly known as, "God's own country."

Today, those same rivers have ruined hundreds of thousands of homes and claimed more than 230 lives in less than two weeks.

The swollen waters have spilled out into fields and playgrounds. It is hard to differentiate where the roads end and the rivers begin, except when the men shout that the water is deep and they slip and slide into the dinghies, with palpable relief on their faces and start the motor. This gives them a few minutes of respite before the dinghy scrapes against a speed bump or the road and the laborious process begins all over again.

Singh and his team have been navigating through the waters and take the help of locals who point out the best way forward -- a way where there are no fallen trees, no barbed wire guarding the fields and most importantly, no strong currents.

At one point, the tiny boat swings madly as water rushes out of the river and is sucked into a low-lying street on the other side. Singh throws a foot at the wall, trying to stabilize the boat and flips over into the water. His men shout and he emerges, soaking wet but still issues instructions as he draws deep breaths.

Mission worth separation from family

It is a hard job that requires physical strength and perseverance, something these men do not lack. Working through floods across India over the past seven years, Singh loves being on duty. He considers himself lucky.

An Indian air-force helicopter on rescue mission flies through a flooded area in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sunday, August 19.

Every year, he operates in flood-hit areas for a few weeks, separated from his wife and two children. His mission makes it worth it, he said. Saving lives is not the usual government desk job, he added with a smile.

The team reaches a local health center located deep inside the town. More than 100 people have sought refuge there with a few belongings. The smell of disinfectant, stale water and disease lies heavy in the air.

Women prepare lunch at a temporary relief camp set up in a local health center in Kerala.

There is no bathroom, there is no clean drinking water or sanitary pads for women. A group of women dressed in nighties stand and cook rice soup for everyone.

The team carries six people in need of medical help down a flight of stairs and gently place them in the dinghy. Life jackets are tightened, the people are reassured that they are safe and going to a better place. And then the motor whirs into life and the dinghy takes off.

Singh directs his men to return to their original location -- where a shipment of relief material is waiting and the team will make their way back into the flooded town for a third time in 36 hours. On shift for the past ten hours, none of them knows when they will get to sleep next.
__label__politics (CNN) On Friday morning, at a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda honoring the late John McCain , Vice President Mike Pence quoted Donald Trump on the late Arizona senator: "As President Trump said yesterday, we respect his service to the country."

Oh, that's nice!, you might think, listening to Pence. I know Trump and McCain didn't get along in life and Trump did the whole flags-at-full-staff thing but I'm glad Trump took the high road -- even if it took him a little while to get there.

Unfortunately, you would be wrong.

The quote that Pence read from Trump is a partial quote. Here's the whole exchange and Trump's quote, from an interview he did with Bloomberg on Thursday

BLOOMBERG: "Mr. President, as you know, of course John McCain's remains are on -- on -- on their way back to Washington now. You had an opportunity to unite the country this week. I'm just wondering if you felt like you screwed it up?"

TRUMP: "No, I don't think I did at all. I -- I've -- I've done everything that they requested, and no, I don't think I have at all. You know, we had our disagreements and they were very strong disagreements. I disagreed with many of the things that I assume he believed in."

"But with that being said, I respect his service to the country."

BLOOMBERG: "Would he -- would McCain have been a better president than Obama?"

TRUMP: "I don't want to comment on it. I have a very strong opinion on it."

BLOOMBERG: "Ooh. We would love to know."

TRUMP: "I have a very strong..."

BLOOMBERG: "That's not -- that's not a terrible question, that..."

TRUMP: "I have a very strong -- Sarah, she's just having a nervous breakdown."

TRUMP: "I have a very strong opinion on it."

BLOOMBERG: "But you want to -- you want to keep that to yourself."

TRUMP: "Maybe I'll give you that answer someday later. Yes. But I have a very strong opinion on that."

Let's start with the beginning of the quote that Pence read. In full, it reads: "You know, we had our disagreements and they were very strong disagreements. I disagreed with many of the things that I assume he believed in. But with that being said, I respect his service to the country."

What we learn from that quote is:

1. Trump and McCain had "very strong disagreements"

2. Trump disagreed with lots of things McCain said he believed in (low-key shade there)

3. Trump respects McCain's service -- or whatever.

Disagree with my third point? Think of it in this context. You ask me whether Karl Malone was a truly great basketball player. I respond this way: "Look, I know lots of people think he is a great player. I disagreed with those people. But with that being said, he scored a lot of points and I respect that he is in the Hall of Fame."

Would you leave that conversation thinking: "Man. Chris really appreciates Karl Malone's greatness?" Of course not. Same goes for Trump.

Then there's the way Trump "answers" the next question as to whether McCain would have made a better president than Barack Obama, had the Republican won in 2008.

"I don't want to comment on it," Trump responded. "I have a very strong opinion on it."

Ask yourself: What "very strong opinion" could Trump have on that question that a) he wouldn't be able to share and b) would give White House press secretary Sarah Sanders a "nervous breakdown?" Surely Trump saying that McCain would have made a better president than Obama wouldn't cause that sort of reaction, right?

Trump knows that. He knows that by not answering the question the way he did, he is making very clear that he does not in fact think that McCain would have been a better president than Obama. That's really something given that Trump, in August 2016, tweeted this about Obama : "President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!"

If only because Trump is a sitting Republican president who has spent YEARS criticizing every aspect of his predecessor's record, it is utterly baffling that he can't even say whether McCain, his party's 2008 nominee, would have done a better job.

The lack of grace from Trump in this moment is truly remarkable. That Trump gave that interview even as McCain's body was being flown from Arizona to Washington, DC, to be honored goes beyond gracelessness into something darker. That we are talking about the President of the United States behaving like this is almost beyond comprehension.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) It's impossible to know in the moment when a presidency begins to dissolve. But after a devastating 48 hours, it's already clear that Donald Trump's will never be the same.

Whatever your view of Trump, his behavior and his presidency, Washington is watching the opening act of a stunning attempt to topple the elected leader of the nation.

Damaging twin portraits of the President in a New York Times op-ed and Bob Woodward's new book are using the words of current top officials to fracture the mythology of vanity and bombast, conmanship and intimidation of Trump's personality cult.

In an attack from an enemy within, top officials who see Trump up close, including one calling the band of renegades the "resistance," are finally daring to say -- albeit under Washington's invisibility cloak of anonymity -- what outside critics have long believed.

They warn the President of the United States is not only unfit to be the most powerful man in the world, but is a venal mix of ignorance and ego, pettiness, malignancy and recklessness that is putting the republic and the world itself at risk.

For all his boasts of historic success and self-image as a strongman's strongman, the "adults in the room" want Americans to know: the emperor has no clothes.

"The root of the problem is the President's amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making," the unnamed official wrote in the staggering essay published by the Times

The official even revealed there had even been talk among Cabinet officers about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President. Washington has seen almost everything under Trump, but a palace coup would be something else.

"There is somebody working for the President of the United States at a very senior level who is trying to destroy him," Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

It's hard to find a parallel in Western political history for a leader to survive such a knifing since the power and fear need to sustain iron rule can slip away especially quickly in a democracy -- as opposed to an autocratic state.

But Trump has long defied predictions of his own demise and survived the kind of blows that would paralyze other presidents. Yet no other commander in chief has faced the staggering personal disavowals and devastating betrayals that he has endured this week.

TREASON? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2018

Like a wounded king's furious wail, Trump tweeted a single word: "TREASON?"

Woodward was just the start

The legendary muckraker's deeply reported account exposes profound disdain for the President among senior officials who are said to view him as an "idiot" with a fifth-grade education who the world needs protecting against.

It turns out Woodward was just the appetizer.

The thunderclap of the Times piece laid bare an administration in disarray, a President dangerously off the rails and a nation adrift without the stable hand of an effective leader.

"Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations," the official wrote.

"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room ... this isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state."

The effect of the op-ed was to validate many of the claims of a President dangerously out of his depth that were made by Woodward, crushing White House efforts to fight back.

Washington is already getting consumed with speculation about who wrote the op-ed, the city's biggest literary whodunit since the 1996 novel "Primary Colors," loosely based on the Clintons, was revealed as the work of Joe Klein.

Then there is a quickening debate over the decision of the author to stay in the shadows and whether the person should demonstrate their courage of convictions by resigning and revealing their name.

Unimaginable questions

But Wednesday's staggering events -- extraordinary even by the convention-blasting standards of Trump, pose questions that would once have been unimaginable.

They include: What will happen if, as it appears, America does not have a stable, functioning President? Will the mutiny among unidentified senior officials build and will they break cover, provoke resignations, or further shred the fabric of the administration?

There is of course the perennial question of whether cowed Republicans on Capitol Hill will be moved to even discuss the crisis of competence and temperance raging in the White House. Then there is the issue of whether a crisis-addled and demoralized White House will dampen GOP turnout in midterm elections where a defeat could shatter the bond between Trump and his party.

What must it be like to work in the confines of the West Wing, with a raging President, a cabal of officials working against him and the destabilizing spectacle of a witch hunt to find the moles?

Will the President, seeing betrayal at every turn, launch a purge of officials he suspects may not be loyal to his political crusade, further thinning the ranks of a threadbare White House?

His darkest hour

JUST WATCHED Trump responds to op-ed: 'Gutless' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump responds to op-ed: 'Gutless' 02:01

Trump tried to find his way out of his darkest hour to date by trying to wrest control of his own fate.

He appeared in the East Room of the White House in an extraordinary display of defiance soon after The New York Times op-ed appeared.

His appearance was almost noble, though also steeped in pathos, as a wounded leader fought against unseen forces bent on his demise even as he tasted the bile of betrayal that may always have been the inevitable result of his erratic rule.

"The failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial -- can you believe it?" Trump told a gathering of sheriffs.

"Anonymous -- meaning gutless. A gutless editorial," the President said, in an appearance in which he laid claim to a record of staggering political success, a roaring economy and building military might.

Later, his mood had darkened and he delivered a truly sinister tweet.

Does the so-called "Senior Administration Official" really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source? If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2018

"Does the so-called 'Senior Administration Official' really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source? If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!" Trump wrote.

The President will step up his counter-attack when he hits the campaign trail in Montana on Thursday night. He is sure of a warm welcome from loyal supporters and the treachery and betrayal of Washington may not resonate so much in Trump country.

As Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: "In my world, where I live in South Carolina, most people are very pleased with what the President is doing," adding that Woodward and The New York Times did not cut much ice among his voters.

But make no mistake, in Washington at least, Trump is fighting for his presidency, against forces trying to tear it down from within.
__label__world Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) A car bombing on Sunday morning in Mogadishu, Somalia, has left at least six people dead and 15 others wounded, according to a city official.

The attack targeted local government offices, according to Salah Hassan Omar, a spokesman for the city of Mogadishu.

Three Somali soldiers are among the dead, according to Col. Aden Dahir of the Somali military.

The soldiers were killed while attempting to stop the speeding vehicle before it detonated around 9 a.m. local time, sending a powerful blast ripping through the government building and other nearby buildings, including a mosque.

The terrorist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack through its media channel, Andalus Radio.

__label__politics (CNN) It sounds like the kind of legislation that should easily breeze through a statehouse, even in these politically divided times: a resolution denouncing white nationalists and neo-Nazis .

It didn't even make it out of committee in the Tennessee legislature.

"[W]e urge law enforcement to recognize these white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups as terrorist organizations and to pursue the criminal elements of these domestic terrorist organizations in the same manner and with the same fervor used to protect the United States from other manifestations of terrorism."

But when it came up Wednesday before the House State Government Subcommittee , it died a quick death. How quick? About 36 seconds

As Clemmons started to talk about the bill, the sole Democrat on the five-member committee motioned to have it discussed.

No one on the committee spoke up. The committee chair, Republican state Rep. Bill Sanderson, then gaveled the resolution dead

And with that the committee moved on to the next item on its agenda.

Because the resolution didn't get a second motion to proceed, it means it won't make it to a vote by the full legislature.

'Why, I can't begin to imagine'

Clemmons can't understand how something so non-controversial couldn't even get out of committee.

"Why, I can't begin to imagine," he told CNN affiliate WZTV . "What example does this set for children when their own state won't denounce acts of violence by hate groups? We have blown a tremendous opportunity."

Sanderson hadn't responded to CNN requests for comment, but another Republican member of the committee, state Rep. Bob Ramsey, told WZTV that they didn't have enough information on neo-Nazis or white supremacy to be able to talk about it.

"We have no expertise on it," he said. "How could we determine these groups are terrorists? We don't know the federal guidelines on terrorism."

The reason for the objection

Later, in a statement to CNN, Ramsey said the committee agreed with Clemmons "on the intent and philosophy of the resolution." The objection was to "the designation of 'terrorist organization.'"

"In the past two sessions, our Committee has had several resolutions from various political parties, aimed at special prosecutors, designations of terrorist organizations, condemnation of religious sites and practices, and celebration of controversial historical sites, figures, or organizations. These subjects seem simple but have initiated some of the most bitter decisiveness and debates I have ever witnessed. They usually result in a retaliatory resolution from the other side."

The committee could bring the resolution back up if it's reworded, Ramsey said.

Clemmons told CNN on Friday afternoon he's open to running the resolution by the committee again. But he doesn't see what is so controversial about it.

"There's nothing partisan about this resolution," he said. "This is just them trying to do a 180 because there's been a public outcry."

__label__politics Story highlights Several of Trump's North Carolina rallies have been marked by violence against protesters

It was not immediately clear if anyone was arrested in the scuffle

Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) A protester at a Donald Trump rally on Friday was shoved and put in a headlock by supporters of the Republican nominee.

The altercation, just the latest incident of violence against protesters at Trump rallies, came moments after Trump pointed directly at the protester and told him to "get out!"

Trump supporters began shouting at the man before one male Trump supporter and then another began shoving the protester, who was holding an American flag upside down.

A third man wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat and a "Gays for Trump" shirt then forcefully grabbed the protester and began rushing him toward the exit. The protester briefly escaped the man's grasp, but the Trump supporter quickly put the protester in a headlock.

As the two men scrapped, a police officer intervened to break up the scuffle and escorted the protester out of the venue.

__label__politics (CNN) US President Donald Trump, facing scrutiny for hush money payments to a porn star and a former Playboy model, pleaded with evangelical leaders for political help during closed-door remarks on Monday, warning of dire consequences to their congregations should Republicans lose in November's midterm elections.

"This November 6 election is very much a referendum on not only me, it's a referendum on your religion, it's a referendum on free speech and the First Amendment. It's a referendum on so much," Trump told the assemblage of pastors and other Christian leaders gathered in the State Dining Room, according to a recording from people in the room.

"It's not a question of like or dislike, it's a question that they will overturn everything that we've done and they will do it quickly and violently. And violently. There is violence. When you look at Antifa -- these are violent people," Trump said, describing what would happen should his voters fail to cast ballots. "You have tremendous power. You were saying, in this room, you have people who preach to almost 200 million people. Depending on which Sunday we're talking about."

Antifa -- a loose collection of anti-fascist groups who regularly stage counter-protests against white supremacists and neo-Nazis -- have emerged as an effective bogeyman for segments of the US right.

In a video released last year by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the pro-gun group used footage from street protests and occasional Antifa violence to paint all on the US left as seeking to "bully and terrorize the law-abiding."

__label__world Christiane Amanpour is CNN's chief international correspondent. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

On this World Press Freedom Day, we only have to look back to the horrors that took place on Monday in Afghanistan to remind ourselves just how dangerous it is to be a reporter.

It was rush hour in Kabul when a bomb blast went off. As all journalists do, they picked up their gear and went to cover the story.

As they gathered on scene, another man, posing as a reporter, entered the group and detonated. It was the work of ISIS. Seven were immediately killed; two others died later. With their deaths, the world lost a critical window into Afghanistan. This New York Times obituary of the veteran Afghan photographer Shah Marai lays out the deep human tragedy.

"Through it all," wrote Mujib Mashal, Marai "continued to bear witness, focusing his camera on the profound human suffering that has become so routine, so forgotten."

The Committee to Protect Journalists, of which I am an honorary board member, tracks statistics like deaths and imprisonments among journalists.

It reports that 24 have been killed already this year, including Ahmed Abu Hussein, a Palestinian photojournalist who was shot by Israeli troops last month as he was covering a protest in Gaza, wearing a vest clearly marked "PRESS". "

Protective gear that clearly indicates individuals are members of the press should afford them extra protection -- not make them targets," says Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East Coordinator.

When it comes to imprisonments, the statistics are also shocking. CPJ says a total of 262 reporters were behind bars last year, with plenty of others living under threat of incarceration. CPJ ranks Turkey as the world's worst jailer of journalists, with 73 reporters currently locked up.

JUST WATCHED Dozens killed in Kabul suicide blast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dozens killed in Kabul suicide blast 01:35

Despite the constant fear of imprisonment, Turkish journalists are still speaking out. One reporter, Hakki Boltan, told Amnesty International: "For journalists, Turkey has become a dungeon."

Another, Cagdas Kaplan says: "Working under constant threat of arrest and conviction makes life extremely difficult, but journalism is our profession. We have to carry it out."

As UNESCO special ambassador for Press freedom and safety, I am keenly aware that press freedom issues are not limited to any one region or type of government.

In fact, Reporters without Borders just released its annual World Press Freedom index, and it shows both the United Kingdom and the United States slid two levels in the rankings. The UK dropped to number 40, while the U.S. sunk to 45. This puts both countries behind places like Ghana, Slovakia and Uruguay.

Developments in the United States have been particularly troubling. Reporters without Borders says that Washington slid down the list due to a "series of verbal attacks toward journalists, attempts to block the White House access to multiple media outlets, routine use of the term 'fake news' in retaliation for critical reporting, and calling for media outlets broadcasting licenses to be revoked."

There is a lot to be concerned about over the current climate of press freedom, but I do have hope. As a journalist for nearly 35-years at CNN, I've worked with hundreds of other reporters. And one thing I know is that everyone in this profession possesses a tenacity and a fearlessness that can't be taught.

Despite the horror of what happened in Kabul, and ever-tightening censorship all over the globe, I know journalists everywhere will continue to pick up their gear, go out, and cover the important stories -- even if it means they themselves could become targets.

This is something to be both celebrated and protected on this World Press Freedom Day.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Washington lobbyist W. Samuel Patten pleaded guilty Friday to acting as an unregistered foreign lobbyist, and admitted to lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee and funneling a Ukrainian oligarch's money to Donald Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee.

Patten's plea and cooperation agreement is connected to special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election and coordination with the Trump campaign -- even apparently reaching into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's inner circle in Ukraine.

This is the first time the Justice Department has publicly charged a person for helping a foreigner secretly funnel money into a Trump political event. Under his deal with prosecutors, Patten is charged only with one criminal count. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the felony charge. A sentencing date has not been set.

Patten sought tickets to Trump's inauguration on behalf of an unnamed prominent Ukrainian oligarch, according to court documents released Friday, ultimately paying $50,000 for four tickets. Patten used another American as a "straw purchaser," funneling the Ukrainian's money secretly to the inaugural committee through a Cypriot bank account.

"Patten was aware at the time that the Presidential Inauguration Committee could not accept money from foreign nationals," prosecutors wrote in the filing.

Rudy Giuliani, the President's lawyer, told reporters Friday Patten's case had nothing to do with his client.

"It turned about to be this irrelevant indictment, where I think Mueller has turned out to be a private prosecutor," Giuliani said. "What does this have to do with President Trump? Not a single thing. It has nothing to do with collusion, some guy who donated to the inauguration? My goodness,they had 500,000 people donate to the inauguration -- every time they get a speeding ticket is Mueller going to do it?"

CNN previously reported that Russian oligarchs have also been questioned about donations to the Trump campaign and inauguration.

Guilty for Lobbying

Overall, Patten, 47, was paid more than $1 million for his Ukrainian opposition bloc work including meeting with members of the executive branch, Senate Foreign Relations Committee members and members of Congress, according to a charging document filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Friday. He also worked with an unnamed Russian -- believed to be former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's close associate Konstantin Kilimnik -- to place op-ed articles in US media in 2017, the Justice Department says.

The plea deal was handled by the DC US Attorney's Office and the Justice Department's National Security Division, not Mueller's team, which is about to take former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to trial on a similar charge.

The criminal charging document does not name Manafort or any of his colleagues in the US and Ukraine, though Patten's efforts from 2014 on may be connected to those efforts.

Kilimnik, a Russian national with ties to the Russian military intelligence group accused of interfering in the presidential election, has close professional ties to both Patten and Manafort as they worked for the same Ukrainian political interests.

Kilimnik was among the alleged co-conspirators that helped Manafort hide his Ukrainian consulting income in foreign bank accounts, according to documents revealed at Manafort's trial for financial crimes earlier this month. Mueller's prosecutors charged Kilimnik and Manafort in June in a separate federal court with witness tampering, after Kilimnik reached out to potential witnesses in Manafort foreign lobbying case. Kilimnik has not entered a plea in his case, because he is living in Moscow, prosecutors say. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the foreign lobbying charges, and those criminal allegations do not reach past 2015.

Kilimnik co-ran a company with Patten, called Begemot Ventures International, according to business records. According to the court filing in the Patten case Friday, Patten and Foreigner A "formed a company in the United States and were 50-50 partners. Beginning in or around 2015, Company A, among other things, advised the Opposition Bloc and members of that part."

As part of his plea, Patten agreed to cooperate with both Mueller's office and prosecutors from the DC US Attorney's Office going forward, including turning over documents and testifying at future grand jury hearings or criminal trials.

Lying to Congress

Patten admitted to lying to the US Senate Intelligence Committee in January this year about the inauguration tickets. While testifying, he attempted to hide his connections to the Ukrainian oligarch and the Russian national with whom he worked, prosecutors said.

Patten "intentionally did not provide" the committee documents related to the Ukrainian oligarch's purchase of four Trump inaugural tickets and lied to the Senate Committee about his foreign lobbying work. He also deleted documents "pertinent to his relationships" with the foreign political interests, according to the Justice Department prosecutors.

Senate intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner said they referred Patten to the Justice Department.

"We can confirm that Mr. Patten produced documents to the Committee and was interviewed by Committee staff," the senators said in a statement. "Due to concerns about certain statements made by Mr. Patten, the Committee made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. While the charge, and resultant plea, do not appear to directly involve our referral, we appreciate their review of this matter."

Court appearance

Patten appeared in court Friday morning before Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the same judge who is handling Manafort's trial that is scheduled to begin next month.

In court, Patten conveyed the air of a solemn man aware of what he had done.

As Berman Jackson asked him several questions about his willfulness to plead guilty and the rights he will waive, Patten answered her slowly and clearly each time: "Yes, your honor," "I understand, your honor," "I do, your honor."

In a blue shirt and navy suit and tie, the lifelong Washingtonian stood before the judge, nodding often as she spoke to him.

Patten only appeared to stumble in his speech when asked for his plea.

"I would -- I plead guilty to the charge," Patten said to the judge.

Berman Jackson confirmed that he had signed every page of his plea agreement and charging documents with "a squiggle."

A prosecutor from the DC US Attorney's Office read the charging document made public Friday before the hearing, almost word for word. He added no new details when describing Patten's criminal offense, though he added the words more than once that Patten "was working as a foreign agent of the Opposition Bloc."

The Ukrainian political party, called the Opposition Bloc, had deep ties to Russia in the period in which Patten represented them, including many allies of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The political party formed from the remnants of Yanukovych's base after he was driven out of Ukraine in 2014 and fled to Russia.

Patten's defense attorney declined to comment following the hearing.

The 35-minute court proceeding was sparsely attended by members of the press and court employees, yet members of Mueller's special counsel's office filled a front row of seats. They were lead Manafort prosecutor Andrew Weissmann and FBI agents Omer Meisel and Brock Domin.

After the hearing ended, Weissmann spent several minutes greeting Patten's defense attorney, Stuart Sears, and two prosecutors from other Justice Department offices on the case. Patten stood waiting with his hands crossed in front of him without a smile, and he shook Meisel's hand.

Spokesmen from the special counsel's office and DC US Attorney's Office declined to comment further about the case.

Patten will not be detained until his sentencing. But he will need to give up his passport and must ask the judge for permission to travel outside the Washington metro area. He also must continue to see a psychiatrist or therapist, which he said he currently does regularly for depression and anxiety treatment, and he must avoid alcohol, the judge ordered.

Berman Jackson also spoke on the rarity of a foreign lobbying prosecution. There is no sentencing guideline for this type of case and no analogous guidelines the court can use to determine Patten's sentence.

"That's a little complicated," Berman Jackson said when discussing his potential sentence. "I don't usually have to go into all that."

The prosecutors and defense will give the court a status update in 60 days on Patten's case.
__label__world (CNN) A photo of a man taking a selfie while emergency personnel were attending to a seriously injured woman on railway tracks has sparked outrage and an ethical debate in Italy.

Journalist Giorgio Lambri captured the scene May 26 from a station platform in Piacenza in northern Italy while reporting on a train hitting a Canadian woman.

Railway police saw a man taking the selfie and asked him to delete the photos before telling him to move away, according to Filippo Sordi Arcelli Fontana, Piacenza's police chief. The man is not under investigation.

The Canadian woman reportedly got out from the wrong side of the train and fell on the tracks. She later had a leg amputated in the hospital.

Lambri, who photographed the scene, wrote an article in local newspaper Libertà with the headline: "The barbarism you don't expect: the 'selfie' in front of a tragedy." He also posted a picture on Facebook.

In an unusual move, Paul wrote Monday morning that he would meet with Trump to discuss allegations that Brennan is "monetizing his security clearance" and "making millions of dollars divulging secrets to mainstream media." The Kentucky Republican added that he would ask Trump to revoke Brennan's clearance.

__label__politics "I made a mistake," Gates testified in his second day on the stand in Manafort's trial. "I regret it, clearly, and I'm taking responsibility for it."

But dubbing it the "secret life of Rick Gates," Manafort's attorney Kevin Downing grilled Gates about the lies he had told and the money he had stolen as part of a strategy to undermine his credibility with the jury and suggest Gates was responsible for the crimes Manafort is accused of.

"This jury is supposed to believe you? After all the lies you've told?" Downing said.

Gates replied that yes, he should be believed over Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

"I'm here to tell the truth. ... Mr. Manafort had the same path. I'm here," Gates said, looking directly at the jury as he made his appeal. "I have taken responsibility. ... I am trying to change."

The cross-examination came after Gates testified that Manafort sought to move money through offshore accounts and that Manafort had recommended a banker who had loaned him money for a position in the Trump administration.

Manafort is charged with 18 counts of tax and banking crimes, and has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Gates, Manafort's former business partner, pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's team.

The trial itself is not about the work Manafort did on the Trump campaign. But Gates' testimony pits two former senior Trump campaign aides against each other. After Manafort left the campaign in August 2016 amid swirling questions about his Ukraine work, Gates stayed on the campaign and later helped found a pro-Trump advocacy group, before he was ultimately forced out, too, as questions mounted about Manafort.

'It was an embezzlement from Mr. Manafort'

Manafort's defense attorney dug into Gates about how he had embezzled from Manafort, accusing him of using an offshore bank account that's part of Manafort's alleged crime.

Downing peppered Gates with questions: Was Gates' wife aware of the account he used to siphon money from Manafort? Yes, Gates said. Was she aware of his "secret life"?

"She was," Gates said.

Downing continued to highlight to the jury, and to Gates, how Gates had embezzled from Manafort, though he initially resisted the term.

"Why won't you say embezzlement?" Downing asked.

"What difference does it make?" Gates said, repeated his phrasing that he had submitted "unauthorized" expense reports to Manafort's company.

"Why won't you say embezzlement?" Downing asked a second time.

"It was an embezzlement from Mr. Manafort," Gates finally said.

The intense exchange, where Gates still refrained from showing much emotion, came after the defense lawyer reviewed almost $200,000 Gates had transferred to his own bank account, listed under the holding company Bade LLC, from one of Manafort's shell companies, Global Endeavor.

Gates admitted at this point during the testimony that "it was Mr. Manafort's money."

"Were these payments for your secret life?" Downing asked.

"The answer is no, they're not," Gates said.

'WTF' emails

Earlier Tuesday, prosecutors walked jurors through an email Manafort had sent Gates two weeks after Trump was elected, in which Trump recommended Stephen Calk as Army secretary. Calk is a banker whose bank allegedly loaned Manafort money on false pretenses, prosecutors say.

"We need to discuss Steve Calk for Sec of Army," Manafort wrote to Gates on Nov. 24, 2016. He signed the email as "P."

In his second day of testimony, Gates detailed their use of foreign accounts as well as Manafort's financial troubles.

Prosecutors showed jurors an April 2015 email exchange between Manafort and Gates discussing higher-than-anticipated taxes, which Gates said succinctly summarized the frustration felt by Manafort.

"WTF," Manafort wrote. "How could I be blindsided like this. You told me you were on top of this. We need to discuss options. This is a disaster."

Moving the accounts

Gates told jurors Tuesday that the "typical practice was Mr. Manafort would send me a list of wire requests." Manafort would also send the wire transfer requests to their Cyprus-based law firm, Gates said.

Prosecutors showed emails between Manafort and Gates that appear to confirm Gates' story that Manafort sought to move money that his consulting company had earned from Ukraine through Cypriot accounts.

"There were hundreds of these," Gates testified.

Gates had written to Manafort about transferring money from one of Manafort's shell companies, Leviathan Advisors Limited, to their aboveboard consulting group, DMP International. "Unless you approve otherwise," Gates ended his note proposing the transfer.

"This works. Proceed as you lay it out below," Manafort wrote back, signing his email with the letter "P."

The subject line of the email was "Payments."

At some point during the European banking crisis, Manafort's law firm in Cyprus that oversaw the legal process of setting up the accounts moved them to the country St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. Around that time, Manafort asked for his name to be removed from the bank account registrations, Gates said. Gates said his name was taken off some but not all legal documents in the foreign country.

Gates said Manafort especially wanted to avoid having his name listed in any documents linked to the accounts because he was embroiled in a lawsuit with someone in Ukraine.

Gates testifies on Manafort's money troubles

Gates described the financial issues that Manafort and his various entities began to experience in 2015 and 2016, describing how vendors would reach out to him and Manafort because "loans had not been paid."

By late 2015, Manafort's consulting group DMP had no clients, according to Gates. He said they were attempting to secure another political consulting contract in Ukraine but had not been able to.

Gates said that during this time he also supplied false information to banks in order to help Manafort secure bank loans. He admitted to altering the profit and loss documents, which he said was per Manafort's direction.

Gates explained how he was hired to work on the Trump campaign, although he did not name Trump. Gates said he was paid for the campaign work through savings and investments from Manafort, though he had additional outside income.

In January 2016 Manafort asked Gates to refinance a property in New York on Howard Street -- a property that Manafort never lived in because he stayed at his Fifth Avenue apartment when he was in the city, but still claimed to use as a second home in order to secure maximum benefits for the mortgage refinance loan, Gates said.

A second email

Another email prosecutors showed and Gates confirmed came in 2015, from the Russian Konstantin Kilimnik to Gates discussing money a Ukrainian client had not yet paid Manafort's firm through the accounts.

At the time, Manafort was dry on cash and beginning to panic, prosecutors say. They have alleged that around this time he was using the hollow foreign accounts to help him reduce the taxes he paid to the US government and defraud at least one bank into giving him a loan.

"This is to calm Paul down," Kilimnik wrote to Gates. "I think the wire will go next week realistically." Gates told the court that "Mr. Manafort was quite upset money had not been sent," and Kilimnik wanted to show the boss they were making the effort.

That contract for 1 million euros, with Ukrainian Sergei Lyovochkin and executed between shell companies both sides used, was never paid in full.

Gates started his testimony Tuesday by getting into the gritty details of how much money each Ukrainian billionaire contracted Manafort for, showcasing exactly how much money was flowing into the hidden Cypriot accounts in 2011 and 2012. It amounted to at least 5 million euros, Gates said.

Working for Manafort, Kilimnik would collect the agreements and execute them, Gates said.

Manafort reported some of the payments to tax authorities in the US as loans -- though they were income, Gates said. He was "trying to decrease his taxable income," Gates said.

Speaking to CNN-affiliate Seven's "Sunday Night," the singer-songwriter said was treating the cancer with "modern" medicines and natural remedies after being told in 2017 she had cancer at the base of her spine.

"My husband's always there, and he's always there to support me, and I believe I will win over it and that's my goal," she told Seven.

Newton-John, who will turn 70 in a few weeks, was catapulted to fame when she starred opposite actor John Travolta in the high school musical "Grease."

Jeff Conaway, Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing walk arm in arm at a carnival in a still from the film, 'Grease.'

Since then she has released multiple number one hit singles as well as touring internationally. In 2017 she was touring the United States with her new album "Live On."

__label__world (CNN) For decades, mystery has swirled around what happened to the founding population of the remote Easter Island, known for its towering stone statues depicting large carved heads. A long-held theory suggests that after the islanders set up camp and carved the giant statues, they destroyed their own society through infighting and a depletion of natural resources.

But a new study suggests a different scenario entirely, and the islanders could have a more complex history than previously believed.

Many aspects of the island, the statues and the Polynesian seafarers who arrived there 900 years ago have been studied over the years. But a study published Monday in the Journal of Pacific Archaeology uses multiple data sets from recent excavations to provide a better understanding of the society that created the statues and how they were carved.

So the researchers used an unlikely method to study the society and discern what might have happened: a chemical analysis of stone tools used on the statues.

What they learned from excavating four of the statues and the volcanic stone basalt tools used to carve them painted a different picture: a sophisticated and collaborative society.

"The idea of competition and collapse on Easter Island might be overstated," said lead study author Dale Simpson Jr., an archaeologist at the University of Queensland, in a statement. "To me, the stone carving industry is solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups."

Moai are spread across the landscape of Easter Island.

A complex society

Easter Island is 2,300 miles off the coast of Chile. About 900 years ago, the founding population landed on the island, called Rapa Nui in the local language. These Polynesian seafarers came on two canoes and were led by Hotu Matu'a, who would become the island's first chief, according to oral tradition.

The population soared to include thousands of people, and they carved full-body figures, called moai, to represent important Rapa Nui ancestors. There are nearly a thousand statues, many buried up to their heads due to the passage of time. The largest statue is over 70 feet tall.

Their sheer size and number is indicative of a complex, sophisticated society, according to the researchers.

"Ancient Rapa Nui had chiefs, priests, and guilds of workers who fished, farmed, and made the moai. There was a certain level of sociopolitical organization that was needed to carve almost a thousand statues," Simpson said.

During the statue excavations, Jo Anne Van Tilburg, director of the Easter Island Statue Project, and her Rapa Nui excavation team recovered about 1,600 stone tools. They did a close chemical and mass spectrometer analysis of fragments from 17 of the tools, called toki.

"We wanted to figure out where the raw materials used to manufacture the artifacts came from," said Laure Dussubieux, a study co-author and Field Museum scientist, in a statement. "We wanted to know if people were taking material from close to where they lived."

The location is key because there are three sources, or quarries, where the islanders could have gathered material for tools. The basalt quarries cover the size of two football fields. Basalt samples reveal their sources through their chemical elements, which link back to the geology of the site.

"The majority of the toki came from one quarry complex -- once the people found the quarry they liked, they stayed with it," Simpson said. "For everyone to be using one type of stone, I believe they had to collaborate. That's why they were so successful -- they were working together."

Looking ahead

This contrasts with the idea that the residents ran out of resources and fought amongst themselves, the researchers said. But later on, it is believed that the arrival of colonists and the institution of slavery decimated the population.

"There's so much mystery around Easter Island, because it's so isolated, but on the island, people were, and still are, interacting in huge amounts," Simpson said. "There are thousands of Rapa Nui people alive today -- the society isn't gone."

But the researchers also urge caution and believe that this study is just the beginning, laying the groundwork for more research.

"The near exclusive use of one quarry to produce these seventeen tools supports a view of craft specialization based on information exchange, but we can't know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative," Van Tilburg said. "It may also have been coercive in some way. Human behavior is complex. This study encourages further mapping and stone sourcing, and our excavations continue to shed new light on moai carving."
__label__politics (CNN) The Trump administration plans to eliminate routine audits of lenders for violations of the Military Lending Act, according to internal agency documents, The New York Times reported on Friday.

Mick Mulvaney, the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, plans to terminate the supervisory examinations of lenders, arguing proactive oversight is not laid out in the legislation, according to the report.

The proposal to weaken oversight under the Military Lending Act, which was created to protect military service members and their families from financial fraud, predatory loans and credit card gouging, came as a surprise to advocates of military families, the report stated. Those advocates have pressed the government to put a stop to unethical lenders.

The agency has been critical in fighting lender misconduct, rolling out mortgage and payday-lender rules and cracking down on bad behavior by penalizing Citigroup Wells Fargo and many other lenders.

In lieu of conducting examinations, the agency will rely on complaints from its websites, hotlines, the military and people who believe they are victims of fraud, the Times reported.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign official, said she was placating Omarosa Manigault Newman when she indicated on tape that she believed President Donald Trump had been recorded saying the n-word.

"Your viewers, I'm pretty sure, have run into an individual that is the complete epitome of annoying to where you absolutely have to finally give in in order to get on about your day," Pierson said on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront."

"That happened a number of times because Omarosa is a bully."

Manigault Newman provided CBS News with audio from the 2016 campaign. In the audio played on CBS earlier Tuesday, Manigault Newman, Pierson and campaign aide Lynne Patton discussed the possible existence of a recording where Trump said the n-word, and Pierson can be heard saying, "No, he said it. He is embarrassed by it."

Pierson told CNN on Tuesday evening that Manigault Newman had brought up the possibility of the Trump n-word tape frequently, like "a dog with a bone," and that she placated Manigault Newman "a number of times because she would not let this tape go."

One person died and six people were believed to be missing as of Thursday, according to Kyaw Kyaw, an official who represents Yadeshe in Bago Division's regional parliament.

A breach of the Swar irrigation dam's spillway at 4 a.m. on Wednesday local time (6 p.m. Tuesday evening ET) sent water gushing into Swar, Yadeshe, and nearby villages.

Kyaw Kyaw added that some people had started to return home as the flood water had subsided and that local authorities were turning their attention to rehabilitation.

Residents negotiate a flooded road Wednesday after rampaging waters from the Swar Chaung dam spillway submerged villages in the Bago region of central Myanmar.

__label__politics (CNN) In the first episode of the newly relaunched sitcom Roseanne, we learn that Roseanne Conner, like the actress who plays her Roseanne Barr, is a Donald Trump supporter.

The news struck some longtime fans of the shows as odd. During the original run, Roseanne Conner snickered at the idea of lowering taxes for businesses and paying workers non-union wages. The show also won accolades for how it handled LGBT storylines and promoted feminism.

Barr herself attended Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration.

How could a show that was considered progressive during its time now have a main character that backs Trump?

It turns out, Conner supporting Trump in 2018 is one of the most realistic political evolutions on television.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A wide array of House and Senate Republicans are not yet ready to endorse President Donald Trump's bid for a second term, a reflection of the deep uncertainty on Capitol Hill over his political standing amid growing problems at home and abroad.

In interviews with a cross-section of more than two dozen GOP lawmakers, ranging from rank-and-file members, conservatives and party leaders, many refused to say they'd back Trump's re-election bid -- a surprise declaration given that members of Congress are typically quick to endorse sitting presidents of their own party without hesitation. Hardly any would offer a categorical endorsement of the President.

"I don't know what the world is going to look like," said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, when asked if he'd endorse Trump for re-election. "But let's say it's not something I've given any thought to."

Asked several days later if he had given thought to it, Cornyn demurred.

"I haven't even thought about that election," said Cornyn, No. 2 in the Senate GOP conference. "I'm worried about the midterm election."

He's not alone. Many lawmakers sought to avoid the topic altogether.

"Look, I'm focused on opioids," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, the veteran Republican from Tennessee, referring to efforts in Congress to deal with the drug epidemic. "And I was just reelected myself three years ago. So, I'm focused on that."

And others said they were still uncertain the President would ultimately stand for re-election -- even though the White House and Trump himself have repeatedly said he would do so, as he's hired a campaign manager, has been raising money and holding campaign rallies in anticipation of 2020. Unlike past presidents who have waited to announce their reelection bids, Trump made clear immediately after taking office that he's running again.

Still, many Republicans aren't certain he'll do it.

"That's a little loaded," said Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan when asked if he'd support Trump for re-election. "One: we need to make sure that he's actually moving forward and wants to go after this -- so when he makes a declaration, then I think that would be a time to determine whether there are others (who) run or not."

White House officials did not provide a comment for this story. Trump, however, may have little concern about whether his party in Washington is fully behind him. Few lawmakers backed his primary bid in 2016, and many abandoned him in the general election after the now-infamous "Access Hollywood" tape emerged showing him talking crudely about groping women.

Come 2020, things may be no different.

The conservative South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, when asked about backing Trump's re-election bid, said: "I'm worried about my own race right now."

And the moderate Adam Kinzinger of Illinois had a similar refrain.

"That's 2020 -- pretty far away," he said when asked if he'd back Trump for re-election.

GOP skeptical Trump would lose to primary challenge

Moreover, Trump could face a primary challenger in 2020, though many Republicans on the Hill don't think it's possible that any viable challenger will emerge. Arizona Sen Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic who is retiring at year's end, won't rule out a potential primary challenge against the President. And he contended that Trump's staunch support within the party could weaken by the 2020 primary season.

"I wouldn't gauge what support there is a year-and-a-half from now from what support there is now," Flake told CNN. "Certainly, now, this is Donald Trump's party. The base is with him in a big way. Believe me, we all know. But that's not to say that will hold."

It's highly unusual for sitting presidents to face primaries --- much less serious contenders. In 1992, George H.W. Bush fended off a challenge from Pat Buchanan, who ran a populist campaign against the sitting GOP president but didn't win a single primary. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter faced a fierce primary from then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, who eventually conceded after a bitter fight. And in 1976, Ronald Reagan tried to pull off an upset against President Gerald Ford but fell short at the GOP convention. All three sitting presidents lost their reelection bids.

This time around, few Republicans think that potential challengers -- like Flake or Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- would have a chance to win.

If Kasich runs, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman appears likely to side with Trump, whom he said is "very popular in Ohio among Republicans."

Portman said he plans to endorse "our standard-bearer, and I assume that will be Mr. Trump."

But asked if there's a possibility he wouldn't back Trump, Portman added: "I mean I would assume that he'll run for re-election but I don't know. Some would say that he's going to get his work done and move back to the private sector, so who knows, who knows? It's just speculative at this point."

Awaiting the midterms

What puts Republicans on Capitol Hill in an awkward spot is the fact that Trump's approval numbers remain rock-solid among core GOP voters, standing at 85% among Republicans in a recent Quinnipiac poll. But if they side too closely with Trump, they risk alienating the broader electorate, where his poll numbers have been historically low.

It's his shaky standing that could prompt a Democratic wave in this fall's elections, with the GOP at serious risk of losing the House and potentially even the Senate. If that were to happen, some believe, Republicans in the Washington will begin to search for a new GOP candidate come 2020.

"Wait until the midterms," said the outgoing GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate from Pennsylvania. "If we get wiped out, the question is going to be: 'Should we do that again?'" referring to backing Trump for re-election.

And even some loyal Trump supporters are cautious about 2020, waiting for the midterms to play out first.

"I've supported the President in the past and support him now but three years from now?" said Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a freshman Republican. "I think the midterms are a long ways away in terms of politics; I don't get involved that far ahead."

Sen. John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, asked if he would support Trump in 2020, said: "Well that's a long ways off. I want to get through 2018 first."

But Thune, who called on Trump to drop out in 2016 after the "Access Hollywood" tape emerged , added a note of optimism for Trump, saying that he expects "most of us would probably be behind him" if "he continues to get things done for the American people."

Others wouldn't go that far, including Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from the pivotal swing state of Florida, who said "it's premature" to say if he'll endorse Trump's re-election bid.

"I'm focused on working and doing what I do and so to talk about what might happen in that time I think is premature," Diaz-Balart said. "We have one President, he's President until the next election, and I will continue to work with him like I work with everybody else to get things done."

Yet despite Trump's public refrain that the party is more united than ever, he has yet to win over some Republicans who didn't back him in 2016. And some have no plans to back him now -- at least not yet.

"I did not endorse the President for the Republican nomination in 2016," said the moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. "I supported first Jeb Bush and then John Kasich. So, again, I think it is far too early to make a judgment of that type."

At least five people were killed Tuesday in clashes and 68 others injured, including 41 civilians and 27 military personnel, health ministry spokesman Dr. Saif Al-Badr told CNN. One protester died Monday in clashes with Iraqi authorities.

Anger has swelled in Basra, an oil-rich city that's 280 miles south of Baghdad, throughout the hot summer months over a lack of basic services and high unemployment. Other points of frustration among protesters are prolonged power cuts, contaminated water that has sent hundreds to the hospital and sanitation problems.

Protesters on Wednesday focused their dissatisfaction over poor government services on the Basra governorate building. Scores of people assembled there, a video posted to Facebook shows. After being sprayed with tear gas, demonstrators "threw Molotov cocktails at the building," activist Kadhtem Sahlani told CNN.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) An informal council is exerting sweeping influence over the US Department of Veterans Affairs from President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, a former VA official confirmed to CNN, corroborating details first reported Tuesday by ProPublica .

This group of three, led by Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter, was very open about the fact that they had been "anointed by the President and had his full support to influence policy at the VA" despite never being appointed or installed as formal advisers, the source said.

Bruce Moskowitz, a Palm Beach doctor, and lawyer Marc Sherman were the other two individuals who worked to influence the VA from the outside, the source confirmed.

The trio, known within the VA as "the Mar-a-Lago crowd," have used their influence with Trump and within the VA for personal gain, badgering career staff, pushing certain policies and products and ignoring government rules and processes, ProPublica said.

It cited hundreds of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act in the article, which says the three exercised their influence without "transparency, accountability or oversight," and that officials traveled to Mar-a-Lago at taxpayer expense to hear their views.

CNN has not been able to independently gain access to the documents or confirm their contents.

ProPublica is an independent, nonprofit newsroom focused on investigative journalism.

Its investigation found that Perlmutter, Moskowitz and Sherman pushed for expanded use of private-sector health options at the VA, proposing to invite "private health care executives to tell the VA which services they should outsource to private providers like themselves ... precisely the kind of fox-in-the-henhouse scenario that the VA's defenders had warned against for years."

The former VA official corroborated that account, saying there was tension over the issue at the VA, with former Secretary David Shulkin accusing Trump allies of wanting to privatize the VA's health services. The three men told ProPublica they never sought or received financial gain for their work with the VA.

'Most productive'

VA spokesperson Curt Cashour, responding to a CNN request for comment, did not specifically address details related to the "Mar-a-Lago crowd" but said the department appreciates "hearing from experts both inside and outside VA as we look for better ways to serve our nation's heroes."

"This broad range of input from individuals both inside and outside VA has helped us immensely over the last year and a half -- a period that hands down has been VA's most productive in decades," the statement said.

CNN reached out to all three men. They have not yet responded to requests for comment.

According to ProPublica, Perlmutter, Moskowitz and Sherman declined to be interviewed and fielded questions through a crisis communications consultant who offered a statement downplaying their influence.

"At all times, we offered our help and advice on a voluntary basis, seeking nothing at all in return," the statement provided to ProPublica said. "While we were always willing to share our thoughts, we did not make or implement any type of policy, possess any authority over agency decisions, or direct government officials to take any actions. ... To the extent anyone thought our role was anything other than that, we don't believe it was the result of anything we said or did."

'A huge corruption scandal'

But Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer reacted to ProPublica's report on Twitter, calling the revelation "a huge corruption scandal."

"Trump gave power to make decisions at the VA - affecting every US veteran - to three men who are neither government officials nor vets. Their only qualification: membership at Mar-A-Lago, for which they pay Trump," Beyer said.

Membership to the exclusive 20-acre club in Palm Beach, Florida -- now dubbed by Trump the "Winter White House" -- reportedly costs $200,000, with annual dues of $14,000.

The ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs wrote to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie on Wednesday, demanding any and all communications between VA officials and Perlmutter, Moskowitz and Sherman.

"The situation reeks of corruption and cronyism," said Rep. Tim Walz of Minnesota in a statement.

The trio's influence at the agency caused "frustration and confusion ... for career government employees having to work outside the bounds of what we know is right," the source told CNN. "We tried on the government side to keep things appropriate, but senior VA officials were applying pressure to meet these outside demands."

The former VA official noted that in the summer of 2017 some in the organization had been reprimanded for openly discussing Perlmutter's involvement. Shulkin was among those who told staff to keep quiet about the fact that the Marvel magnate was so closely involved in the agency under the "auspices of protecting his privacy."

ProPublica noted that the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 gives agencies a way to consult outside advisers, but those panels and committees have to comply with cost controls, public disclosure and government oversight.

Barking at VA officials

According to ProPublica, Perlmutter would "bark" at VA officials during phone calls, imploring them to move faster. Former officials told ProPublica that the Marvel chairman would say he had no patience for bureaucratic explanations about why things had to be done a certain way or took a certain amount of time.

The source told CNN that Perlmutter was very keen on getting the inside scoop on what changes needed to happen inside the VA and made it clear that he had a direct line to the President and his son-in-law and senior aide, Jared Kushner.

The "sense of entitlement from Mar-a-Lago was handed down directly from the President -- Ike was very candid he could go directly to the White House or directly to Jared," the source said.

Perlmutter's conversations were specific about how he could help the private sector get more involved in VA operations and how he could use his relationships to get people to the table.

"I've never met anyone in this town that didn't say they had a genuine interest in helping vets," the source said, adding that beyond that surface level interest, there was no way to know what the true intentions of the Mar-a-Lago crowd were.

A representatives from Marvel and representatives from several veterans groups attend an event at the NYSE on November 7, 2017.

The group used its influence at the VA for personal gain, ProPublica reported, detailing a 2017 Veteran's Day event at the New York Stock Exchange that Perlmutter proposed during a series of conference calls with executives at Johnson & Johnson.

The event was pitched as a way to promote a public awareness campaign about veteran suicide -- but ultimately also turned into a promotional opportunity for Perlmutter's company with executives from Marvel, its parent company Disney and Johnson & Johnson acting as sponsors.

A former VA official told CNN that this event -- which included Shulkin ringing the opening bell -- was coordinated primarily by the VA's Executive-in-Charge for the Office of Information and Technology Camilo Sandoval, who worked directly with Marvel executives on planning the event.

Sandoval, the former director of data operations for Trump's 2016 campaign, came to the VA after working at the Treasury Department and reportedly clashing with staff there.

Marvel 'swag'

Congressional Democrats called on then-Deputy Secretary Thomas Bowman to fire Sandoval, saying his appointment raised data security concerns due to his previous position as the Trump campaign's data operations director.

Ultimately, Marvel superheroes Captain America and Spider Man joined Shulkin at the NY Stock Exchange for the event and Marvel "swag" was distributed to those present, according to ProPublica and images of the event obtained by CNN.

Shulkin was recommended to Trump by Perlmutter, but the then-VA secretary quickly became frustrated by demands from the Marvel chairman and his informal Mar-a-Lago council, ProPublica reported. Shulkin was ousted in March.

The former VA official told CNN that it was almost as if the Mar-a-Lago group were given influence over the agency as "spoils" after Trump's election victory, adding that the dynamic was "unprecedented."

__label__world (CNN) Russia will stage its largest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union next month, the country's Defense Ministry said Monday.

Thousands of troops from China and Mongolia are expected to join in the exercises in Siberia, dubbed Vostok 2018, according to statements from the Russian and Chinese defense ministries.

The games will have an "unprecedented scale both in territory and number of troops involved," supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian armed forces, Gen. Sergi Shoigu, said in a statement.

Shoigu said it would be the "largest event since the Zapad-81 maneuvers," which involved as many as 150,000 troops, according to CIA documents.

Those exercises saw the Soviet Union test new weapons, including intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Videos from the Zapad-81 games show huge formations of tanks and artillery as well as jet aircraft making mock attacks.
__label__politics (CNN) In a significant political shift, several top Democrats considered to be possible contenders in the 2020 presidential race are backing legislation that would decriminalize marijuana.

The shift has left Democratic operatives and marijuana legalization activists across the country saying it's difficult to imagine a debate stage in the 2020 primary race where almost all of the presidential hopefuls don't publicly back removing marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act.

The latest signal came when Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic candidate who is widely considered a top contender for the nomination in 2020, signed onto The Marijuana Justice Act on Thursday. The bill, proposed by Sen. Cory Booker, himself a 2020 contender, would effectively end the federal crackdown on marijuana by removing the drug from the Controlled Substances Act. It was also backed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another possible 2020 hopeful.

Democratic endorsement of legalization would also be a departure from the party's 2016 position. Hillary Clinton, the party's nominee in 2016, said the federal government should allow states to legalize marijuana and called for removing the drug from the schedule 1 list, but did not go so far as to call for its removal from the Controlled Substances Act.

While Democratic operatives reject the idea that the issue will be a litmus test in the presidential contest -- the party, says a Democratic National Committee official, doesn't have litmus tests -- Democratic shifts on the issue have put pressure on every candidate to either catch up to the electorate or risk falling behind.

The shift comes amid recent movement by the Trump administration on the issue. President Donald Trump recently agreed to support protecting states that have legalized marijuana, after being pressured by Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican. The deal comes after Attorney General Jeff Sessions signaled a desire earlier this year to go after states that have legalized marijuana by rescinding guidance from the Obama administration that had laid out a policy of non-interference.

In another step toward legalization, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer threw his weight behind loosening marijuana laws on Thursday, telling Vice News that he will be introducing legislation to decriminalize the drug soon.

"The legislation is long overdue based on, you know, a bunch of different facts," Schumer said. "Ultimately, it is the right thing to do. Freedom. If smoking marijuana doesn't hurt anybody else, why shouldn't we allow people to do it and not make it criminal."

A watershed moment

Activists who have long hoped the issue would become a key plank in a Democratic nomination fight are hopeful Thursday's news signals a watershed moment is on the horizon.

"Descheduling marijuana should and will likely be a litmus test in the 2020 Democratic primary," said Erik Altieri, the executive director of The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. "As we have seen, leaders from the party are seeing that leading the charge on this is not just good policy but is good politics."

Removing marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act -- where it is now in line with heroin, LSD and ecstasy -- would be a boon for states that have backed legalization. It would allow dispensaries and growers to utilize banks like they haven't been able to before and remove the threat of a federal crackdown, something growers and sellers are particularly worried about under Trump.

Sanders, Booker and Gillibrand are not the only possible candidates backing legalized marijuana, either.

Both Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, two other potential candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination, have defended the successful efforts to legalize marijuana in their respective states. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said earlier this year that she is planning to introduce legislation that protects states that have legalized marijuana from a possible crackdown. And Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who has already started to make trips out to early presidential primary and caucus states, helped implement the plan to legalize marijuana in California, making his city that largest in the United States selling legal pot.

The political shift from Democratic leaders has tracked with polling, too. According to a Pew Research Center poll released earlier this year, 61% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal, more than double the 31% who supported legalization in 2000. The support from Democrats (69%) is even more overwhelming.

Skyler McKinley, the founding deputy director of Hickenlooper's Office of Marijuana Coordination, said that while the Democratic shift is good policy, it is also good politics.

"Especially on the Democratic side," McKinley said, "I don't think anyone who wants to continue the drug war on marijuana is going to be the nominee."

He added: "Imagine the debates. If a moderator just asks, 'Do you support descheduling marijuana' and a candidate says no, that's a viral ad right there."

This level of support is not a surprise to most top Democratic operatives. According to a former Clinton campaign staffer, the issue tested markedly well in focus groups with independent-leaning voters.

In one such group, the former staffer said, one woman brought up the case for legalizing marijuana, making the argument that it would create jobs and boost the economy.

"The group almost all agreed very enthusiastically," the staffer said, adding that the idea "caught on like wildfire."

One outlier in the 2020 field may be former Vice President Joe Biden, who said in 2014 that the Obama administration backed better enforcement efforts, not outright legalization.

"I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources," Biden told TIME. "That's different than [legalization]. Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization, and that is [and] continues to be our policy."

A spokesman for Biden declined to comment.

The Democratic evolution

Democratic views on marijuana have evolved significantly over the past three decades.

In 1992, Bill Clinton, then running for president, admitted that he "experimented with marijuana a time or two" when he was a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford.

"I didn't like it," he said. "I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again."

Fast forward 11 years to 2003, where all candidates at a Democratic presidential debate in Boston were asked whether they had ever used marijuana.

In a sign that the politics around the issue had changed, three of the candidates said they had and Sen. Joe Lieberman apologized for never trying the drug.

"I have a reputation for giving unpopular answers at Democratic debates," he said. "I never used marijuana. Sorry!"

President Barack Obama opposed decriminalizing marijuana during the 2008 campaign but, much like the rest of the Democratic Party, evolved on the issue in his eight years as president and, in his exit interview with Rolling Stone, said the drug should be treated similar to tobacco or alcohol and raised questions about the "untenable" situation of having states with such varied laws.

The largest sea change came during Obama's presidency, though, when Colorado votes made the state the first to legalize marijuana in 2012. Although Hickenlooper, the state's governor, initially opposed the measure, he agreed to implement the publicly backed measure and, eventually, began to support legalization with federal officials.

"Hickenlooper was our opponent in Colorado," said Mason Tvert, a partner at VS Strategies who co-directed the Amendment 64 campaign in the state. "But, after it passed, he did take action to ensure it was implemented and since then he has been evolving on the issue and he has acknowledged that it hasn't caused the problems that he thought it could."

During the 2016 campaign, both candidates were pushed on the issue. Sen. Bernie Sanders said at a CNN debate in Nevada that he would back a state plan to legalize recreational marijuana after calling for an end to the federal ban in 2015. Clinton said the federal government should allow states to legalize marijuana and called for removing the drug from the schedule 1 list. She did not say whether she backed removing the marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act altogether.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Brett Kavanaugh spent much of 12 hours in a packed and raucous Senate hearing room Wednesday trying not to talk about politics -- or how he would act in cases involving the man who nominated him to the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump.

Should the Senate confirm Kavanaugh, it would likely ensure a conservative majority for a generation and bolster Trump's legacy in reshaping the judiciary. But special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and other legal controversies surrounding the White House mean a Trump-specific case could hit the Supreme Court sooner rather than later.

"No one is above the law in our constitutional system," Kavanaugh said, adding that the presidency is not a monarchy.

But he refused to be drawn by Democrats into treacherous political areas. He declined to say if a sitting president must respond to a subpoena, and would not budge when asked whether a president could pardon himself.

"The question of self pardons is something I have never analyzed, it is a question I have not written about, it's a question therefore that is a hypothetical question that I cannot begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to Supreme Court," Kavanaugh said.

Trump earlier this year claimed he had an "absolute" right to pardon himself should he choose to.

Senate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny.

When asked whether a sitting President should be forced to respond to a subpoena, Kavanaugh said, "My understanding is that you're asking me to give my view on a potential hypothetical, and that is something that each of the eight justices currently sitting on the Supreme Court, when they were sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential hypothetical cases."

On whether he would recuse himself if an issue involving the President's criminal or civil liability came before the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh said: "I should not and may not make a commitment."

Kavanaugh also avoided a chance to discuss "political controversy" when GOP Sen. Jeff Flake asked about Trump's recent tweet on the Justice Department prosecuting two Republican congressmen -- both early Trump allies.

"I don't think we want judges commenting on the latest political controversy, because that would ultimately lead the people to doubt whether we're independent or whether we're politicians in robes, and so maintaining that strict independence of the judiciary requires me, I think, to avoid commenting on any current events," Kavanaugh said.

He repeated that sentiment just before 10 p.m. Wednesday night, when Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris asked about Trump's claim that "both sides" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville last year.

"I am not here to assess comments made in the political arena, because the risk is I'll be drawn into the political arena," Kavanaugh said.

Abortion and gun control

Over and over Wednesday, Kavanaugh, who was calm and disciplined during a long day of scrutiny from Democrats under pressure from grassroots activists to show vigorous resistance to Trump's nominee, argued that judges must be independent and must confine their rulings to precedent.

On abortion, Kavanaugh said that he viewed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision upholding a woman's right to an abortion as settled precedent of the Supreme Court under the doctrine of stare decisis.

Roe v. Wade is "entitled to respect" he said, adding that he understands the passion around the decision.

"I don't live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world. I understand the importance of the issue," he said.

But Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein raised doubts that a nominee's position would hold when it comes to ruling on abortion from the bench.

"When the subject comes up, the person says we will follow stare decisis, and then they get confirmed and they don't," she said of previous nominees.

Feinstein also chose to drill down on gun control and school shootings, asking Kavanaugh to explain his dissent in a 2011 DC Circuit case upholding the District of Columbia's ban on the possession of most semi-automatic rifles.

Kavanaugh argued that his reasoning was based on the Supreme Court's majority decision in the Heller case, a 2008 ruling authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, that held that semi-automatic rifles were constitutionally protected.

While decrying gun violence and sympathizing with Feinstein's horror over school shootings, Kavanaugh said, "I understand the issue, but as a judge, my job was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agree with it or disagree with it."

Wednesday's testimony was frequently interrupted by protestors who were led screaming out of the hearing room. But the proceedings lacked the bitterness and partisan sniping that characterized the opening day of the hearing on Tuesday.

Democrats are under pressure to show their voters that they have the backbone to challenge the administration and also want to make clear to their voters the huge stakes of getting out to vote -- since the GOP victory in 2016 gave Trump the chance to significantly tug the Supreme Court to the right, possibly for decades.

The President himself said that he was pleased with Kavanaugh's performance so far, saying he was "born for the position."

"I watched today for a little while. I saw some incredible answers to some very complex questions," Trump told reporters.

Has support from Manchin, GOP senators

In order to stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed, Democrats must keep their entire coalition together in the Senate and hope to pick off two Republicans, with the most likely options being Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins of Maine.

But there is also the chance that some Democrats, facing tough re-election races in states that Trump won handsomely in 2016, will be forced by their own hopes of political survival to vote for Kavanaugh.

One potential Democratic defector, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, told CNN that he has so far seen nothing disqualifying in the nominee's testimony.

"He's handled himself very professionally. ... His dialogue is more specific in his approach to being a jurist," Manchin said, adding that he felt the behavior of Republican and Democratic senators in the hearing had been deplorable. "That's what makes people sick," he said.

Republicans, meanwhile, remain confident. Kavanaugh has not only testified twice before, he worked on judicial nominations while serving in the George W. Bush White House. He understands the process better than most. He's been participating in "murder boards" -- practice sessions -- with clerks and Justice Department lawyers taking on the roles of senators, according to a participant.

The hearing will resume at 9:30 a.m. Thursday with another round of questions from senators.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Omarosa Manigault Newman has released a new audio recording in which she and Lara Trump, the wife of President Donald Trump's son Eric, are discussing a job offer with Trump's re-election campaign that the former White House aide alleged was a hush agreement.

Manigault Newman writes in her book , "Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House," that she turned down an offer from President Trump's daughter-in-law to sign a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for a job on the President's re-election campaign paying $15,000 per month. Manigault Newman said she was offered the deal after she was ousted from the White House last December.

Promoting her book this past week, Manigault Newman has released secret recordings she made of her conversations with the President and his aides, including a recording made in the White House Situation Room, raising national security questions.

In the newest audio recording released Thursday to MSNBC, Lara Trump, a senior adviser for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, can be heard telling Manigault Newman "that there are some things you've got in the back pocket to pull out." Trump appears to reference a New York Times article published shortly after Manigault Newman left the White House that gave the impression that the former aide was open to discussing her time in the administration.

"Clearly, if you come on board the campaign, like, we can't have -- we got to -- everything, everybody positive, right?" Trump adds in the conversation with Manigault Newman.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Rep. Tony Cardenas may hold on to his leadership positions despite facing allegations that he sexually assaulted a then-16-year-old girl in 2007 , causing some consternation within the ranks.

The California Democrat has a leadership position under House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi created after the 2016 elections, as well as a lower-level position on the whip team under Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland.

But perhaps most significantly: He chairs the political action committee of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus known as the Bold PAC, which donates money to Democratic candidates. The leadership of the PAC plans to meet Thursday, and Cardenas' chairmanship could be discussed, but the PAC will continue to raise money at a Washington event on Wednesday, according to a source briefed on the matter.

In a private meeting on Monday, Cardenas made his case to members of the Hispanic caucus, denying the allegations of sexual misconduct and suggesting he was a victim of a political vendetta, according to people who were present. He urged his colleagues to stick behind him.

Members in that meeting decided they would refer any media inquiries about Cardenas to the same statement they issued in December, one day before then-Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota announced he would resign over allegations of misconduct from before he became senator.

"It is the position of the CHC that those responsible for sexual harassment or sexual assault must be held accountable," the statement read. "Every allegation of sexual harassment and misconduct is extremely disturbing and requires a thorough investigation. As elected officials, we must adhere to the strictest and highest standards, regardless of political party, elected office, or seniority."

A spokesman for the chairwoman of the CHC, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, did not comment on whether the congresswoman wants Cardenas out as the chairman of the PAC.

But some Democrats are concerned about the optics of having a member accused of a serious crime atop a PAC that will dole out money to members facing re-election in the fall.

"It looks very bad," one Democratic member groused.

Another member said that Cardenas could avoid being reprimanded because of internal Democratic politics, given that Pelosi or a successor will likely need the support of the CHC to become speaker next year if the Democrats retake the House -- and are wary of sparking a feud with a powerful bloc of votes.

In addition to his position at the PAC, Cardenas was elected in December 2016 to a newly created leadership role for members of Congress who have served five terms or fewer. He also serves as an assistant whip.

Pelosi has said that the matter needs to be fully investigated by the House Ethics Committee. But it remains an open question whether the panel can even investigate the allegations since they occurred in 2007, which exceeds the panel's time frame for probing most matters.

Still, a senior Democratic aide notes there are at least two prior instances in which the committee investigated conduct beyond the panel's time frame -- separate probes involving former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York and Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois.

The same aide adds that Pelosi does not have the authority to remove Cardenas from his leadership role, since he was elected to the position by the whole caucus. Cardenas would either have to voluntarily step down or be voted out by his colleagues.

On Tuesday, Hoyer gave no indication that he thinks Cardenas should resign from his whip role. Hoyer told reporters that he considers the allegations to be "very serious" and said they warrant investigation. He said Cardenas has approached him to say he's not guilty and is prepared to cooperate fully with any probe.

Asked if Cardenas should step down from his whip position, Hoyer argued Cardenas is on a team with multiple people and that his position is "not a leadership role." According to whip hierarchy, there are several members who rank above Cardenas.

"Look, my position is, we have a process in America where you're innocent until proven guilty," Hoyer said. "If he were in a leadership position ... where he's in a place of speaking for the party, then I would think that would be a different situation. He's not in such a role."

Some Democrats note that the allegations, though grave, differ from those allegations made against other Democratic members over the past year, and leaders are keenly aware of setting precedents. There are not accusations from multiple people, as in the case with Rep. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, who decided not to seek re-election but denied wrongdoing after two unnamed women accused him of sexual misconduct from before he was elected. There are also not accusers willing to go on the record, as was the case with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, who resigned last fall after multiple women came forward.

Despite the allegations, some Democrats are siding with Cardenas, giving him the benefit of the doubt.

"I think he's being framed," said Rep. Jim Costa, a Democrat from California. "He's been a very effective leader of Bold PAC. I've known Tony Cardenas since our days in the state Legislature. I just do not believe these allegations are true."

Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat from New York who's a member of the CHC, said Cardenas "has reached out to everybody" in the upper ranks of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

"He has pronounced that he is innocent and didn't do anything," Espaillat said. "He should have his day and due process. ... As of now, we're offering the ability to have due process."
__label__politics Rep. Gallego (D-AZ) said that he would "gladly work with the president when his ideas aren't stupid and detrimental to the United States," after Sarah Sanders said that if Gallego has an issue with the potential cost of Trump's border security plan, that he should help instead of complain.
__label__world (CNN) Venezuela issued a new currency Monday in an attempt to bolster its crumbling economy as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation could hit one million percent this year.

The move, part of a dramatic raft of measures aimed at halting runaway hyperinflation, comes as thousands of Venezuelans continue to flee across the border into neighboring countries amid food and medicine shortages, political turmoil and soaring crime rates.

In a tweet posted following the unveiling of Venezuela's new currency Monday, the country's president Nicolas Maduro hailed the recovery package as a "revolutionary formula."

The new "Bolivar Soberano" currency is worth 100,000 "old" Bolivares.

"We found the revolutionary formula that puts work in the center of the general re-adjustment of society, based on the production of goods and the value of salary. With that, we're gonna put to rest forever the perverse model that dollarized the prices in the country," tweeted Venezuela's 55-year-old leader.

"I call on the people to defend -- conscientiously -- the adjustment of the prices on street," Maduro later said in another tweet.

A bank holiday was declared Monday, with banks remaining closed as the new currency took effect.

The rebranded currency, which has five fewer zeroes than the country's previous currency and will be pegged to a cryptocurrency called the Petro, is intended to simplify transactions.

Speaking to CNN from Caracas, journalist Stefano Pozzebon, said the new currency represented a "significant change" for the millions of Venezuelans who will have to deal with the numerical conversions.

"I went to the pharmacy and saw that a can of coke, for example, cost 2,800,000 of the older Bolivar, the ones that were still in use until yesterday at 8 p.m. This morning, the staff of the pharmacy were busy labeling the products with the new prices, and the can of coke will cost 28 bolivars."

However, experts remain unconvinced. Writing in Forbes , economist Steve Hanke of the Cato institute likened the measures to cosmetic surgery, describing the new currency as a "scam."

"The bolivar's redenomination will be like going under the knife of one of Caracas's famed plastic surgeons. Appearances change, but, in reality, nothing changes. That's what's in store for the bolivar: a face lift."

Prominent opposition leader Henrique Capriles described the measures as a "final disaster."

The government is "gambling everything and experimenting in an irresponsible way, " wrote Capriles in an online essay , in which he accused Maduro of "starving his own people."

survey from February this year found that almost 90% of Venezuelans live in poverty and more than 60% surveyed said that they did not have enough money to buy food.

'Magic formula'

The new economic measures include a 60-fold increase in the minimum wage that will take effect September 1.

In an address Friday, Maduro said the government will provide assistance on the minimum wage increase for 90 days but employers are nervous they won't have enough money to pay their staff.

Explaining the measures on national television Sunday night, Maduro said: "This is a really impressive, magic formula that we discovered while studying with our own, Venezuelan, Latin American-rooted thinking."

The latest announcements caused merchants to close their doors over the weekend, not knowing how to reflect the new currency in their pricing. Shoppers, on the other hand, rushed to supermarkets and gas stations that remained open.

In a Facebook Live address Sunday, Maduro described the measures as part of a "re-balancing process."

"This does not happen overnight," he said. "This re-balancing process will be developed. This is a magic formula that is truly impressive. That we discovered through our own thoughts and analysis."

Amid the chaos, there have been attempts on Maduro's life. Two high-ranking military officers were detained earlier this month in connection with an alleged drone attack against Maduro. The government said drones armed with explosives flew toward the president as he spoke at a military parade.

Maduro has accused opposition groups of orchestrating the August 4 failed attack and claimed the "financiers and planners" of the operation live in Florida.

Venezuelan citizens wait in line to cross to Ecuador at the Rumichaca international bridge in Ipiales, Colombia, on August 11, 2018.

Once land of opportunity

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) more than half a million Venezuelans have crossed into Ecuador via Colombia since the start of the year, with some 30,000 entering in the first week of August alone.

But the mass exodus is ratcheting up tensions in neighboring countries. On Sunday, Brazil announced it would deploy 120 men from the country's national force to the border state of Roraima, where hostility towards Venezuelan migrants has led to violence.

On Saturday, a mob of Brazilians attacked a group of Venezuelans in a border city and destroyed a migrant camp after a local business owner was robbed by Venezuelans, according to Brazil's state run news outlet, Agencia Brasil. Around 1,200 Venezuelan migrants fled back over the border after the attack.

A judge had earlier ruled to prohibit the entry of all Venezuelans to the state but the decision was overturned by Brazil's supreme court.

The Brazilian government has said it is committed to helping Venezuelans and will continue to try to spread migrants throughout various states in the country.

The Venezuelan government issued a statement asking the Brazilian government to "take measures to safeguard and secure" Venezuelan citizens, "their families and belongings."

Meanwhile, a new rule came into effect in Ecuador Saturday requiring Venezuelan citizens entering the country to present a valid passport. Previously, Ecuador accepted other forms of identification.

CNN was present at the border and spoke to some of the migrants. Many were caught by surprise, having started their journeys before the measure went into effect.

"My family is fragmented, destroyed. We're no longer together," one Venezuelan migrant told CNN Sunday. "My son is in Peru, my daughter in Chile, I have yet another daughter who's on her way to Poland. Give me a break! When will I get them all together again? My wife is in Venezuela. The situation is dire."

'Largest mass-population movements'

On Sunday as Ecuador's Interior Ministry relaxed the identification rule slightly, saying on Twitter that the law allows for children and adolescents to not present their passport "as long as both parents have it and show their relationship of filiation and kinship."

The Ecuadorian government has declared a state of emergency in human mobility in three provinces, meaning it can assign additional resources to Venezuelans.

Ecuador is both a destination and transit point for Venezuelans escaping the humanitarian crisis in their own country. Some of the migrants are also heading towards Peru and countries further south.

The Peruvian government has followed Ecuador's lead, announcing Saturday that beginning August 25, Venezuelan citizens who want to enter Peru can only do so with a valid passport.

It is a reversal of fortunes for Venezuela, which was once the richest country in Latin America and a destination of choice for those fleeing turmoil in the region during the 1970s and 80s.

Colombians fleeing civil war, Peruvians fleeing the political and economic instability under Alberto Fujimori and Chileans fleeing the Pinochet dictatorship sought refuge in the oil-rich country, which was seen as a land of opportunity.

Venezuelans filed 117,000 asylum claims in the first six months of this year, surpassing the total number of claims made in 2017, according to the UNHCR.

"The exodus of Venezuelans from the country is one of Latin America's largest mass-population movements in history," UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said in a statement. "Many of the Venezuelans are moving on foot, in an odyssey of days and even weeks in precarious conditions."
__label__politics (CNN) It was a jaw-dropping moment that embodied the utterly unfathomable, logic-defying and increasingly troubling twilight zone into which Washington has plunged since the Helsinki summit.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was onstage at a security forum in Aspen, Colorado, when he was told by NBC's Andrea Mitchell that the White House had announced on Twitter that President Donald Trump had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit in the fall.

"Say that again," Coats said, doing a double take and laughing in disbelief at the absurdity of the latest episode in the Russia saga. Once he had collected himself, he added: "Okaaaay. ... That's going to be special."

It was a comic twist that exemplified the way Trump has tipped American foreign policy and presidential convention on its head since his controversial summit with Putin on Monday, in which he was deeply deferential to the Russian leader and lashed out at his own country.

The barely believable events of recent days are provoking rising debate in Washington and in the media over whether Russia does indeed have some incriminating intelligence it is holding over the President's head that is influencing his behavior toward Putin. There has so far been no publicly available evidence to support that case.

But Steve Hall, a former CIA station chief in Moscow, issued a chilling warning on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Thursday -- which if it is borne out would have unfathomable political consequences.

"Before the Helsinki summit, I was not prepared to go to the darkest corner in the room and say there is kompromat -- there is compromising information -- on Donald Trump," Hall said.

"After ... I saw Donald Trump treat (Putin) in a fashion that is just inexplicable, the only conclusion that I can come to is ... I think there is information and data out there that implies there is indeed compromising information that Vladimir Putin has on Donald Trump. Why else would he treat him that way?"

In Aspen, Coats' good humor masked the troubling implications of the fact that the nation's top intelligence chief found out from a reporter, on live television, that the Russian President had been invited to visit Washington, amid the uproar over what happened in Helsinki.

First of all, it was humiliating for Coats, just days after Trump preferred Putin's "very strong and powerful" denials of election interference over the assessment of Russia's culpability that had been delivered to him by the DNI before he went to Finland.

At best, it was an example of rank incompetence by the White House -- since the failure to give Coats prior notice of the announcement was deeply embarrassing to a senior intelligence official ostensibly speaking on behalf of the government.

But such is Trump's contempt for US intelligence agencies and their conclusions on Russian election interference that it could not be ruled out Coats was deliberately hung out to dry, after he reiterated warnings that Russia is still interfering in US democracy.

Trump doubles down with Putin invitation

Coats' humiliation, however, was not the most troubling development on another stunning day of reverberations from the Helsinki summit, on which Trump moved on from haphazard cleanup efforts to a defiant counterattack that was embodied by the Putin invitation.

Coats also revealed that he still did not know what had gone on in the nearly two-hour-long meeting in Finland, when the two Presidents met alone with only interpreters present. The disclosure indicates that the contents of Trump's meeting are still a mystery at top levels of his own government -- which in turn suggests a lack of a normal policy process and sheds new suspicion on the mysterious hold the Russian leader exerts over the US President.

In effect, the appearance by Coats was a direct challenge to Trump -- the kind of show of independence and defiance that typically does not sit well with the President.

At the end of Coats' appearance in Aspen there were new questions about how long he could survive in his job -- or even if he was actively daring the President to fire him.

The prospect that Putin could visit Washington is staggering in itself -- but it is consistent with Trump's practice of doubling down in a fight and refusing to cede ground to his critics, in this case those who believe that Helsinki was a debacle.

A Putin visit will be controversial because it will bring a US adversary accused of masterminding a scheme to help put Trump into power to the United States at about the same time as midterm elections that US spy agencies say are already falling victim to Moscow's meddling.

US national security analyst and military historian Max Boot agreed with the premise that the failure to notify Coats of the invitation smacked of White House incompetence but also suggested that "something more sinister and nefarious" was going on.

"Donald Trump is now being investigated by the FBI for colluding with Vladimir Putin to affect the 2016 US election, and now, he is effectively colluding with Putin right now, meeting privately with Putin," Boot said on CNN's "Erin Burnett Out Front."

Boot bemoaned the probability that senior officials don't know what Trump agreed to in the private head-to-head in Helsinki -- even as Russia begins to dribble out details

"The top people in the US government who ought to know, including Director Coats, they don't know." he said. "Putin knows but Director Coats doesn't know -- that is wrong, especially given the highly suspect relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin."

The Coats drama overshadowed another head-spinning development following Helsinki, as the White House backtracked on its previous statement that it was considering an offer by Putin that Trump called "incredible" -- to send US officials to Moscow for questioning.

Putin suggested at the summit that in return for FBI agents traveling to Moscow to interview suspects accused of election interference, Washington should make the Obama-era ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, who Putin regards as an enemy, available to Russian investigators.

The White House reversed course only hours before the Senate, in a rare bipartisan show of resistance, voted 98-0 to pass a resolution condemning the idea.

Even when announcing the climbdown, the White House showed unusual deference to Putin.

Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the proposal was made "in sincerity by President Putin, but President Trump disagrees with it."

Why Trump is lashing out

The President himself on Thursday leaped out of his defensive crouch, accusing his critics of preferring war with Russia to his diplomatic outreach.

The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear........ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018

"The summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed," Trump tweeted.

There is every sign that the President thinks a Putin visit could help him -- given that a new CBS News poll Thursday found 68% of Republicans approve of the way he handled the summit.

Every time Trump sets himself up against his media critics on a major national issue, it has the effect of cementing his bond with grassroots voters he needs to show up in November. Many of those voters rally to his side when they perceive he is being attacked by the media -- a state of mind that the President's tweet about the "real enemy of the people" is designed to foment.

Former CIA Director Michael Hayden used an intelligence community analogy to suggest that Trump's move was intended to demonstrate his belief that the meeting in Finland went well and that he is driving the relationship:

"The cover story for the President (is) that he was strong, that he was effective, that it was a successful meeting. He may well be the only one in the national capital area who is saying that, but that is his story and he is sticking to it."

Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who is now a CNN national security commentator, warned that Trump was playing a dangerous game.

"If you hug Vladimir Putin, you are going to get a knife in the back," he told Anderson Cooper.

The problem is that, prior to June 27, almost no one outside of New York's 14th District knew who she was. And that, in the following month, very few people who fully embraced her have really done any sort of deep dive into what all she believes.

Which leads to moments like this one, which occurred during an interview with Margaret Hoover for PBS' "Firing Line" in which Ocasio-Cortez gets herself into trouble when she starts talking about the Middle East and referring to Israelis who have settled in the West Bank as occupiers of Palestine. Hoover follows up, smartly, and Ocasio-Cortez begins to talk about an increase in settlements that makes it more difficult for Palestinians to access "their housing." Sensing that she is making things worse not better, Ocasio-Cortez admits: "I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue."

This is not to pick on Ocasio-Cortez. She's far from the only politician to get herself in too deep when it comes to the massive complexities surrounding a way forward in the Middle East. And, to her credit, at least she admitted she didn't know exactly what she was talking about; some politicians would just keep talking and talking in hopes of drowning their lack of knowledge in a sea of words.

__label__politics NEW YORK (CNN) Some nonprofit groups will no longer have to give the IRS the names of donors who give them $5,000 or more.

Among the groups that will no longer have to report donors are the National Rifle Association, various chambers of commerce, and groups focused on particular issues, such as Americans for Prosperity, which has been closely associated with the Koch brothers. But the ruling also applies to groups like the NAACP, labor unions and volunteer fire departments.

It was a long-sought goal of some of those groups -- particularly on the right.

The Treasury Department, which announced the rule change late Monday, said that information was never subject to public disclosure. Although the tax returns of nonprofit groups are public record, the information on donors' names had to be redacted before their release.

Senior Treasury officials said that donor lists have inadvertently been released in the past, and groups on both the left and the right had worried that people would be reluctant to make donations if they were worried their names would become public.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Newly obtained audio reveals the anguish of parents separated from their children, as it pours from them in immigration court while a judge finds them ineligible to stay in the United States.

In recordings of two court proceedings obtained by CNN, two women who have been separated from their children plead with an immigration judge to reunite them, as he asks them if they have any evidence to back up their asylum claims.

Their attorneys also ask the judge to give them another chance to make their cases, citing their mental health after the prolonged separation from their children.

In both cases, however, the judge denies the requests, and orders the women deported from the country. Both women were told they could speak with their deportation officer about being reunited with their children. CNN has received permission from the women to share the audio of their hearings, but is not identifying them for their protection.

While the hearings are just two of thousands of similar proceedings regularly held across the country, they are an indication of the struggles of parents who have been separated from their children for weeks or longer in their quest to stay in the United States. Thousands of parents were separated from their children at the border under the Trump administration's now-reversed "zero tolerance" policy that prosecuted all adults caught crossing the border illegally, including parents with their children.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump has repeated like a mantra there was "no collusion!" between his campaign and Russians trying to meddle in the 2016 US election.

But in the shocking new 29-page indictment filed by the US Department of Justice against 12 Russian intelligence operatives for meddling in the 2016 election, there is one passage that brings to mind a moment when Trump publicly asked the Russians to do something -- and privately, they turned around and did exactly what he'd requested.

Full coverage: Russian agents indicted for election meddling

The indictment does not explicitly mention Trump asking for anything, but it does say this starting on page 7:

22. The Conspirators spearfished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearfish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton's personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.

How do we get from this passage to a direct plea from Trump? You don't have to go far. On July 27, 2016, Trump gave a news conference in Florida. At that news conference, he asked Russia to find Clinton emails.

Here's the video. Watch it.

JUST WATCHED Donald Trump directly addresses Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump directly addresses Russia 01:01

Or read this transcript of the moment after he was asked a question at that July 27 news conference about Vladimir Putin (whom he'll see at a summit Monday, by the way) and in the context of the hacking of the DNC:

TRUMP: Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our President. And if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next.

Now, in context, we should note that Trump did not specifically ask Russians to hack Clinton campaign officials, which is what they ended up doing. He was referring to emails from her time as secretary of state that were wiped from the private server where she kept them.

But he did say, "Russia, if you're listening," and then ask them to get Clinton emails. It was a shocking moment in a campaign chock full of them and now it has even more resonance.

It was "on or about" that same day, according to this indictment, that "the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearfish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton's personal office."

He asked for it and, "for the first time," they started spearfishing email accounts used by Clinton's office.

The news conference happened around 10:30 a.m. ET, which is around 5:30 p.m. in Moscow. "After hours."

Is it all a huge coincidence that the Russian agents picked that day to target Clinton email servers, as the US government alleges? It sure could be. Is it possible the Russians took this one cue directly from Trump's mouth? Sure seems like it.

__label__politics (CNN) In death, Senator John McCain has let loose an international outpouring of sympathy, respect and thinly veiled criticism of President Trump.

The tributes flooding in from world leaders seem to amplify McCain's principled stand against his President.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, who was criticized publicly by Trump last month, said that, "John McCain was a great statesman, who embodied the idea of service over self."

It is hard to read those words and not hear frustration and understand the subtle subtext.

Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Mass -- whose country is at loggerheads with Trump, in particular over NATO -- was less delicate: "John McCain was a convinced advocate of a strong and reliable transatlantic partnership, especially in difficult times. He believed in our shared values and principles."

Maas leaves little doubt whom he'd have rather seen in the White House.

The list goes on.

Europeans are clearly troubled by Trump's apparent willingness to give new friends like Vladimir Putin -- whom McCain strongly campaigned against -- preferential treatment over the US's traditional allies.

In those countries formerly under the Soviet Union's iron grip, tributes show a longing for the kind of constancy in US relations that McCain championed.

Slovakia's President Andrej Kiska lauded McCain as "a man of courage, of strong principles and tireless fighter for the values we share on both banks of the Atlantic."

Estonia's Prime Minister Juri Ratas said "he was a courageous and determined man, showing a remarkable understanding of global affairs. His contributions into the security of the Baltic states will never be forgotten."

Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite described McCain's passing as "a big loss not only to our region but also to the whole world."

And Latvia's President Raimonds Vejonis, completing the triumvirate of Baltic leaders who have been rattled by Trump's apparent ambivalence to their concerns about Russian aggression, added that McCain was "a true defender of democracy and freedom, and a great friend of Latvia."

Sen. McCain listens as former FBI Director James Comey testifies in front of the Senate Russia hearing.

Friend of many people

To imply McCain has garnered such glowing tributes simply to sound off frustration about Trump would be wrong though.

He was respected for who and what he was. He traveled the world as a tireless advocate for the United States, and made many friends along the way.

I remember meeting him in Afghanistan -- at that time one of the wildest and more dangerous places a US Senator could go -- he was relentless in finding out the facts for himself, whatever potential harm that may have put him in.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday paid him high praise: "Senator McCain served his country honorably in uniform and his service in the Senate is truly exemplary. We will remember his dedication and support towards rebuilding Afghanistan."

Where McCain had in the very real sense of the word been in harm's way -- a prisoner of war for five and half years in Vietnam, from 1967 to 1973 -- he was remembered by Vietnamese and Americans alike with flowers and tributes.

One American visiting the monument near Truc Bach Lake outside Hanoi, where McCain's bomber jet crashed 51 years ago, told Reuters news agency that McCain "was the last guy I ever voted for as President."

John McCain is examined by a Vietnamese doctor in 1967 after being captured in Hanoi.

Today's world leaders, who have no vote in US Presidential elections, seemed to give a nod towards a man they'd pick over the present incumbent.

They have done this not collectively in a carefully choreographed joint statement, but individually picking what's important for them and their countries in what amounts to a fusillade of criticism aimed at Trump.

Australia's new Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that "Senator John McCain was a true friend of Australia who was committed to strengthening the alliance between our two nations."

President Trump had a disastrous relationship with Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull, abruptly ending their first phone call days into office over a disagreement about refugees.

Of course, any of these tributes can be explained away for simply what they are -- well-intentioned condolence.

It is after all the skill of any accomplished politician to find phrases that appeal to all. What I hear may not be what everyone takes away.

However, it would feel to me naive not to grasp that, at the very least, what has been said in tribute to McCain -- either intentionally or unintentionally -- amounts to the broadest sounding so far of global disquiet among America's allies with Trump.

In that alone, Senator John McCain has been paid the highest accolade of all.

__label__politics (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday denied any prior knowledge of a mailing sent by state Democrats suggesting his primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, would not support Jewish communities in the face of anti-Semitism.

The New York State Democratic Committee, which is effectively controlled by the two-term governor, paid for the flier, which falsely claimed Nixon supports the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which aims to pressure Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, and accused her of being "silent on the rise of anti-Semitism."

Nixon, who condemned "the rising hate crimes we are seeing against Muslims, Jews and many other communities" as recently as late August, slammed the mailing in a statement on Sunday, calling it "an attack not only on my children and my character, but on all New Yorkers."

"The accusation that my family promotes anti-Semitism is deeply, deeply offensive," said Nixon, who is raising her two older children in the Jewish faith and attends a New York City synagogue.

She then turned her attention to Cuomo and the state party, accusing them of employing "Trump-style divide and conquer tactics."

__label__politics (CNN) A government watchdog group called for a congressional investigation Friday into allegations that acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler violated transparency law in his previous work as a lobbyist, accusing him of hiding meetings with the Department of Interior about shrinking a national monument to allow for the reopening of a uranium mine.

Campaign for Accountability's complaint alleges Wheeler and his prior lobbying firm, Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting, violated the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which aims to bring transparency to federal lobbying activity.

Wheeler worked for Faegre Baker Daniels prior to his confirmation as deputy administrator of the EPA in April. He took over as acting administrator in July after agency head Scott Pruitt resigned amid multiple scandals and investigations.

The EPA said in a statement to CNN, "Acting Administrator Wheeler has been very transparent concerning his work with Energy Fuels Resources, even discussing this during his confirmation process. He has consistently worked to comply with the Lobbying Disclosure Act; this particular matter involving Energy Fuels Resources and Bears Ears National Monument does not impact his work at EPA as this is not an agency-related issue."

As a lobbyist, Wheeler represented client Energy Fuels Resources Inc., a company that owns a now-dormant Daneros uranium mine in Utah, the group's complaint says. The mine was located within the original boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument before the Trump administration shrank those boundaries in December.

Without the shrunken borders, the mine could not be reopened.

The complaint says Wheeler lobbied for the shrinking of Bears Ears on behalf of Energy Fuels Resources, but Faegre Baker's disclosure forms in 2017 contained several omissions, including not listing a July 17 meeting that Wheeler attended with a company vice president and Interior officials, which would violate the lobbying law.

"In fact, however, during the third quarter of 2017 Mr. Wheeler and other Faegre Baker lobbyists were actively lobbying senior officials at the Department of the Interior in an effort to change the boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument in order to allow Energy Fuels to be able to reopen the Daneros uranium mine when uranium prices rise enough to make it commercially viable again," the complaint said.

The alleged inaccuracies raise the question of "whether Faegre Baker was extremely careless with its recordkeeping, or it whether it was deliberately trying to obscure Wheeler's lobbying activity," the Campaign for Accountability said in a statement to CNN. "If Andrew Wheeler and Faegre Baker failed to tell the truth about their work, they need to be held accountable."

The complaint alleges that Wheeler and his lobbying firm disclosed their interactions with members of Congress on the Bears Ears issue but did not record their interactions with senior Interior Department officials.

Faegre Baker told CNN it wouldn't comment on "anything related to client work."

CNN has reported that Energy Fuels also has tried to win contracts from the EPA to clean up abandoned uranium mines, according to the company's website and its CEO, raising questions among environmentalists about whether Wheeler can put his lobbying past behind him in leading the EPA.

Wheeler told CNN at the time that he "voluntarily stopped any advocacy activity with EPA under the anticipation that I might be considered for a position at the Agency. Under my ethics agreement with the Agency, I will have no involvement with EFI for two years."

However, the statement did not mean Wheeler was not lobbying other parts of the Trump administration following the election. And although he did not lobby the EPA while he was under consideration for a job at the agency, his lobbying firm's colleagues did.

CNN has reported that an internal EPA email showed that the same month Wheeler was lobbying the Interior Department to shrink Bears Ears, his lobbying colleagues at Faegre Baker Daniels were over at the EPA discussing abandoned uranium mines and their cleanup contracts.

(CNN) As scandal-weary as we are, we all need to take a deep breath to confront the gravity of the allegations that special counsel Robert Mueller brought on Friday against 12 members of the GRU, the Russian Military Intelligence organization.

The stunning accusation, in a meticulously detailed complaint lays it out: Members of an enemy army engaged in a coordinated criminal enterprise to secretly sabotage an American presidential election. The attacks were sustained, professional and largely successful. It would appear to be the most nefarious attack by a foreign government on the United States since Pearl Harbor.

Harry Litman

Worse, the attacks allegedly involved United States citizens, including a Trump campaign insider. Paragraph 44 of the indictment spells out that the defendants communicated with a "person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump."

It's a safe bet that the person did not report this patently illegal meddling to the FBI. That a person close to the campaign was allegedly involved raises the prospect of the unraveling of a conspiracy eclipsing Watergate in its brazenness and damage to national interests. Whoever it is, though, this person or persons may well be a concrete link between the Trump campaign and the saboteurs in the Russian government.

This revelation should finally put an end to the ignorant droning of the President and his defenders that the Mueller probe is a "witch hunt" that has failed to find any evidence of "collusion" with the Trump campaign.

__label__world (CNN) Rescue workers are using heavy equipment to dig through the debris from a landslide that buried houses and people in the small town of Atsuma on Japan's northern island prefecture of Hokkaido.

The landslide was triggered by a magnitude 6.7 earthquake that shook the island Thursday , killing at least 20 people, collapsing houses and cutting power to millions of homes.

It's the latest in a series of disasters that have hit the country, after multiple deaths caused by a severe typhoon , flooding, and heatwaves this summer. Experts say this could be the "new normal."

As many as 40,000 rescue workers, including 22,000 troops from Japan's Self Defense Forces, worked through the night in Atsuma Thursday to search for residents feared buried in the rubble.

Families of those missing stood around anxiously as the teams dug deep into the displaced earth.

One resident, Tenma Takimoto, 17, was waiting for his sister to be discovered -- she was finally found by rescue worker who had to dig with their bare hands. Takimoto, who also suffered a leg injury, told her, "You did great. You were patient enough."

Kenichi Endo, 70, had traveled to the small town to find his relative, Japanese news agency Jiji reported. "I never expected there would be a landslide by an earthquake," he said.

The first floor of missing man's two-story house, which he shared with his wife, was submerged in mud, the report said. Endo said he loved his relative, who is in his 80s, "like a brother."

Power that was cut to millions of houses started to return on Friday, and the nearby Shin Chitose Airport, closed due to the quake, had resumed partial operation.

All domestic flights, as well as a number of international flights, are expected to be back on schedule Saturday.

Buildings lie in ruins after being hit by a landslide caused by an earthquake, on September 7, 2018 in Atsuma.

'Back-to-back-to-back events'

Japan's summer of chaos has seen the country endure weeks of deadly floods, typhoons, earthquakes, landslides and heatwaves, in what disaster management experts say is a sign of what's to come.

Thursday's earthquake came just days after the strongest typhoon to hit Japan's mainland in 25 years smashed a tanker into a bridge, forcing one of the country's largest airports to close and hundreds of flights to be canceled. The storm caused at least 10 deaths.

A ship collided with a breakwater due to strong winds whipped by Typhoon Jebi in Nishinomiya city, Hyogo prefecture, September 5, 2018.

It's one of a succession of deadly natural disasters to have affected Japan since July. "Back-to-back-to-back events seem to have beaten a path for each other to follow," Senior Science Adviser Doug Bausch of the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) told CNN from Hawaii.

Two months ago, landslides and flooding caused by torrential rain across Japan -- from Saga in the far southwest to Gifu in the center of the main island of Honshu -- killed 200 people in what became one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the country since the earthquake and tsunami of 2011.

A car sits in water after the area was devastated by flooding and landslides in Mabi, Okayama prefecture on July 10, 2018.

The heavy rain that led to flash flooding was based on a longer-term pattern, said Munehiko Yamaguchi, from Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

Based on surface observations over 30 years, the number of torrential rain events in Japan is increasing, he said. Seismologist Robert Geller, professor emeritus of the University of Tokyo, said it's likely to get worse.

"We should stop saying 'extreme' and face up to the fact this is probably the new normal," he said.

He added that while earthquakes themselves are unlikely to be impacted by climatological change, heavy rain can exacerbate landslides -- as seen in Hokkaido -- and make conditions much worse.

Bausch, an impact modeler who tries to predict the effect of natural disasters, said what he has seen in the last couple of years have "impacts that dwarf anything seen previously."

'Taken by surprise'

The flooding was one of the more alarming events of Japan's summer.

"Japan is a well-prepared nation, to get caught off guard and to have a number of fatalities probably took them by surprise," Bausch said.

The floods came as swathes of the country sweltered under scorching summer temperatures.

In Kumagaya, a city near Tokyo, the mercury rose to 41.1 degrees (105.98F), the highest ever on record in Japan, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, almost 12 degrees hotter than average temperatures this time of year.

The effects of heat haze is seen during a heatwave in Tokyo on August 2, 2018.

Nearly 110 million of Japan's 128 million people were impacted by the heat wave, with roughly 90% of the country experiencing extreme heat, according to CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam.

It is a phenomenon played out on a much wider scale, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . This June was the fifth hottest June on record, the NOAA said, and all 10 warmest Junes have occurred since 2005, with the hottest ever in 2016.

Globally, the average land and ocean surface temperature for the first three months of the year was the sixth highest such period since global records began in 1880.

Fingers point to climate change

Disaster prevention experts say that while it is difficult to pin an exact cause on any one event, the trend of more frequent weather events points to climate change as the principal cause.

"If we go back far enough we can see things happening on these lines but globally we're definitely seeing more extreme events, because the oceans are warming; there's more moisture in the atmosphere," Bausch said.

He said, in addition to the increase in deadly events associated with hotter summers, winters are also becoming more extreme.

Japan has been somewhat shielded by the worst of the weather, due to its wealth and preparation.

"I think events like these would be catastrophic in countries like Myanmar, Bangladesh," Bausch said. "There have been, in recent history, tens of thousands of fatalities in events like these."

So what can be done?

Yamaguchi said that his agency was looking to change the warning systems' focus — from simply announcing the meteorological conditions to defining what the risks were -- for example warning of flood and landslides, rather than just warning of heavy rain.

"How to convey the (impact of this) meteorological information to the public is a challenge but we've made great progress," he said.

Disaster management agencies in Japan and abroad are learning each time there's a natural disaster.

"In 2011 the tsunami was bigger than expected, (there were) more fatalities and the evacuation areas and safe zones not big enough.

"(They) really under-designed for that. Everyone heeded that around the world, those lessons are learned both inside and outside Japan," Bausch said.

Observers took to Twitter to comment on the acronym's similarity to a curse word

(CNN) George Mason University recently renamed its law school after the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -- and then quickly realized the acronym that name created was problematic.

The school first announced it would change the name to The Antonin Scalia School of Law, or ASSoL, after receiving an anonymous $30 million donation on March 31.

Observers took to Twitter to comment on the acronym's similarity to a vulgarity, with many of those tweeting not a fan of the conservative justice.

The school's name change will go into effect July 1, pending final approval by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The FBI is in possession of a recording between President Donald Trump and his former personal attorney Michael Cohen in which the two men prior to the election discuss a payment to a former Playboy model who has alleged an affair with Trump, Rudy Giuliani and a source familiar with the matter told CNN Friday.

Cohen has other recordings of the President in his records that were seized by the FBI, said both a source with knowledge of Cohen's tapes and Giuliani, who described the other recordings as mundane discussions. Another source with knowledge of the tape, however, said the conversation is not as Giuliani described and is not good for the President, though the source would not elaborate.

The recording about the former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, was among the troves of documents and materials seized in the FBI raid of Cohen's hotel, residence and office earlier this year amid a criminal investigation of Cohen by the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. A transcript of the recording was reviewed by the Trump legal team, which does not believe it poses a legal problem for the President.

The President has waived privilege on the McDougal recording, said two sources briefed on legal discussions surrounding the materials seized in April.

The recording had been deemed privileged by a former federal judge, known as a special master, one of the sources said, adding that Trump's lawyers have sent a letter to the special master asking to withdraw the privilege. This gives the government access to the recording as part of the US attorney for the Southern District of New York investigation into Cohen.

The September 2016 recording is the only recording of any significance involving the President, another source said, despite there being hundreds of recordings.

The disclosure of the McDougal recording, which was first reported by The New York Times, raises fresh questions about the lengths to which Trump and his confidant would go to suppress allegations of extramarital affairs from becoming public before the election. Adult film actress Stormy Daniels has sued Trump over a $130,000 agreement Cohen made to her on Trump's behalf to keep her quiet about an alleged affair, which Trump has denied, along with McDougal's allegations.

McDougal eventually signed a contract with American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer, which barred her from publicly speaking about the alleged affair before the 2016 election.

On the recording, Cohen and Trump discuss buying the rights to that contract from AMI, according to Giuliani, who described the contract as a "nondisclosure agreement." The discussion, Giuliani said, involved their intention "to reimburse AMI for what they laid out and to do it by check, properly recorded."

The conversation was relatively quick, between approximately 90 seconds and two minutes, a source familiar with the tape said.

Giuliani added that "nothing in that conversation suggests it was a campaign contribution. There's no discussion about harm to the campaign" during the recorded conversation, which took place two months before the presidential election. The discussed payment to AMI ultimately never happened, according to Giuliani.

The source familiar with the tape said Cohen recommends buying the rights to the story and Trump asks questions about how they would go about doing that.

A source familiar with the AMI deal with McDougal disputed Giuliani's description of the deal. The source said it was not a nondisclosure agreement but a license agreement that clearly outlined the nature of its editorial aspects of the agreement.

Campaign-finance law experts say that if a payment is made for the purposes of influencing an election -- for example, to quiet allegations that could harm a candidate -- it can be considered a campaign contribution even if it isn't made from a campaign account. If such payments were made routinely and would have occurred regardless of the existence of any campaign, however, they may not be regarded as in service of an electoral effort.

Trump lashes out; other attorneys react

Giuliani said Trump had no idea he was being recorded during the McDougal discussion, which took place in the then-candidate's office at Trump Tower in September 2016. When informed about the recording, Trump said, "I can't believe Michael would do this to me," a source familiar with the tapes told CNN.

Trump lashed out at Cohen on Twitter Saturday morning, saying it was "inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of (and) perhaps illegal."

Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 21, 2018

A spokeswoman for the US attorney's office and Cohen declined to comment. Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, told CNN in a statement the recording will not hurt Cohen.

"Obviously, there is an ongoing investigation and we are sensitive to that," Davis said. "But, suffice it so say, that when the recording that has been widely reported is heard, it will not hurt Mr. Cohen. And any attempt to spin cannot change what is on the tape."

After Trump's tweet, Davis added Saturday in a post on Twitter: "The strategy of @realdonaldtrump @potus @RudyGiuliani is flawed; just as is #Trump's false #Twitter statement made against @michaelcohen212 this morning. Rudy claims the tape is "exculpatory". Why so angry?"

When asked about Davis' tweet, Giuliani told CNN: "How would you feel if your lawyer was recording you without telling you. The tweet is straightforward and correct."

McDougal's attorney Peter Stris tweeted on Friday: ".@karenmcdougal98→ When @realDonaldTrump said we were lying, do you think he meant we WEREN'T?" an apparent reference to Trump's claim of having misspoke at the summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week.

When asked by CNN if first lady Melania Trump had a comment on the news of the recorded conversation, her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement, "Mrs. Trump remains focused on her role as a mother and as First Lady of the United States. We will have no further comment on the topic."

Part of the criminal investigation of Cohen by the US attorney's office has examined possible election law violations related to payments made to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. One focus of the searches in April, CNN has reported, was to seek records on Cohen's payments to Daniels, who has alleged such an encounter, and on an agreement set up between McDougal and AMI, whose chairman and CEO is a close friend of Trump.

Cohen hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing.

There are other tapes of Cohen and other "powerful" individuals that the FBI seized beyond the President that could be embarrassing for the people on the tape and for Cohen, according to a source familiar with the tapes. The source said the people are of "significance and consequence."

The source familiar with the Cohen tapes said there was nothing illegal about the discussion, but acknowledged there could be ethical issues about Cohen recording his own client.

Giuilani has known about the tapes for several days, and has reviewed the transcripts, he told CNN.

In recent weeks, documents and other evidence obtained during April's searches has begun to be turned over to the government as the special master, Cohen's lawyers and lawyers representing Trump and the Trump Organization have moved through the process of determining which of the millions of items are subject to attorney-client privilege. The special master, Barbara Jones, however, so far has found the vast majority of the items reviewed to be not privileged, according to court filings, indicating that very little of what Cohen did in recent years qualified as legal work.

In recent weeks, Cohen's public remarks have raised suspicions that he could be willing to seek a cooperation agreement with the US attorney's office that would require him to provide information federal prosecutors could use against other individuals they are examining. It's not clear, however, whether the US attorney's office would be willing to grant Cohen such an deal.

In an interview with ABC News that was released earlier this month , Cohen said that protecting his family -- as opposed to Trump -- is his priority.

"My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will," Cohen said.

In August 2016, McDougal signed an agreement with AMI, Us Weekly, Men's Journal and several other publications. She believed at the time the contract was a work agreement that would allow her to be photographed for and write pieces that would run in the companies' publications.

Her attorney for that negotiation was Keith Davidson. She told CNN she later found out Davidson was in contact with Cohen. In a lawsuit, she accused Davidson of "working closely with representatives for Mr. Trump while pretending to advocate on her behalf." Davidson denied the allegations and told CNN that he reached out to Cohen during the final stretch of the 2016 campaign as a "professional courtesy" to let him know that he negotiated the deal with AMI.

McDougal later realized she could face a financial penalty for speaking to the media about her story. In April, she reached a settlement with AMI that allows her to discuss the alleged affair.

Speaking with CNN's Anderson Cooper in March, McDougal alleged that she and Trump were together "many dozens of times" and answered in the affirmative when asked if they were intimate.

McDougal described the alleged affair from 2006 to 2007 as a consensual, loving relationship, and said she did not know Trump might have seen other women at the time besides his wife -- and that throughout their relationship, he did not use protection.

On Friday, asked if the President still denied McDougal's allegations of an affair, Giuliani said: "I haven't asked him again. I don't know if that's changed, but none of this tape suggests that he did."
__label__world (CNN) The mayor of a town on the popular holiday destination of Cebu was killed Wednesday, two months after two other town mayors were shot in other parts of the Philippines.

Ronda Mayor Mariano Blanco was shot by unidentified gunman in his office building in the early hours of Wednesday morning, according to CNN Philippines

Provincial police said the investigation is ongoing and they have yet to identify any possible suspects or motive.

Blanco's death comes five months after the town's vice-mayor, Jonah John Ungab, was also killed by unidentified gunmen and two months after the mayors of Tanauan and General Tinio were shot dead. Police said it is unclear if any of the incidents are linked.

Tanauan City Mayor Antonio Halili was shot by a sniper in July during a flag-raising ceremony outside of the City Hall . The killing was captured on a video that showed scenes of panic seconds after the shot was fired.
__label__world (CNN) An isolated Amazon tribe with no known contact with the outside world has been spotted by a drone flying over the Brazilian jungle, according to the country's National Indian Foundation.

Footage released this week shows several people walking through a wide clearing made in a patch of dense jungle in the Javary River valley, near the border with Peru.

One of the figures is carrying a spear or pole of some kind, while four or five others stand near what look like thatched structures.

None of the people spotted by the drone appear to notice their observer, which is flying high above the trees surrounding them.

The foundation, known as Funai , is tasked with protecting the interests of indigenous tribes living in the Brazilian Amazon, many of whom have seen their homes devastated by colonialism and foreign diseases, as well as ongoing logging and mining operations.

__label__world Idlib, Syria (CNN) Locals in the village of Urem Kubra gesture to a man standing surrounded by rubble.

"He can't talk much. He's in shock," the village elder said, referring to 33-year-old Ibrahim Abu Naif.

On the wreckage of what used to be his house, Ibrahim set aside a neat pile of children's clothing he had dug out of the debris. He lifted a blue jacket with "sports" emblazoned on the back, and brought it to his face, taking in a whiff as he did so.

"This, this was Nayef's. He's gone," Ibrahim said of his 3-year-old son.

He pulled out more clothing: a red and white knit cardigan, a pair of tights with a Christmas pattern and a striped t-shirt. The clothes belonged to four of his children who were killed in last week's airstrikes.

He has one surviving child.

"Hatice. Hatice is alive and living at her grandparents. She has a head wound," Ibrahim told CNN, holding one of her pink sweaters.

When war planes struck Urem Kubra, a rebel-held village just outside Idlib province on Friday night, most of the women in the village were home with children, preparing dinner. The planes hovered in the air for around 10 minutes before the first strikes, witnesses said. The jets then swung back around, hitting the town two more times. More than 40 people were killed in 30 minutes, the majority of them women and children.

Ibrahim Dervish used to play right outside the ice cream shop with his friends who were killed in the airstrike. The shopkeeper would sometimes give them free ice cream. Ibrahim's favorite is mixed cherry and vanilla in a cone.

Ten-year-old Ibrahim Dervish wandered aimlessly around the Urem Kubra town square, a few meters from the ice cream shop where he and his friends used to play.

"I miss Mohammad Hasan, Mays and Omar," he said, listing his friends' names. They were all killed in the strike.

The ice cream shop was reduced to a heap of rubble. Dervish said he used to get vanilla and cherry flavored ice cream in a cone for 100 Syrian pounds ($1). The shop owner, he said, often gave them freebies.

"I'm sad that we don't have the shop anymore and that my friends are dead," Dervish said.

It is a scene that has played out across Syria for more than seven years. Idlib is one of several de-escalation zones agreed on by some of the war's main international actors, Russia, Turkey and Iran. Yet it has been repeatedly bombed, with airstrikes target alleged rebel posts, medical facilities and residential neighborhoods.

Last rebel stronghold

The Syrian government swept through rebel-held areas over the past year. Many residents and fighters from across Syria were transferred to Idlib and the northern countrysides of nearby provinces as part of opposition agreements with the government. As a result, the population of the northwestern province has doubled since the start of the war, and it is a bastion of Syria's opposition fighters.

But this is the last rebel stronghold, and the fighters and residents here have nowhere else to go.

There are also international interests regarding Idlib. Turkey is heavily involved here and insists it will protect the area against a government incursion. Still, the Russian-backed Syrian government has trained its sights on the province and seems intent on crushing the rebels. Fighting is incessant, and Idlib's ultimate fate is unknown.

Abdulkadir Halit opened a barber shop in the Rahme Cluster after his shop in Hama was destroyed in airstrikes. He cuts about six heads of hair per day at a cost of 200 Syrian pounds ($2).

United Nations estimates put the population here at more than 3 million. Most live in camps along the border with Turkey, which already has taken in 3.5 million Syrian refugees since the start of the war. But the Turkish border is now effectively closed, with Ankara choosing to prevent another wave of refugees from crossing by building a border wall and bolstering aid to Idlib.

"We have sent in a lot of humanitarian aid, set up military observation points and have taken on diplomatic efforts to sustain this area," said a senior Turkish official, who asked not to be named.

An assault on Idlib is a red line for Turkey. Negotiations are ostensibly under way between Russia, Iran and Turkey. But agreements are hard to come by in Syria. It plays host to many regional, local and international actors, each with its own shifting agendas.

Government leaflets

Earlier this month, Syrian government planes dropped leaflets on the city of Jisr Al Shugur in Idlib.

"Your cooperation with the Syrian Arab Army will get rid of the armed terrorists among you and will keep you and your families safe," the leaflet read.

For those who'd previously fled other opposition areas, this is an ominous sign. One activist, who was relocated to Idlib from Eastern Ghouta following a brutal government incursion there, said the leaflets were identical to ones he saw in Eastern Ghouta before a Russian and Syrian government assault overran the rebels there.

"I'm afraid the same thing will happen in Idlib," he told CNN, asking for his name not to be quoted. People in Idlib know the violence is closing in on them, but no one sees an escape route.

Halime Dervish was cooking in her kitchen when the airstrikes took place. Her two kids were wounded. They managed to get out of the house through a hole in a wall created by the blast.

An assault on Idlib would mean high casualties. The province is more tightly packed and more densely populated than other areas in the country.

Along the Turkish border, the white tents of the refugee camps have grayed with time. As residents build up concrete block walls and cement floors, the camps have taken on an air of permanence and transformed into sprawling slums. Shops selling wedding dresses, restaurants, and pharmacies have popped up.

For now, an uneasy calm has taken over.

Some of the first internally displaced people to move to Idlib's tent cities live in a makeshift district called the Rahme Cluster.

Hishan Hadar, 48, originally from the adjacent Hama, has been here for five years.

"This area started out as tents, but then over time people managed to build it up," he said.

He said the possibility of a Syrian regime operation leaves people in Idlib only one choice. "We have nothing to do but to defend. Either we die with honor, or we die with honor -- there is no other choice," he told CNN.

Others are even more resigned.

"There is no hope," says Sara Shahin who, along with her five children, has been in Rahme for six years. Her children may never see their native Kafra Buda in the countryside of the northeastern province of Hama. Her eldest son hopes to be married soon.

"He might marry here... my kids will grow up here... I have a feeling we will be here till we die," she said.

Vaciha Turki-Al Omar, 30, has been in Idlib for seven months. She stands on the hill overlooking the sprawling refugee camp with her kids. "We can try to fight, but the kids are our weakness so we must run away," she says.

Around the corner, in what has been transformed into the town's main street, Abdulkadir Halit, 25, has opened a barber shop after airstrikes destroyed his old shop in his native town of Hama.

"I would go back tomorrow if I could, and God willing, maybe I will," he told CNN.

A few doors down, smoke from a tiny restaurant wafts into the street. Hasan Ali is turning skewers of chicken and tomatoes over slow-burning coal. The 38-year-old cook says he has no sense of what will become of him and his family, but the thought of never returning to his hometown in Hama is unfathomable.

"Pain. That's what we feel. We left our home. What can we feel but pain?" he said while fanning the grill.

On the hills above the Rahme Cluster, children fly kites, old men reflect in a somber silence, and others revel in the open space. Vaciha Turki-Al Omar comes to the edge of a cliff and points out roughly where her tent is. Since the beginning of the war, this mother of eight has lost too many family members and loved ones to count.

The war brought with it a relentless move northward.

"We left because of airstrikes. Our home is gone, destroyed," she said. "This place is our last hope."

__label__politics Story highlights Jared Kushner has made multiple updates to his security clearance questionnaire

Democrats have called on the White House to revoke Kushner's security clearance

(CNN) The head of a government bureau responsible for clearing background checks told lawmakers Wednesday he has "never seen that level of mistakes" when asked about numerous omissions in Jared Kushner's security clearance application.

Charles Phalen, the director of the National Background Investigations Bureau, a newly created division within the Office of Personnel Management, made the comment in response to a question during a House subcommittee oversight hearing.

Democrats have called on the White House to revoke security clearances granted to Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and Ivanka Trump over reports of their use of personal email accounts and Kushner's multiple updates to his security clearance questionnaire, known as SF-86, for failing initially to include meeting with foreign officials.

Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois asked Phalen, "can you recall if there has ever been an applicant having to submit four addenda detailing over 100 errors and omissions being able to maintain their security clearance once those errors and omission have been identified?"

Phalen said he has not seen "the breadth" of all applications "but I have never seen that level of mistakes."

__label__world Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) The first time Le Tran Lua laid eyes on John McCain, he wanted to kill him.

"With a knife in my hand, I intended to stab him. But the people nearby shouted stop," he recalls.

Now, more than half a century after that dramatic first and only encounter with a US Navy pilot, Lua laments Sen. McCain's passing.

"I am very sad," Lua says of his former enemy's death. "I always wanted to meet him [again] since this was such a milestone in my life."

Le Tran Lua, 68, claims he helped drag John McCain out of Truc Bach Lake in Hanoi after McCain's jet was shot down.

Lua is a rail-thin Vietnamese grandfather with a gray ponytail who makes a living painting calligraphy next to Buddhist temples.

The 68-year-old sips sweet coffee in a Hanoi cafe as he recalls the afternoon when he first spotted McCain's parachute.

It was October 26, 1967. Lt. Cmdr. John McCain, a US Navy aviator, was piloting a bombing mission targeting a power plant when a surface-to-air missile hit his Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. He ejected from the stricken plane, deep inside enemy territory.

That day, Lua, then 17, was a mechanic at a paper factory. He says he was hiding in an air-raid shelter when he caught a glimpse of McCain's parachute.

"I immediately ran to my kitchen and grabbed a knife," Lua says. "I thought this was an invader who was trying to destroy our power plant and our city as well."

From a Hanoi cafe, Le Tran Lua recalls capturing McCain and laments his passing.

McCain splashed down in Truc Bach Lake, in the heart of Hanoi.

Lua says he dove in and swam straight toward the downed pilot.

"I grabbed his hair immediately," Lua says. "I did not speak English, so I shouted out in French 'haut le mains!'"

In other words, "Hands up!"

For Lua, the capture of an enemy pilot was one of the proudest achievements of his life. For McCain, it was the beginning of an ordeal as prisoner of war that lasted more than five years.

Flowers for an enemy

A small monument next to Truc Bach Lake celebrates the downing of McCain's plane. "The citizens and military caught Pilot John Sidney McCain," the statue's engraving says. "This was one of 10 aircraft shot down that same day."

But in the days after McCain's death, this monument has been transformed into a makeshift shrine. Admirers have been laying flowers, incense and money at the statue. The US Embassy in Hanoi laid a wreath there.

"We're not American," says a South African tourist, posing next to the monument for a photo with his wife. "But we respect the man."

After his capture, the North Vietnamese authorities brought the badly wounded McCain to Hoa Lo Prison. The former French colonial jail was infamously nicknamed by its American inmates the "Hanoi Hilton."

Hoa Lo Prison is now a museum where visitors can see the cells that held Vietnamese prisoners under French colonial rule, and those that held American prisoners of war.

McCain spent much of the next five-and-a-half years in captivity within its thick walls. Today, they block almost all reception from the city's cellphone towers.

Nowadays, Hoa Lo Prison is a state museum, frequented by throngs of young tourists dressed in shorts and sandals.

During his time in captivity here, McCain and other prisoners of war said, they were repeatedly beaten, left in solitary confinement, forced to sign confessions and denied medical treatment for serious injuries and wounds.

"I dreaded rope torture more than most other forms of abuse," McCain wrote in his 2005 memoir "Character is Destiny."

Tran Trong Duyet, 85, the former director of the Hoa Lo Prison, otherwise known as the "Hanoi Hilton," where John McCain was held as a prisoner of war.

"We were made to sit for hours on a stool a few inches shorter than the chair our interrogator occupied, with our arms behind our back, trussed in ropes wrapped in tight loops around our biceps and cinched around our waist... some prisoners, but not I, were hung by their ropes on hooks in the ceiling of the interrogation room. Others, again not I, were kept for weeks in ankle stocks or leg irons. Often, our interrogators beat the heck out of us."

The North Vietnamese offered McCain, whose father was the commander of US forces in the Pacific, an early release from captivity in exchange for a confession. In his 1999 memoir "Faith of my Fathers," McCain explained why he rejected the offer. He argued it would be a breach of the military's code of conduct, and serve as a propaganda victory for the North Vietnamese.

Former jailor

"I first met John McCain in 1967," says Tran Trong Duyet. "He was a tough and strong man. He was loyal to his ideology."

From 1968 to 1973, Duyet was the warden of Hoa Lo Prison. Today, the prison museum displays black-and-white photos of Duyet addressing rows of American inmates, shortly before their release in the winter of 1973 as part of the Paris Peace Accords.

McCain was among the prisoners sent home then.

Now 85 and long since retired, Duyet mourns the death of his former prisoner, a lawmaker whom he credits with helping reestablish diplomatic relations between the US and Vietnam. "If I met him now, I would wish him good health as a good friend always does," he says.

"Could you please send my deep condolences to his family and his wife. I wish to see his family and his wife in Vietnam," he adds.

Tran Trong Duyet denies that McCain was tortured in Hoa Lo Prison, where Duyet was warden from 1968 to 1973.

But Duyet denies that McCain and the other POW's were mistreated during captivity. "I think McCain told a lie in his book," he tells me.

"If we had tortured him, there would not have been the image of McCain coming back to Vietnam so many times and stimulating the Vietnam-US relationship."

Daniel Kritenbrik, the US ambassador to Hanoi, says there is no doubt that US prisoners were tortured. "It's absolutely clear and indisputable the torture that many of our veterans suffered," the ambassador says, speaking to CNN in a hallway of the US Embassy, which has been decorated with an American flag, bouquets of flowers and a portrait of McCain.

For three days this week, the US Embassy opened its doors to the public, allowing well-wishers to sign a book of condolences.

Among the Vietnamese visitors are a 35-year-old accountant named Vu Ngoc Son, who crosses himself and bows before McCain's portrait.

"Thank you very much Senator John McCain," Son writes in the condolence book. "Please help and continue supporting US and Vietnam -- stronger and happier."

Daniel Kritenbrink, US ambassador to Vietnam, says there is no doubt that US prisoners were tortured.

That message was echoed by Pham Quang Vinh, Vietnam's deputy foreign minister and former ambassador to Washington.

"I came to show the deepest respect for Sen. John McCain -- a great man, great statesman and a great friend of Vietnam," Vinh told CNN.

In 1995, McCain applauded the Clinton administration's decision to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

Kritenbrik argues that as a soldier and then a peacemaker, McCain played a central role in developing the extraordinarily close ties now enjoyed by two former enemy states. "It's close to miraculous to see how far we've come over the last few decades," the ambassador says.

"To go from the experiences of the war and the experiences of Sen. McCain and what we had here initially, to now be here today where we're talking about a partnership and a friendship."

McCain's indelible mark on Vietnam can be seen on the walls of the prison where he once languished. Not far from pictures of him as a wounded POW, there is a photo of a smiling McCain on a tour of the museum in 2000.

The senator often stopped in to the "Hanoi Hilton" during more than 20 trips to Vietnam. On one of those visits, the former prisoner left a short message in the museum's guest book. It reads:

Best wishes, John McCain

__label__politics Washington (CNN) FBI agent Peter Strzok was escorted from the FBI building Friday as part of the ongoing internal proceedings at the bureau on his conduct, according to a source familiar with the matter.

As of Tuesday, the source said, Strzok is still an FBI employee. He had a central role on the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information. He later worked on the investigation into connections between Trump campaign associates and Russia and briefly worked for special counsel Robert Mueller before text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page disparaging President Donald Trump were discovered.

Strzok is currently embroiled in an internal FBI investigation stemming from findings in outlined in a report from the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, which details a number of private text messages and use of personal email for FBI business.

Last week, Horowitz, released an exhaustive report on the FBI's conduct in the Clinton probe and found that Strzok's texts "cast a cloud" over the entire FBI investigation. The report concluded that there was no evidence "to connect the political views expressed in these messages to the specific investigative decisions" that were the subject of controversy, such as allowing immunity agreements or having fact witnesses sit in on others' interviews prior to July 5, 2016, the day then-FBI Director James Comey issued a statement on the Clinton investigation that cleared her.

However, Horowitz was troubled by the FBI's month-long delay in obtaining a search warrant to review emails possibly related to the investigation on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop in the fall of 2016. The report specifically calls out Strzok's decision to "prioritize" the Russia investigation over following-up on the laptop issue, leaving the report unable to conclude it was "free from bias."

__label__politics Story highlights Mueller was named the special counsel the next day

He previously held the post of FBI chief

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump interviewed Robert Mueller as a potential replacement for fired FBI Director James Comey the day before the former FBI director was named special counsel, a White House official said Tuesday.

The official, who would not detail what the two discussed during the interview, said it took place on May 16.

If Mueller knew he was going to be named special counsel, it is unlikely he divulged that information to Trump. CNN has reported at the time that the White House was given only a brief heads up that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was naming Mueller to oversee Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion from Trump's campaign associates.

Conservative media, led by Newsmax CEO and Trump friend Chris Ruddy, have suggested that the interview shows Mueller has a conflict in his special counsel investigation.

__label__world (CNN) Uganda's pop star-turned-MP Bobi Wine was "violently arrested" and "bundled into a police ambulance" Thursday as he was on his way out of the country, his lawyer said.

"The Uganda Police have violently blocked Hon Bobi Wine from traveling outside of the country in spite of the court declining to do so when being released on bail earlier in the week. This is absurd to say the least," lawyer Nicholas Opiyo said on Twitter.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was first arrested by the military on August 15 after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election.

He has been in and out of court since then, most recently having been freed on bail Monday.

Wine was on his way out of the country to seek medical treatment in the United States and was prevented from boarding a flight at around 8 p.m. local time, according to his legal team.

__label__politics Pittsburgh (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden drew contrasts with President Donald Trump in style and on substance during a series of Labor Day appearances here on Monday, even as he continued to dodge questions about his 2020 plans.

"We're in a fight for the soul of America," Biden said from the steps of a Catholic church following morning services, as he prepared to march with workers in one of the largest Labor Day parades in the country. "Everything" is at stake in the coming midterm elections, Biden added.

Biden's appearance Monday marked his third stop at the parade in four years, and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, whose re-election campaign Biden sought to boost with his visit, said he has become "a familiar face" at the event.

But the timing of Biden's appearance raised further suspicions about his plans as he mulls another presidential bid in 2020, a process that has seen the 75-year-old raise his public profile at political events in recent months. As he marched and mingled Monday, union members urged him to run, with Biden grinning noncommittally in response. He literally did run, however -- down the street through crowds of people , with some cheering him on -- prompting numerous puns on social media.

The former Vice President insisted his decision to march in the parade "doesn't mean anything for my political future."

__label__politics Story highlights Manhattan district attorney says Democratic mayor's actions "appear contrary to the intent and spirit" of the laws

Bill de Blasio was sworn in as New York's 109th mayor in January 2014

New York (CNN) Federal and state investigations into the fundraising practices of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have concluded without criminal charges, even though the Manhattan district attorney said Thursday the actions of the Democratic mayor appeared contrary to the "intent and spirit" of campaign finance laws.

In a "rare" statement about the status of an investigation, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York said the office, along with the FBI, had looked into donations solicited by de Blasio's 2013 campaign and others "from individuals who sought official favors from the city, after which the mayor made or directed inquiries to relevant city agencies on behalf of those donors."

"After careful deliberation, given the totality of the circumstances here and absent additional evidence, we do not intend to bring federal criminal charges against the mayor or those acting on his behalf relating to the fundraising efforts in question," acting US Attorney Joon Kim said in a statement.

The announcement comes nearly a week after Kim's predecessor, Preet Bharara, tweeted Saturday that he was fired after his refusal to resign as requested by President Donald Trump's administration.

Bharara's refusal created a stunning public standoff last week, as 46 US attorneys across the country were asked to tender their resignations.

(CNN) The Trump administration's latest efforts to undo more of Barack Obama's efforts to slow climate change come as no surprise. Nothing gets this President more excited than trying to undo his predecessor's legacy.

But his proposed new EPA rules -- tagged with the laughable misnomer the "Affordable Clean Energy" rule -- are not just vindictive, they are dangerous. The administration wants to allow coal-burning power plants to emit more deadly carbon and to give states greater leeway to allow big-money companies to pollute. The new rules would replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions.

The proposal reflects a longstanding and fundamentally damaging idea in right-wing politics: That climate change is a matter of opinion, not fact, and that people who have no interest in the facts still deserve to hold political office.

The deluded perspective is not confined to America's Republican Party. Conservatives in Australia have also latched on to the theory that climate change is debatable, and that efforts to fight it are a liberal conspiracy against big business.

The GOP has long been in the pocket of polluters , who have made clear that they are quite comfortable destroying the planet for our children and grandchildren in return for getting rich now. The party has helped to make this denialism politically feasible by systematically undermining the public education system and refusing the validity of scientific inquiry. Do they believe in evolution yet?

That the new Trump rules will cost thousands of lives -- 1,400 every year by the EPA's own admission -- doesn't seem to matter to this President and his GOP enablers, who put corporate profits first, ahead of citizens' health. In this, they are joined by a base that seems willing to accept any lie, indignity or even undermining of health and life.

It's a sad state of affairs -- but also a real and growing threat to a country experiencing wild weather mood swings, the largest wildfires in recorded history, floods, droughts and on and on.

In any reasonable universe, those who deny basic scientific facts that connect this grim reality to humans' role in global warming would be deemed unfit to hold office. Imagine a congressman who questioned whether gravity was real, or a senator who insisted the earth was flat. We would rightly say that they're intellectually deficient, and that their bizarre theories mean they probably shouldn't be making vital decisions that affect millions of Americans (not to mention billions more people around the world).

But somehow climate change falls in a different category (along with, among a majority of evangelical protestants, for example, a disbelief in evolution).

It's one thing to be ignorant -- and, to be sure, many non-climate-change-denying Americans don't understand the basics of climate change either. But most Americans also don't understand the details of how a bill becomes law, how our court system works, or how the national budget gets set -- all things we expect of our nationally elected officials.

Politicians should similarly be expected to understand the basic science of climate change, and to listen to the scientific experts instead of seeking out the few outliers who confirm their own half-baked beliefs.

Of course, Trump has appointed a series of cronies and amateurs to his cabinet, and he himself holds the highest office in the land, with zero previous experience for the job, zero intellectual curiosity, and zero ability to train his attention on just about anything other than Twitter and Fox News.

His presidency makes full mockery of the theory that those in charge should know anything at all. And with this latest green light to polluters and contaminators, all of us are again paying the price for that unapologetic greed and ignorance.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Top intelligence officials indicated on Tuesday that the GOP was also a Russian hacking target but that none of the information obtained was leaked.

FBI director James Comey told a Senate panel that there was "penetration on the Republican side of the aisle and old Republican National Committee domains" no longer in use. Republicans have previously denied their organizations were hacked.

The testimony came in a Senate intelligence committee hearing that examined Russia's intrusions in the 2016 election campaign and its intentions, with America's top intelligence officials testifying just days after they released an unclassified report blaming Moscow for the hacks.

Comey later added that "there was evidence of hacking directed at state-level organizations, state-level campaigns, and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC, meaning old emails they weren't using. None of that was released."

Comey said there was no sign "that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked."

Asked by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, whether the hacker had the ability to selectively leak that old information, Comey indicated that they did.

Comey also said that the Russians "got far deeper and wider into the (Democratic National Committee) than the RNC," adding that "similar techniques were used in both cases."

Comey said the FBI would have preferred to "get access to the original device or server" that was the target of hacking at the DNC. CNN previously reported that the Democratic National Committee "rebuffed" a request from the FBI to examine its computer services after it was allegedly hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.

The FBI instead relied on the assessment of a third-party security company called CrowdStrIke. Comey told senators that the "highly respected private company eventually got access and shared" the evidence with the FBI.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate committee, examining the cyber breaches, that the intelligence community concluded with "high confidence" that Russia hacked the election to "denigrate" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and contrast her unfavorably to Republican Donald Trump.

"We have multiple high-quality sources that contribute to that assessment," Clapper said. "Attributing cyber operations is difficult but not impossible."

When Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin thought Trump was going to be the likely winner, Clapper responded, "Initially, no. They thought he was a fringe candidate and didn't think that at all."

Clapper said the intelligence community's report on the hacking was based on a variety of sources, including technical data, open-source information and human sources as well. He declined to offer more detail on how the information was collection in order to protect sources.

CIA Director John Brennan said that had called the director of a Russian intelligence agency behind the hacks and warned the Russians that they were playing with fire, a message the Russian said he'd pass on to Putin.

Clapper said that the response to activist attacks of this sort has to be carefully considered.

"It's not our call what to do in response," he said of the intelligence community. He said that policy makers and politicians should "consider the whole range of tools to respond."

"The challenge you get into with cyber for cyber, of course, you also have to consider the counter-retaliation to that," Clapper said. "While we spend a lot of time worrying about precision and being surgical, our adversaries" might not be that careful.

Clapper was asked whether intelligence agencies had found that people close to Trump had business interests that would make the Russians predisposed to favor Trump.

"The Russians just believed, or came to the conclusion, that because the President-elect is a businessman, that he would be easier to make deals with than the Democrats," Clapper said.

There were frequent questions about ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the hearing. Earlier on, Comey refused to comment on whether the FBI is investigating any potential connections.

"I would never comment on investigations," Comey told Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who repeatedly pushed the FBI director to release any information it had before Inauguration Day.

"If it doesn't happen before Jan. 20, I'm not sure it's going to happen," Wyden said.

But Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent, alluded tartly to Comey's very public statements about investigations into Clinton during the election campaign -- "the irony of you making that statement I cannot avoid."

Comey said that there was a difference between open and closed investigations. He pushed back on King, saying, "You asked me if you have any pending investigations and we're not going to talk about that."

He added that "I'm tone deaf on politics and that's as it should be."

Tuesday's hearing is the first public examination of Russia's activities since Trump received a briefing from the country's top intelligence officials on Moscow's interference in the presidential election.

The 17 US intelligence agencies already issued a statement in October expressing their unanimous assessment that Moscow had probed state election voting centers and penetrated the email accounts of Democratic groups and individuals. Much of that information was made public through the organization WikiLeaks, lead by Julian Assange.

In the classified and declassified reports released last week, they outlined their findings that Putin directly ordered the "influence campaign."

Republicans and Democrats both called for a thorough investigation into Russia's hacking of the presidential election Tuesday, reaffirming their confidence in US intelligence agencies' findings even as Trump has continued to downplay them.

The report "gives me no reason to doubt the findings," said the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, North Carolina Republican Richard Burr. "We owe it to the American people to do an independent and bipartisan review."

After the conclusion of the public session, Burr said that the hearing would continue in a classified setting.

Congressional Democrats are pushing for a bipartisan, independent commission to look into the hacks. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said last week that she and other senators will soon introduce a similar bill, while House lawmakers introduced one in early December and re-introduced it again last week.

Republicans have preferred to limit investigations to congressional committees they control. On Tuesday, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, California's Adam Schiff, said "the seriousness of these allegations warrant the most thorough and non-partisan of investigations."

Another California Democrat on the committee, Eric Swalwell, said the "best way forward is to have an independent, bipartisan commission that can depoliticize this. The Democrats were the victims this time," but "it could be the Republicans next time. The constant should be that both parties care about our democracy. There's plenty of room for Republicans to come on board."

In the final run-up to Nov. 9, Russia shifted its focus from influencing the campaign to undermining the validity of the results, a theme that Trump himself began to stress on the campaign trail, telling people the election was going to be "rigged."
__label__world (CNN) After 75 years, researchers have discovered the stern of a World War II destroyer off the coast of Alaska and presumably, the final resting place of 70 crew members who were never found after the vessel was hit by a Japanese mine.

Project Recover, a team funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, first found the remains of the USS Abner Read in July, according to a statement Wednesday on its website.

The general area has been known for years, but researchers focused on finding the stern this year. In July, sonar found a potential site and the team sent an unmanned vehicle down for a look.

The stern, 75 feet long and about 18 feet high, was encrusted with sea life but it was unmistakable. The search team also saw a gun and rudder control.

"We've entered a new age of exploration," Mark Moline, director of the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware and co-founder of Project Recover, said this week, according to a news release. "New sensors and improved underwater robots that can bring back real-time images are driving new discoveries."

75 years ago

More than 300 men were aboard the Abner Read as it sailed near an island of the US territory of Alaska 75 years ago, hunting for Japanese submarines.

About 1:50 a.m. on August 18, 1943, a huge explosion separated the stern from the ship and more than 90 sailors went into the water. About 20 were rescued, one body was pulled from the Bering Sea, but 70 men were never found.

Daryl Weathers, a ship fitter on the Abner Read, said Wednesday he was surprised by the news they had found the World War II ship's sheared stern.

"That's the end of the world up there," he said from his home in Seal Beach, near Los Angeles.

Weathers, 94, said the crew tried to save their shipmates but oil had spilled into the cold water and it was tough to pull people out.

"They were slippery and you couldn't keep ahold of them," he said. The crew put a boat in the water and threw floatation gear for the men but the conditions prevented many from being rescued.

Hallowed ground

The stern and the remains will stay where they are. It is hallowed ground, explained Paul Taylor of the Naval History and Heritage Command.

"The Navy has a longstanding tradition that sites like these are a fit and final resting place for those who perished at sea," he said. "It's a war grave and we treat it as such."

Searchers used an underwater robot to search for the stern in July.

The men are listed among the more than 72,000 Americans missing after the war, online records show

The crew of the Abner Read was able to save the ship and it was towed back to port by the USS Bancroft, another destroyer. The Abner Read then sailed to Bremerton, Washington, where it was repaired and in two months was back in the war in the Pacific. It was sunk in November 1944 by a Japanese dive bomber.

Oil-covered men drown in frigid water

Weathers vividly recalled being on radar watch the night the explosion happened near Kiska Island, which the Japanese had just evacuated.

The Abner Read was doing figure-eights in the water, looking for submarines.

Many of the men were relaxed because the surveillance came as the Aleutian Islands Campaign, which included the only battles on North American soil during World War II, was winding down after some brutal fighting.

The ship had been in the area for two days without any concerns. The water was smooth and the moon was peeking through clouds.

Weathers said the crew at first thought they had been hit by a torpedo and were waiting for another attack.

Weathers said he was lucky to be on duty because the mine hit near where he would have been sleeping.

"I probably wouldn't have made it," he said.

He barely made it through the Abner Read's final battle, during which he was manning a gun that fired on the incoming dive bomber. They shot off a wing, but the plane kept coming, slamming into the ship just above his gun tub.

"I was hurt pretty bad," he said, adding he was knocked out for a few minutes. When he came to, everything was on fire -- including him. "I thought, I better get out of here" and started running, he said.

The USS Abner Read underwent repairs at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington.

A comrade gave him shots of morphine and a friend supplied him with a life jacket.

Weathers spent the next seven months in a stateside hospital, then a few months on another ship until the war ended.

He said the crew used to have reunions until about six or seven years ago when health issues prevented survivors from attending. Now he thinks he is the probably the only one left.

He was surprised people were still looking for the Abner Read's stern and he was told the occasion of the incident will be marked this weekend.

Taylor said the explorers gathered a lot of data from their examinations of the stern.

It will take some time to see what the information reveals, he said.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) — The first major book focusing on The first major book focusing on Vice President Mike Pence during his time in the executive branch is set to be released Tuesday.

Penned by authors Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner, Shadow President: The Truth about Mike Pence purports that the vice president's rise in politics has been carefully calculated through the years. It draws contrasts between Pence and President Donald Trump, but also comparisons in their use of mass media (Pence once had a radio show in Indiana and jokes he is "Rush Limbaugh on decaf") to build profiles in separate political circles over the years.

The authors deem Pence a "replacement president," pointing to his recent trips this year to Israel and South Korea where he presided over "landmark events."

Between his political connections to the religious right and powerful fundraising groups, a Trump administration filled with many of his proteges and friends, and his statesman approach to the world stage, D'Antonio and Eisner paint Pence as a "shadow president."

Pence's office did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Monday that he hopes former CIA Director John Brennan will bring forward a lawsuit against the Trump administration for revoking his security clearance last week.

"I hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country's history, brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won't sue!" Trump tweeted Monday.

I hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country's history, brings a lawsuit.

He won't sue! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 20, 2018

Brennan said Sunday that he was willing to pursue legal action against Trump, telling NBC's "Meet the Press" that he's "going to do whatever I can personally to try to prevent these abuses in the future, and if it means going to court, I will do that."

Brennan has been a harsh critic of the Trump administration, going so far as to call Trump's actions alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin in a news conference after their summit in Helsinki, Finland, "nothing short of treasonous."

Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance Wednesday, saying Brennan's history "calls into question his objectivity and credibility." The President later connected his decision to revoke Brennan's clearance with the former CIA director's involvement in the Russia investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported

Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it's worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn't because of the good job he did! He is a political "hack." — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 20, 2018

__label__politics (CNN) Georgia's shotgun-toting, Trump-style Republican candidate for governor Brian Kemp has sought to assure voters that his state's election system is secure and that any allegations to the contrary are "fake news."

But Kemp, who is also the secretary of state in charge of Georgia's elections, is now being accused in a federal lawsuit of failing to secure his state's voting system and allowing a massive breach that exposed voter records and other sensitive election information.

The allegations in the lawsuit come as the subject of election security has come into focus nationally, particularly as the November's midterm elections approach. The suit describes how a private researcher discovered the records of more than 6 million registered Georgia voters, password files and encryption keys could be accessed online by anyone looking. Days after the lawsuit was filed, technicians erased the hard drives of the server in question.

Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in the suit, argues Kemp's office long neglected basic security standards and says it remains unclear if the state's election system was infected with malware or breached by foreign hackers, which she says could have consequences for the midterm elections. She said because the data was destroyed, an independent review cannot be conducted.

Her group's lawsuit seeks to force the state to implement paper ballot-based voting so that results can be audited.

"The data was open to anyone in the world who had an internet connection," said Marks. "Even when confronted with a security disaster, [Kemp's] response was to blame managers under his supervision for their incompetence and leave the security disaster without so much as a forensic review of the impacts of the security failures."

In response to CNN's questions about the lawsuit and the state's elections system, Kemp said Georgia's voting equipment "remains accurate and secure." He added, "The hysteria of some people seeking to force Georgia to switch to an all paper ballot system is based on misinformation, and making this change would spend money to create problems that we should avoid."

"The chaos of switching to a completely different voting system this close to an election would cause inconvenience, voter confusion, and potentially suppressed turn-out," Kemp said.

The exposure of Georgia's election system's vulnerability dates back to August 2016, when private cybersecurity researcher Logan Lamb discovered 15-gigabytes worth of voter registration data and other sensitive information could be readily downloaded from the website of Kennesaw State University.

Kemp's office had a contract with KSU's Center for Election Systems to help run Georgia's voting system. Lamb says the center's website was like a door without a lock.

A recent indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller notes that in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election Russian intelligence operatives visited "websites of certain counties in Georgia ... to identify vulnerabilities." Kemp's office said the indictment revealed only visits, not penetration of any Georgia systems by Russians.

"The website security itself is inexcusable," Lamb told CNN. "Never mind the nation-state threats of countries like Russia, it could have easily been compromised by [anyone]."

Following his discovery, Lamb emailed the executive director of KSU's election center, Merle King, to alert him about the vulnerability. According to Lamb and court filings, King told him that the issues would be addressed but added that Lamb should keep quiet about his findings, otherwise he would be "crushed" by the politicians "downtown." King did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Internal emails show KSU's technology staff acknowledged the elections system had "40+ critical vulnerabilities" in October 2016, but when Lamb and a colleague checked the website more than six months after his original discovery, he says, the vulnerabilities remained.

Lamb's colleague notified a KSU faculty member, who then alerted the university's technology services office, which finally firewalled the website in March 2017, according to the lawsuit and a KSU report filed in court.

An investigation was launched by the FBI and closed without comment.

A KSU statement in March 2017 stated that, based on a briefing by the FBI, there was no indication of illegal activity and no personal information was misused. The university said university employees "immediately isolated the server and contacted the Office of the Secretary of State" when its officials were notified in March.

Kemp called the breach "deeply concerning," and although he announced plans to end the arrangement with the center, his office renewed the KSU contract to manage the election system one last time in July 2017.

Kemp did not openly criticize KSU until a letter from the state attorney's office sent in October revealed KSU staffers had wiped the election system's hard drives, deleting potential evidence relevant to the lawsuit. The disclosure prompted outrage from the lawsuit's plaintiffs and was detailed in a report by the Associated Press.

A KSU spokesperson did not respond to CNN's questions about why the server's hard drives were wiped.

Kemp responded with a Facebook post in which he called the decision "reckless" and condemned "undeniable ineptitude at KSU's Center for Election Systems."

Charles Amlaner, a former vice president for research at KSU who signed some of the university's contracts, said Kemp's office did not include data security specifications in its election-system contracts with KSU for years . He said he found that unusual because most other government contracts involving sensitive data he has reviewed have contained multiple pages outlining security requirements.

"These contracts were pretty slim on detail. If you don't give us rules and regulations on data security, how do you expect us to abide by them?" he said.

In response, Kemp's office said the university had security protocols in place but didn't follow them.

"There were extensive security protocols in place at the university, and every part of the university -- including the Center for Elections Systems -- was expected to follow them," said Candice Broce, spokeswoman for the Georgia Secretary of State's office. "When the Center failed to comply, the state added additional security provisions before ultimately terminating this contract and moving all operations in-house. Secretary Kemp made the right call."

A review of two contracts by CNN found that only after the breach's exposure in 2017 was language inserted mandating that the center "implement data security policies that adhere to all current IT policies."

The contract with KSU's Center for Elections Systems ended, but Kemp's office offered a job to a director of the center.

Kemp has criticized news reports that raise questions about the integrity of state election systems. He wrote in a recent USA Today op-ed that states are doing enough to secure their own voting systems.

Kemp also blasted efforts by the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration to label states' voting systems "critical infrastructure" in 2016, which would enable the federal government to give states cybersecurity assistance. He has described the proposed designation as federal government overreach.

Although he has said the implementation of paper ballots for the upcoming November elections is unnecessary, Kemp leads a Georgia commission researching ways to improve the state's aging voter system and he supports the deployment of a new system by the 2020 election.

Georgia is one of only a few states that currently use voting machines statewide without paper trails. Paper records make manual recounts possible in the event of a contested election or alleged tampering.

Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech professor who studies election security and computer science, said he is concerned by the absolute assurance with which Kemp talks about Georgia's election system's security because there's no evidence the state has conducted a forensic review of all its servers. He said improvements to Georgia's voting system should have been implemented years ago.

"To say Georgia's system is totally secure you would have to believe there is a magic umbrella over the state protecting it," DeMillo said. "I don't understand where that reasoning comes from."
__label__world (CNN) When Ael left home to go to school in Jakarta, his parents warned him to be careful in the big city. "Be a kind person," his mother told him.

He worked hard and found a good job as a teacher in the sprawling Indonesian capital, but seven years later the 23-year-old is fearful for his future as a young gay man in a country which increasingly views homosexuality as a sin and, potentially soon, a crime.

"Many people don't like us ... they don't like us being more visible, so they are preparing laws that can criminalize us," Ael, who asked for his surname to not be used, told CNN.

Within weeks, lawmakers could vote on a new law that looks set to criminalize sex outside of marriage and homosexual sex in Indonesia, as part of wide-reaching changes to the country's criminal code.

"If the penal code is approved, I don't know our future in Indonesia," Ael said.

It is just the latest move in a widespread crackdown on Indonesia's gay and lesbian community since 2015 , which has shocked and horrified the country's LGBT population.

Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim-majority country, home to hundreds of millions of followers of the Islamic faith, but until recently it was relatively tolerant, if not exactly accepting, of its LGBT population.

But in the last decade a conservative strain of Islam, quietly tolerated by presidents past and present, has gained sway, with conservative Muslim leaders and groups intimidating lawmakers, holding mass rallies in Jakarta and targeting prominent Christian and LGBT minorities.

"(Recently) when LGBT Indonesians open our social media, quickly we find there are lots of people speaking hatefully about us," Ael said.

"As a gay person and a young person in Indonesia this issue has actually become dangerous for us."

The local LGBT community isn't alone in worrying about the developments. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said at a press conference in Jakarta on February 7 he was "greatly concerned" about the proposed revisions of the penal code.

He said the proposed amendments were "discriminatory" and appeared to be planned for "cynical political purposes."

'Indonesian values and culture'

In one of the latest drafts of the bill seen by CNN, committing an "obscene act" with someone of the same gender is punishable by a fine and up to 18 months in jail, if the act is public. It doesn't detail what could constitute an obscene act.

If the acts are "publicized in the form of pornography," the sentence could be up to nine years.

Activists had breathed a sigh of relief in December 2017, when Indonesia's Constitutional Court narrowly voted down a call for the criminalization of LGBT relations brought by a group of conservative Muslims. But the court's decision now appears to have only been a temporary reprieve.

No date has been set for the vote on the new criminal code, but a conservative lawmaker told CNN strict new restrictions against same sex-relations and extramarital sex will be included, no matter what.

"Basically all factions in the Parliament agree on the expansion of extra-marital sex articles and the inclusion of certain deviating acts of LGBT," said Arsul Sani, a politician with the conservative Islamic United Development Party (PPP).

Sani, who has a seat on the influential law and human rights panel that will approve the draft criminal code, said criminalizing sex outside marriage and same-sex relations will bring Indonesia's outdated criminal code in line with the rest of the country's "religious values."

"Those who oppose (the law) base their perspectives on Western cultures and values, whilst we propose this new criminal code upon Indonesian indigenous values and culture," he said.

While many conservative Islamic Indonesian politicians would like same-sex relations to be banned entirely, the existence of large, secular majority parties could lead to the compromise of seeing it only outlawed "in public."

Sani's fellow panel member Ichsan Soelistio, lawmaker with the secular Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP), said while it was true there was majority support for the new criminal code, full criminalization of same-sex relations is out of the question.

"We (will) still protect their private lives, including their sex life, as long as they don't do it in a public area," he told CNN.

Soelistio said the law couldn't reach into people's private lives if there was no complaints from the parties involved.

"This will go to a vote maybe around one or two months after our recess, which ends on March 4 ... I believe (the new code) will be good for Indonesia," he said.

Despite its widely held Muslim beliefs, Indonesia's population didn't always openly discriminate against LGBT people.

"Indonesia has a long history of tolerance towards queer communities. It's always been described as one of the most tolerant countries in Southeast Asia to its queer population," Tim Lindsey, director of the Center for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society at the University of Melbourne, told CNN.

But a recent poll by Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting released in January found 87.6% of Indonesians believed LGBT people were a threat to Indonesia , while a 2013 Pew Research poll found 93% of Indonesians thought homosexuality was "morally unacceptable.

However despite many citizens' deeply-held Islamic beliefs, not everyone is in favor of the complete criminalization of homosexuality.

Jakarta resident, Viana, told CNN that while her Muslim faith prohibited homosexuality she didn't want LGBT people to be sent to jail.

"I don't want homosexuality to spread (but) I think it should not be criminalized. Rather people should get better religious education," she said.

More than 70,000 people have signed a petition, started by women's rights activists, calling for lawmakers to throw out the new draft but experts say that secular politicians are unlikely to take up the cause.

'Sissies'

In recent months Indonesian authorities have grown bolder in their attacks on the country's LGBT population.

Before dawn on January 28, police raided beauty salons in conservative Aceh province, dragging 12 transgender women out to the streets. The women were then shaved, taken into custody and forced to act as men.

In a video taken shortly after the raid, North Aceh Police Chief Ahmad Untung Surianata speaks to a crowd that gathered to watch the arrests, describing the group of women as part of a "disease."

"This "disease" is contagious and growing ... It is inhumane if I let the number of sissies increase in this area," he tells the crowd.

Speaking to CNN days after the incident, Surianata insisted it had not been an anti-LGBT operation but instead a drug raid to investigate reports of crystal meth being circulated in the area.

Jakarta-based activist Kate Walton said the violence shocked and horrified Indonesia's already nervous LGBT community.

"One concerning element was that the police chief said he had the right to do this because he had consulted with Islamic leaders beforehand," she said.

"So people are starting to ask -- who is really in charge in Aceh? The government or the religious leaders?"

The rise of powerful Islamic conservatives in Indonesia, mostly unopposed by senior politicians, has emboldened authorities with a low opinion of LGBT people to act against them.

An Indonesian man, one of two to be publicly caned for having homosexual sex, is punished in Banda Aceh on May 23, 2017.

UN Human Rights head Zeid said he found the recent "extremist views" playing out across Indonesia "deeply worrying," during his visit in February.

"Accompanied as they are by rising levels of incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence in various parts of the country, including Aceh," he said.

"Islamophobia is wrong. Discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs and color is wrong. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or any other status is wrong," he said.

'We should fight together'

It's no coincidence the brutal crackdown on LGBT Indonesians and the showdown over the criminal code comes just before a series of national elections, set to take place over the next 14 months.

Indonesia's 'archaic' penal code Lawmakers in Indonesia have been trying to agree on a new version of their criminal code for years -- to replace the system of laws first put in place by Dutch colonists. "Imagine running any modern country with a code which was written in the 1880s. It's not going to work," Tim Lindsey, director of the Center for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society at the University of Melbourne, told CNN. He says the outdated code imposes inappropriate penalties which are no longer used because they're archaic or fines that are ridiculously low. So far attempts to bring together Indonesia's fractious national parliament to fix the code of laws have been unsuccessful. "There hasn't been consensus on a range of difficult issues from the death penalty, to religion and blasphemy, to defamation," he said. The National Alliance on Reform of the Indonesian Criminal Code (Reformasi KUHP) was formed in 2005 to address this very issue, but even they have come out against the current draft of the new code. The organization said it was concerned the new criminal code could negatively affect Indonesia's democracy and freedom of expression, while harming the country's "vulnerable groups."

Local elections for governors and mayors across Indonesia's dozens of provinces are due to take place in June 2018, while Indonesian President Joko Widodo faces a battle for re-election in April 2019.

Indonesian politicians are scared to oppose conservative Muslim groups after they were instrumental in the toppling and imprisonment of once-popular Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as Ahok, in May 2017 , Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono said.

"Many Islamist leaders are going to put pressure on every politician (to pass the criminal code) ... Many politicians in a conservative country like Indonesia will think twice before standing up for an LGBT individual," he said.

It isn't unusual for harsh rhetoric against minorities such as LGBT Indonesians to be used prior to an election to gain votes, but unlike in previous political cycles, experts believe the current hostile environment could be here to stay.

There is no confirmed date for when the final vote on the criminal code will come, or what form the final legislation might take. A vote was postponed in mid-February and activists say it could take place in April, when the next plenary session in Indonesia's parliament is scheduled.

Despite the looming possibility of criminalization and even a jail sentence, Ael said he had never for a moment thought about leaving Indonesia, despite the growing hostility towards LGBT people such as himself.

"I've never imagined that situation because we should fight for this issue. Who will work for this issue if all of us young people go out from this country?" he told CNN.

"We are the future of this country so we should fight for this issue. We should fight together."
__label__world (CNN) For more than three decades, the Catholic Church has been rocked by sex abuse scandals spanning the globe.

And for decades, the church has been accused of protecting itself rather than the victims of child sexual abuse.

Here are some major scandals and revelations involving the Catholic Church and allegations of abuse.

USA, 2018

The report said internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania -- some held in a secret archive to which only the bishop had a key -- showed that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims.

The letter directly referred to the Pennsylvania report, which "detailed the experiences of at least 1,000 survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately 70 years."

Looking ahead, the pontiff said the church was working on a "zero tolerance" policy on abuse and coverups. He added, "If, in the past, the response was one of omission, today we want solidarity, in the deepest and most challenging sense, to become our way of forging present and future history."

USA, 2018

In July 2018, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, who once led the Archdiocese of Washington and was a force in American politics, after a decades-old allegation of sexual abuse of a teenage altar boy forced the Vatican to remove him from public ministry.

A month earlier, McCarrick issued a statement saying he was shocked by the allegations: "While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people."

McCarrick was also accused three times of sexual misconduct with adults "decades ago" while he served as a bishop in Metuchen and Newark, New Jersey, the current bishops of those cities said in June. Two of those allegations resulted in settlements, the bishops said.

The Vatican said Pope Francis had ordered McCarrick to "a life of prayer and penance until the accusations made against him are examined in a regular canonical trial."

Chile, 2018

Pope Francis called the country's bishops to Rome in May after he received a 2,300-page report detailing sexual abuses by priests in Chile.

The report alleged that for decades, church officials in Chile had known about cases of sexual abuse and led a massive cover up, even destroying records.

Seven years earlier, the Vatican had found Chilean priest Father Fernando Karadima guilty of child sex abuse.

In January, while visiting Chile, Francis defended a Chilean bishop accused of concealing the abuse, saying he had been "slandered."

But after Vatican investigators said church officials in Chile had helped cover up multiple cases of sexual abuse by the clergy, the Pope apologized.

After the 3-day emergency summit at the Vatican in May to discuss the sex abuse scandal, all 34 of Chile's active and retired bishops offered the Pope their resignations.

In August, police arrested one former priest over the alleged abuse of seven minors. Prosecutors say there are 158 people including bishops, priests and lay people under investigation.

Australia, 2018

Wilson was the highest-ranking Catholic official ever to be convicted of covering up sex abuse.

In July he said that he intended to appeal the ruling under the "due process of law" and would resign if his appeal was unsuccessful.

The next week the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had accepted Wilson's resignation.

Australia, 2017

Australian Cardinal George Pell was charged with historical child sex offenses.

Cardinal George Pell, one of the most senior members of the Catholic Church, was charged with multiple historical sexual assault offenses in his home country of Australia, police said in June.

Pell serves as a top adviser to Pope Francis and heads the Vatican's secretariat for the economy. In 2013, he was named one of eight cardinals tasked with investigating ways to reform the church. He is the most senior member of the Catholic Church in Australia but has been placed on leave from the Vatican while the allegations are investigated.

Pell said he's innocent and maintains that the charges -- relating to claims of sexual abuse spanning three decades -- are false.

In May 2018, a magistrate ordered him to stand trial and he entered a formal plea of not guilty.

In a statement, the Vatican said: "The Holy See has taken note of the decision issued by judicial authorities in Australia regarding His Eminence Cardinal George Pell. Last year, the Holy Father granted Cardinal Pell a leave of absence so he could defend himself from the accusations. The leave of absence is still in place."

A 2017 commission found that 7% of Australian priests were accused of abusing children between 1950 and 2015.

Dominican Republic, 2014

Jozef Wesolowski died in 2015 before he went to trial.

Jozef Wesolowski, a former Vatican ambassador to the Dominican Republic was found guilty of sexual abuse of minors by a Vatican tribunal and defrocked in 2014. He was accused of sexual abuse of minors and possession of child pornography during his time as papal nuncio to the Dominican Republic. Italy's Corriere della Sera reported that Wesolowski's laptop contained more than 100,000 files with pornographic images and videos.

Wesolowski was the highest-ranking Catholic official arrested for alleged sexual abuse of minors. He died in 2015, before he could be put on trial.

The Netherlands, 2011

Thousands of children suffered from sexual abuse in the Dutch Roman Catholic Church over more than six decades, and about 800 "possible perpetrators" have been identified, according to an independent Commission of Inquiry, issued in 2011.

The commission said it received 1,795 reports of church-related sex abuse of minors and the "reports contained information about possible perpetrators."

JUST WATCHED Pope Benedict and the sex abuse scandal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pope Benedict and the sex abuse scandal 02:30

Allegations of sexual abuse spread across a half dozen countries -- including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Brazil, home of the world's largest Catholic population.

Revelations about church abuse included the Munich, Germany, archdiocese where Pope Benedict XVI once served as archbishop.

Under the Pope's tenure as archbishop in the early 1980s, the Munich archdiocese ignored warnings to keep a molesting priest away from children, said the doctor, Werner Huth, who issued those warnings.

Huth demanded the priest, Rev. Peter Hullermann, never be allowed to interact with children again. Instead, the church allowed the priest to return to work and to deal with children. Hullermann was convicted of abusing minors in 1986. Pope Benedict had left the Munich archdiocese for a new post in 1982.

Ireland, 2009

A bombshell report commissioned by the Irish government concluded that the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up clerical child abuse.

The Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation's 720-page report said that it has "no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up" from January 1975 to May 2004, the time covered by the report. The commission had been set up in 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the Irish capital.

The report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children. Of the other 35, it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two.

USA, 2004

Children accused more than 4,000 priests of sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002, according to a report compiled by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

The report, based on church records, found that 6,700 of the 11,000 allegations were investigated and substantiated, and another 1,000 were unsubstantiated. The remaining 3,300 were not investigated because the priests involved had died by the time the allegation was made.

USA, 2002

Former priest John Geoghan became a central figure in the clergy sexual abuse crisis in Boston, along with Cardinal Bernard Law, who admitted receiving a letter in 1984 outlining allegations of child molestation against Geoghan. Law assigned Geoghan to another parish despite the allegations.

From 1962 to 1995, Geoghan sexually abused approximately 130 people, mostly grammar school boys, according to victims. Over the years, church officials ordered him to get treatment or transferred him to other parishes, but kept him on as a priest. The Boston Globe coverage on sexual abuse by clergy brought the issue to the forefront. The story was later adapted into the award-winning movie "Spotlight."

Geoghan was found guilty of molesting a boy in a swimming pool and sentenced to prison in 2002. A year later, he died after an attack by another inmate at the state prison.

Law resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002.

In 2004, Archbishop Sean O'Malley issued a statement saying that 815 people had made claims of sex abuse of a minor by a priest and 150 people had made claims against a deacon, non-incardinated, or religious order priest between 1950 and 2003.

In 2011, O'Malley published the names of 159 clerics accused of sexual assault over that time period. The names of an additional 91 clerics who had been accused were not included for reasons including their deaths before the completion of inquiries when they had not been publicly accused.

Austria, 1998

Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër of Vienna was forced to give up all his duties amid allegations he molested young boys. A statement by Groer asked for forgiveness but made no admission of guilt, reported the BBC.

USA, 1985

Father Thomas Doyle warned of sexual abuse by clergy in a report given at the US conference of bishops. It was ignored.
__label__politics (CNN) A parting lesson in American civility from Sen. John McCain lies in the roster of leaders he personally selected to pay tribute at his memorial service Saturday at the National Cathedral.

It was a day in early April when Barack Obama received an unexpected call from McCain, who was battling brain cancer and said he had a blunt question to ask: Would you deliver one of the eulogies at my funeral?

Obama, who is responsible for extinguishing McCain's second bid for the White House a decade ago, immediately answered that he would. He was taken aback by the request, aides say, as was George W. Bush, another former rival, who received a similar call from McCain this spring.

When the 43rd and 44th US presidents stand on the high altar of the soaring cathedral on Saturday, after the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" anthem is sung, they will not only be celebrating the life of John Sidney McCain III. It will be McCain, too, having a not-so-subtle last word, aimed at another president he made clear he did not want to attend: Donald J. Trump.

While neither of the two former presidents were especially close to McCain in life, he and Bush were fellow Republicans, forged together for better or worse, through policy and party loyalty. After a deeply personal and vitriolic primary fight in 2000, McCain went on to endorse Bush and occasionally campaigned with him four years later.

But McCain's decision to invite Obama to speak at his funeral stands out as far more extraordinary, given their brutal and bitter rivalry during the 2008 presidential race.

I had a daily ringside seat to their feud, covering the campaign for The New York Times, chronicling their fights over the Iraq war and, later, the economy. On those subjects, and many more, McCain viewed Obama as naïve and unprepared for the presidency. To be clear, those critiques lingered long after Obama won, particularly on matters of national security.

So, I've been wondering whether McCain and Obama had somehow developed an intimate relationship after Obama left office, if they had been having quiet conversations over the last year or two that haven't been publicly discussed as McCain neared the end of his journey.

It turns out, after talking to several friends of both men this week, their relationship isn't intimate at all, but rather one rooted in mutual respect and a shared sense of alarm at today's caustic political climate. Their telephone call on that April day was first arranged by advisers, not McCain simply dialing up Obama as he would do with his legion of friends, a sign they were hardly tight.

In fact, the two have spoken by phone only a couple of times since Obama left the White House, aides to both men say, most notably last summer when Obama reached out after McCain cast the deciding vote to salvage the Affordable Care Act. He thanked him. The call was brief.

Obama has not been among the long parade of visitors who came to see McCain on his Arizona ranch as he fought brain cancer. George and Laura Bush dropped by not long ago, as did former Vice President Joe Biden, a close and longtime friend of McCain's in the Senate, who will deliver a eulogy at a memorial service on Thursday in Arizona.

But McCain's decision to ask Obama and Bush to eulogize him is part of a carefully choreographed -- and, yes, even strategic -- message for America and the world in the wake of his death. It's also perhaps, one last opportunity for McCain to try and tamp down a fervor that first awoke in the Republican Party during his 2008 race and has swelled ever since.

'A lesson in civility'

Steve Duprey, a longtime friend of McCain's and a senior adviser in his 2008 campaign, said the senator respected Obama, even if the two were never particularly close and wounds from their race were raw for years.

"I think it is John McCain imparting a lesson in civility by asking the two men who defeated him to speak, as an example to America that differences in political views and contests shouldn't be so important that we lose our common bonds and the civility that is, or used to be, a hallmark of American democracy," Duprey said.

David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Obama in his campaigns and in the White House, said the clear message McCain is sending is "about our shared heritage, our shared trust of this democracy that transcends party and transcends tribe."

"It really does animate his message of national unity," Axelrod said. "There is a kind of poetry to it that he wanted his two erstwhile opponents to eulogize them."

Even unspoken, the lesson also shines a light on McCain's outward disdain for Trump and his presidency. And McCain hardly shied away from that in a farewell, posthumous message released on Monday in which he echoed his concession speech to Obama from a decade ago.

"Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here," McCain wrote in the statement released after his death. "Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history."

But as the remarkable story of McCain's life has been replaying this week -- his acts of wartime heroism and his admissions of congressional mistakes -- it's striking the degree to which the old quarrels seem almost charming in the era of Trump.

Burying the hatchet

Not mincing words, as McCain rarely did, one of his friends explained it like this: Trump has made it far easier for McCain to bury the hatchet with Bush and Obama.

It was Obama, in particular, who got under McCain's skin long before they faced off in the general election of the 2008 campaign. Their first skirmish happened two years earlier in the halls of the Senate, where McCain blasted Obama for "posturing" on one of his favorite issues: lobbying reform.

"I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party's effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman senator, and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness," McCain wrote in a searing and sarcastic letter to Obama

I was thinking back to that clash this week, which ended three days later as McCain and Obama playfully cocked their fists and mugged for the cameras on Capitol Hill.

Those early dust-ups, of course, grew into full-blown fights on the campaign trail, when McCain aired his long-held observation that Obama was full of himself.

"I don't seek the presidency on the presumption that I am blessed with such personal greatness," McCain said one day in the early stages of their race . "That history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need."

What annoyed McCain the most, of course, was how Obama was steadily capturing the mantle of change and the air of excitement that he once enjoyed aboard his famous campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express.

I was lucky enough to see that for myself when I first met McCain in the fall of 1999, as he was becoming the rising candidate in the Republican primary. At the time, I was a cub reporter for the Des Moines Register. Since McCain's strategy was to skip the Iowa caucuses -- a very wise decision -- I went to find him in New Hampshire and was overwhelmed by his charm.

Charm turned cantankerous

By the 2008 campaign, after I had interviewed McCain many times while covering Congress for the Chicago Tribune and The New York Times, his charm turned cantankerous. McCain snapped at me one day as he returned to Washington to cast a vote, curtly suggesting reporters were treating Obama with kid gloves. He often refused to speak to journalists, but he always had a hard time keeping the punishment up for long because he did like talking -- and promoting -- issues that mattered.

It was Obama, ironically, who was far more reticent around the press. He initially confided to advisers that he was worried about running against such an authentic figure and war hero like McCain, but quickly found a way to agitate his opponent: tying him to Bush.

He did so again and again as they tangled in televised debates during the fall of 2008 in Mississippi, Tennessee and New York and in campaign rallies in all corners of the country.

"I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common," Obama said in a frequent refrain. "Here's the thing, we know what the Bush-McCain philosophy looks like."

All of that, of course, is ancient -- and quaint -- history. Yet it will be front-and-center on Saturday as Bush and Obama, an improbable duo, rise to send off McCain, a rival no more.
__label__world (CNN) After racing a yacht from London to Rio de Janeiro, adventurer Dhruv Boruah learned that another team taking part in that same race had come across two turtles tangled in plastic in the middle the Atlantic Ocean. Thinking about all the other victims of plastic pollution in our oceans, Boruah was compelled to act.

So, back home in London, he pieced together a bamboo bicycle, put yellow floats on either side, and added a rudder and a pedal-powered propeller to the front. Then, with a fishing net hooked on either side, he began cycling on the city's rivers and canals collecting plastic waste.

The idea is not to singlehandedly rid London's waterways of plastic — that's too big a job for one man on a floating bicycle.

Instead, Boruah, 35, uses his comical contraption to strike up conversations with curious onlookers.

"It's a great conversation starter, and then I can tell them about my work, the plastic, and how it all starts here in the canals," Boruah tells CNN while balancing on his bike in London's Regent's Canal.

__label__world (CNN) A taxi bus full of taxi drivers was bombarded with bullets Saturday night, with gunmen killing at least 11 people who were heading back from a funeral, South African police said.

Authorities believe the 11 victims were among 17 people leaving a funeral in Gauteng province to return to Johannesburg, the South African Police Service said.

The attack happened between the towns of Colenso and Weenen when an unknown number of gunmen jumped onto the road from the bushes and opened fire on the vehicle, authorities said.

Authorities aren't sure what motivated the attack on taxi drivers.

Of the six people on the bus who survived, four were critically wounded, and two were not injured.

Police said neither the motive for the attack nor the identities of the assailants are known.

__label__politics (CNN) On this one thing there is agreement: America is under attack.

On everything else, Steve Bannon and John Brennan, both of whom issued over-the-top call to arms on the same day, fly in extremely opposite directions.

They both issued dire contradictory warnings about the future of the country on the same day: Brennan arguing that Russians have interfered with the US and were helped by the Trump campaign, and Bannon released a heart-pounding movie trailer that argues the media is bent on bringing Trump down -- and the November election is the only chance to save his presidency.

It's hard to believe the two men are talking about the same President.

Brennan is the former CIA director and current presidential critic stripped by President Donald Trump of his security clearance. Brennan's is the top name on what The Washington Post aptly described as an "enemies list" of current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials being reviewed by the administration.

__label__politics (CNN) The death of Arizona Sen. John McCain has occasioned a number of heartfelt tributes as the nation pays homage to a man who sacrificed much for this country. But how will McCain be remembered in the Senate, the place where he spent the final 30+ years of his life? And how do his legislative accomplishments rank against the list of our greatest senators?

I put those questions -- and more -- to Ross Baker , professor of political science at Rutgers University and someone who has spent considerable time in the Senate as a senior adviser to both Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.).

Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.

Cillizza: Let's start with a simple word association: When you think of "Sen. John McCain," what words jump to mind -- and why?

Baker: Irascible but lovable. A keen mind and a hot temper. And a junk food addict.
__label__politics (CNN) Sen. John McCain's heroism and code of honor, duty and unifying pragmatism will endure as a powerful historical example . But his political legacy met its match in President Donald Trump, who has prevailed in their struggle for the current soul of the GOP.

As the 2008 Republican presidential nominee leaves the stage, the trajectory of his party is ever more aligned with the worldview and combative attitudes of Trump, who electrified the party's activist base in a way McCain could never manage.

There is no sign that grass-roots conservatives are about to return to the loftier, more traditional views embodied by McCain -- even as he is being lauded in the political world as a paragon of self-sacrifice and patriotic service. It's quite clear that the GOP base prefers Trump's scorched earth politics and attacks on political institutions and traditions that McCain revered.

In primary races across the country, including in McCain's Arizona, which goes to the polls on Tuesday, GOP candidates have been replicating the President's style and insurgent narratives, forcing more moderate candidates to tack to the right to keep their campaigns alive.

Their behavior reflects the reality that Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016 largely because he was so unlike the Arizona senator and other more temperate Republicans, such as Florida's Sen. Marco Rubio, or establishment scions such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

In one final appeal, McCain delivered a last jab at Trump's America First ideology, which has usurped his Ronald Reagan-style internationalism, in a farewell message read out by his former campaign manager Rick Davis on Monday.

"We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe," McCain told his fellow Americans

"We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been."

McCain did not directly mention Trump but everyone knew what he meant.

Trump finally finds the words

JUST WATCHED Trump finally speaks about John McCain Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump finally speaks about John McCain 01:36

The depth of the antipathy between McCain and Trump played out as Washington got back to work for the first time since the passing of one of its most high-profile statesmen.

Three times on Monday, Trump crossed his arms, set his jaw and simply ignored questions from reporters about McCain's legacy, following his failure to issue even a written statement paying tribute to his foe, the very least that would be expected of a President.

It was a reminder that Trump shows few signs that he views the presidency as a national trust that sometimes must take priority over his own immediate political interests.

He ordered flags to half-staff on government buildings until McCain's burial on Sunday, after the Stars and Stripes at the White House was earlier returned to the top of its pole in a move that sparked a backlash in Washington.

Then, in remarks to evangelical leaders, the President said that "we very much appreciate everything Sen. McCain has done for our country."

Farewell to McCain's brand

But if McCain's camp can claim a final moral victory for the senator over the President, it's also clear that Washington is not just mourning a statesman, it is also saying farewell to his brand of politics.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a moving address, praising McCain as a national hero "integral to the United States Senate."

But he did not mention the great legislative campaigns that McCain will be most remembered for, including his bipartisan pushes on immigration and campaign finance legislation or his crusade to ban the torture of terror suspects.

That's because the Republican Party, with its march to the right, has largely rejected such policies.

In other areas, including his support for free trade, his revulsion for Russian President Vladimir Putin and global strongmen, his vehement support for the Atlantic alliance and human rights, McCain found himself at odds with a President who has an iron grip on his party.

Even in his affection for the press, the Arizona senator enraged Trump voters.

McCain's increasingly outspoken attacks on the President in the final months of his life cemented his decline among the party's grass roots.

In a CNN/ORC poll in October 2013, 56% of Republicans said they had favorable opinions of McCain, compared with 45% of Democrats.

By this June, a CNN/SSRS survey found the situation reversed, with only 33% of GOP voters approving of McCain, compared with 67% of Democrats. Only 32% of those who approved of Trump also liked McCain.

At the same time, there is no doubting Trump's hold on the GOP of 2018. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday put his approval rating among Republicans at 90%.

That data explains why Trump's insulting behavior toward McCain, though drawing disgust in Washington, is unlikely to exert a political price. It's a lesson Trump intuited in 2015 when he said the Vietnam War veteran was not a hero because he had been captured.

It's also a reason why the President's absence from McCain's memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral on Saturday -- at the request of the senator's family -- might be a personal humiliation, but will contain a certain amount of political vindication.

After all, being shunned by the biggest gathering in months of Washington elites plays directly into Trump's insurgent narrative.

Many grass-roots Republicans have long been suspicious of McCain, whose ideological unorthodoxy grated on some conservatives as far back as his 2000 presidential primary race against George W. Bush. In 2008, there was a noticeable enthusiasm gap among Republicans who attended riotous rallies by his running mate, Sarah Palin, and staid events featuring the GOP nominee himself.

In retrospect, his selection of Palin was a first warning sign of the tea party revolt that would rock the GOP several years later, which led to a full-scale Trump revolution and has culminated in the eclipse of more moderate conservatives in the party such as McCain, his fellow Arizonan Sen. Jeff Flake and Tennessee's Sen. Bob Corker, all of whom will be gone when the new Congress convenes next year.

'Savaging' Trump

The conservative media offers a reminder that while McCain was adored in Washington, by his colleagues and the reporters who covered him, the outpouring of grief at his passing is not necessarily shared by Republicans in the heartland.

Many conservatives see such coverage as just another opportunity for the media to condemn Trump by implication.

"One of the reasons there's reverence for McCain is the opportunity it provides to continue to savage Donald Trump, to continue to rip Donald Trump by setting up these comparisons between Trump and McCain and showing Trump coming up short on virtually every measure the drive-bys (mainstream reporters) make," Rush Limbaugh said Monday on his radio show.

If there is a lesson McCain wanted to send at the end, it is that the GOP under Trump has taken a turn away from fundamental American values.

"We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement," he wrote in his farewell message.

But many conservatives in the early 21st century -- suspicious of establishment institutions and mainstream political leaders -- simply do not see the world that way.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. James Inhofe told reporters Monday that Sen. John McCain was "partially to blame" for the controversy over the lowering of the White House flag.

Inhofe, a senior member of Senate Armed Services Committee, was highly complimentary of McCain but when asked about the flag flap he attributed it to the late senator's public spat with President Donald Trump in recent years. He described both men as "strong willed people."

"Well, you know, frankly, I think that John McCain is partially to blame for that because he is very outspoken. He disagreed with the President in certain areas and wasn't too courteous about it," Inhofe said.

On Saturday evening, the White House flag had been positioned at half-staff to mark the death of McCain, the former Vietnam prisoner of war and onetime Republican presidential nominee. But just after midnight on Sunday night, the flag flying above the White House was hoisted back to full staff.

Then on Monday afternoon, the White House once again lowered the flag to half-staff and Trump, in a statement, said he "signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment."

__label__world (CNN) The so-called "scallop wars" appear to have ended peacefully. Following confrontations between British and French fishermen last week, the two countries announced a compromise Wednesday: British vessels will stay out of French waters in exchange for compensation.

Industry representatives met in London after five British boats, outnumbered by an estimated 35 French vessels, were chased from France's scallop-rich Baie de la Seine. The incident took place 12 nautical miles off the Normandy coast.

Video of the incident broadcast by France 3 Normandie showed smoke bombs and rocks being thrown at British crews, while a number of boats appeared to be rammed.

The French are restricted to a harvesting season running from October 1 to May 15, and accused their British counterparts, who are allowed to fish throughout the year, of unfair competition.

Representatives from the British and French fishing industries decided to renew the agreement that had been in place in previous years, involving vessels 15 meters long and over. They also agreed in principle for UK vessels under 15 meters to be included in the deal, subject to the compensation package.

__label__world (CNN) Australian filmmaker James Ricketson has been sentenced to six years in a Cambodian prison, after being found guilty of spying for an unnamed country.

The 69-year-old filmmaker was arrested in Cambodia in June 2017 after flying a drone over a rally organized by the Cambodia National Rescue Party, an opposition group that was later dissolved by the government.

A statement released by Ricketson's family Friday said they were "absolutely devastated" by the verdict and sentence.

"We are in utter shock at this outcome and that James, an innocent Australian, has been sentenced so harshly. Our family lives this tragedy daily," his family said.

Ricketson's lawyer Sam Onn Kong told CNN that Ricketson would seek a royal pardon, which could take up to a month to be decided.

Meanwhile his family urged the Australian government to intervene, saying that Ricketson's health had suffered during the 15 months he's spent in Prey Sar prison, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.

"James is almost 70 and is not in good health, our family is very scared about what will happen to him in there if things take a turn for the worst," they said in the statement.

"We're not sure how long he can endure the conditions he is forced to live in in Prey Sar prison, where he is subject to cramped quarters, lack of sleep, subsistence food and close to zero medical care."

James Ricketson was accused of endangering national security by flying a drone over an opposition party rally last year.

The Australian government said it acknowledged the conviction and was providing full consular assistance.

"Mr Ricketson is subject to legal proceedings under Cambodian law and must now consider his response to the court's decision using the avenues open to him under Cambodian law," said the statement from Foreign Affairs minister Marise Payne.

"The Australian Government will consider what further appropriate support we can provide after that time."

HRW: 'Ridiculously excessive charges'

Before the verdict was announced Friday, Kong said that the prosecution had failed to provide any concrete evidence of espionage -- or even name the country that he was accused of spying for.

"Which words, which sentences, which paragraphs effect national defense?" Kong asked the prosecutor at Ricketson's trial, according to Australia's national broadcaster ABC.

"Which country is James spying for? Is it Australia? Is it America? Please let us know."

Advocacy group Human Rights Watch condemned the Cambodian judicial system in a statement following the verdict Friday.

"This trial exposed everything that's wrong with the Cambodian judicial system: ridiculously excessive charges, prosecutors with little or no evidence, and judges carrying out political orders from the government rather than ruling based on what happens in court," Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director, Human Rights Watch said.

"When it comes to a conviction in a Cambodian court, clearly no facts are required."

CNN has attempted to contact the Cambodian government for comment but hasn't received a response.

The Australian Directors' Guild (ADG) called on the Australian government to intervene on Ricketson's behalf.

"We call on the new foreign minister, Marise Payne, to contact her counterpart in Cambodia and seek clemency for James and for him to be sent home" ADG CEO Kingston Anderson said in a statement.

"Based on the evidence and what we know of James we do not believe he was spying for anyone. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time and may have contravened some local regulations but he was not spying for any government.

The Australian government has not commented.

Veteran filmmaker

Ricketson has traveled back and forth between Cambodia and Australia for more than 20 years, filming documentaries about life in the Southeast Asian country.

His son, Jesse Ricketson told CNN that his father's first trip to Cambodia was to film "Sleeping with Cambodia," a 55-minute documentary described by Screen Australia as an "exploration of paedophilia and children at risk."

Since then he has set up charitable ventures in the country, including fostering a Cambodian girl, and her mother.

The ABC reports that Ricketson had been critical of Cambodian leader Hun Sen, and that Cambodian media sympathetic to the government had labeled him an "important spy" acting to foment a "color revolution."

The prosecution's main legal arguments focused on emails, which were retrieved after his arrest, including one message to former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, urging him to withdraw an invitation for Hun Sen to visit Australia in 2016, Kong said.

Ricketson said in his closing statements at the trial that the "notion that a spy would provide national security information to a prime minister via a Gmail account is both fanciful and ludicrous," according to the ABC.

Ricketson's son Jesse told CNN Thursday that months of detention in a Cambodian prison had taken a toll on his father's physical and mental health.

"(It's been) hard for us, most specifically James. He's an old man and not in the best health -- conditions in prison are very hard. There's also a human toll on all those who support him."

He said his father had never meant to offend the Cambodian people or government.

"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father," Cruz said at a morning meeting where he faced sharp questions from the Texas delegation in Cleveland.

Cruz stood by his decision in a remarkable 25-minute back-and-forth with his own constituents, defying appeals from his own Texas delegation to put the party above his inhibitions and back Trump.

Cruz sensationally withheld an endorsement of Trump in his speech Wednesday, earning a chorus of boos from the floor while getting upstaged in a power play by the GOP nominee himself.

In a dramatic development, as Cruz wrapped up his speech, Trump suddenly appeared in the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. He walked to join his family in a VIP area and flashed a thumbs-up -- a gesture that transmitted clear anger at the Texas senator's behavior.

Cruz, his party's runner-up, uttered Trump's name just once -- to congratulate him -- and instead pitched the ideological brand of conservatism that endears him to the GOP's base.

"I congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night," Cruz said. "And like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November."

But as it was clear Cruz was going to end his speech without endorsing Trump, delegates began to boo and some chanted "We want Trump!"

"Don't stay home in November," Cruz said toward the end of his otherwise very well-received speech. "Stand and speak and vote your conscience."

As delegates began to protest, Sen. Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, was heckled by Trump supporters shouting "Goldman Sachs!" and escorted out by security. Heidi Cruz, who is an employee of Goldman Sachs, declined to answer questions from reporters, saying, "I don't talk to the media, thanks."

The stunning political theater between the top two contenders in the Republican primary race blew open divisions in the party that the convention is designed to heal, and suggested Cruz believes Trump will lose in November.

Cruz's appearance at the Cleveland convention had been the subject of intense anticipation over his attitude toward Trump, after their intensely personal exchanges in the late stages of the primary race.

He got a prolonged standing ovation as he walked on stage for a speech that appeared to be an attempt to establish himself as the guardian of conservative values that some activists doubt Trump shares.

Blocked from Adelson suite

Cruz's rebuke ignited a hot scene around the senator as soon as he left the stage. People averted their eyes from Cruz and his wife as they walked with their security detail on the skybox level of boisterous Republicans.

On the donor suite level, people approached Cruz and insulted him, a source told CNN's Dana Bash. One state party chair reacted so angrily that they had to be restrained.

Cruz, who has long sought the support of GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson, was turned away when he tried to enter Adelson's suite.

Andy Abboud, a senior aide to the Las Vegas casino magnate, said Cruz was initially invited to come up to visit the Adelsons, but when he failed to endorse Trump the invitation was rescinded.

"When he didn't endorse, they were stunned and disappointed," Abboud told CNN.

"We could not allow Ted Cruz to use the Adelsons as a prop against Donald Trump," he added. "The Adelsons support Donald Trump and made that clear. They like Ted Cruz, but there was no way the Adelsons were going to be the first stop after not endorsing. That would be disrespectful to our nominee."

Trump did stop by the suite, and Abboud tweeted out a picture of Trump with Sheldon and Dr. Miriam Adelson.

Trump, whose insults of Cruz were a constant on the campaign trail over the past year, tweeted that Cruz didn't honor the pledge GOP candidates had signed to back the eventual Republican nominee.

"Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!"

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- a former presidential candidate and now a Trump backer -- blasted Cruz's speech in an interview with Bash.

"I think it was awful," Christie said. "And quite frankly, I think it was something selfish. And he signed a pledge. And it's his job to keep his word."

Trump lawyer Michael Cohen said on CNN that "the only way to describe it is political suicide."

A source close to Cruz said the senator wasn't shocked by the mood after the speech.

"He expected people to not approve," the source said. "Not surprised at the reaction."

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who accepted the nomination as Trump's vice presidential nominee at the end of Wednesday's session, sidestepped when asked about Cruz's speech.

"I am just grateful for all the support we are receiving and I am excited about the future," Pence said.

Eric Trump's reaction: "The audience didn't seem to like it right?"

Asked about the impact of the non-endorsement, Eric Trump responded, "I don't think it makes any difference in the world."

Hillary Clinton's campaign seized on Cruz's speech as well, tweeting: "Vote your conscience" with a link to her website.

Delegates unhappy as well: 'He failed the nation'

The reaction from the floor was also swift and harsh.

Newt Gingrich, appearing after Cruz, argued that Cruz's advocacy for constitutionalism meant that he, implicitly, endorsed Trump -- words he himself did not say.

"So to paraphrase Ted Cruz, if you want to protect the Constitution this fall, there's only one possible way and that's to vote the Trump-Pence ticket."

Richard Black, a delegate from Virginia who chaired Cruz's campaign, said after Cruz's speech that it was "doubtful" he would support him again.

"In the end, each individual has a duty to the nation that transcends the duty to themselves,' Black said. "That's where he failed... He failed the nation."

Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona, who backed Cruz, told CNN he was "disappointed" by Cruz' speech.

On him saying "vote your conscience", Franks said, "for the people in this room, a vote of conscience is a Trump vote."

Michigan GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga, a former Marco Rubio supporter, called Cruz' speech "a mistake."

Huizenga said it was also a mistake for the Trump campaign to give Cruz a coveted prime-time speaking slot without some type of "pre-condition" that he would formally endorse Trump.

Jonathan Barnett, a Republican national committeeman from Arkansas, walked off the floor after Cruz's speech.

"He's self-centered. It's all about Ted Cruz. All he did is ruin his political career," Barnett said. "I think he's finished."

Barnett said this is not the kind of grace one shows their party's nominee: "Reagan wouldn't have done that. He endorsed Ford."

Arizona delegate Bruce Ash expressed a similar sentiment.

"Cruz missed his moment. All he had to do was say 'Trump' and he used the dog whistle for 'conscience.' A very disappointing message," Ash texted.

Cruz's difficult challenge

The speech was difficult from the start: Cruz's goal was to walk a tightrope and keep alive his political viability for 2020 without alienating Trump's legion of supporters.

It was the latter that tripped him up.

Cruz came to the dais facing significant pressure to endorse Trump from his campaign aides and surrogates. Yet he is still at a moment of power and relevance: Only 45, a Latino senator who ended his campaign holding onto more political capital than he has ever enjoyed in his career.

His challenge was to remain well-liked in a GOP that, at least for now, is under the control of a man Cruz has indicated that he does not respect. Cruz effectively placed a risky bet that the Republican Party will judge Trump harshly and reward him in the new era for not caving.

"If skillfully played, his stock will rise," Randall Dunning, a Texas delegate who has misgivings about Trump, said the day before he spoke.

Wes Brumit, a Cruz delegate from Texas, defended Cruz's non-endorsement Wednesday night.

"He did mention all the points Trump mentioned: building a wall, fighting ISIS. He just didn't come right out and endorse," said Bumit, who sported a red "Ted Cruz for President" T-shirt and a cowboy hat. "He said everyone should be able to vote their conscience. And that's OK with me."

As for those who loudly booed Cruz? "All the boos were exactly the New York values that Ted has talked about."

Bumit added: "I think Mr. Trump has some things to apologize for to Cruz before Sen Cruz can come onboard fully for Trump."

But the question now is how skillful Cruz played it. If Trump loses narrowly, holdouts like Cruz could be held responsible in 2020 for not unifying the party. And it is clear there are Trump loyalists who now say they are loathe to back him.

Cruz and Trump, once political allies, turned on one another as they became the top two Republicans in the race. And their tension exploded when Trump's associates fanned flames of salacious tabloid rumors about Cruz and later attacked Cruz's father.

Since withdrawing from the race, Cruz has repeatedly declined to endorse Trump, but maintained that he could always come around to backing the Republican nominee. Yet their past tension -- and the personal attacks -- cast a cloud over any accord between the two aspirants.

Cruz's chief strategist Jason Johnson tweeted: "Since it's obvious the shock is contrived, let me ask: What the Hell did they expect from the son of the man who killed JFK? Light'n up."

Former Cruz aide Brian Phillips also defended the senator: "Just more proof this is about submission. We were told for months Trump didn't need Cruz, but when he doesn't endorse they go apoplectic."

The remarkable moment at the convention was the second time Cruz was upstaged by Trump Wednesday.

At a rally on the Cleveland waterfront, as Cruz spoke gingerly to fellow Republicans about "our nominee" and the uncertain future under his former rival, Trump's plane flew in the clear skies behind him.

"That was pretty well orchestrated" Cruz said as the Trump-emblazoned aircraft buzzed through the air and the crowd booed.

Turning to his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, Cruz said, "Jeff, did you email them to fly the plane right when I said that?"
__label__world (CNN) After years of militant and military control, the Somali national stadium in Mogadishu will return to a place for sports.

The stadium had been occupied by the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab before it was taken over by troops from the African Union's peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in 2011.

AMISOM forces have used the stadium as an operating base ever since.

At a handover ceremony on Tuesday, AMISOM and Somali officials toured the war-torn stadium and invited the nation's youth to come and play.

Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily, my presidential weekly briefing focuses on the topics and issues the President needs to know to make informed decisions.

Here's this week's briefing:

NAFTA next steps: King of the North

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau probably doesn't want to be the odd man out in any revised North American Free Trade Agreement. We assess he is likely motivated to make a deal with you, even if it means making some sensitive concessions because he wants to avoid the costs of you reimposing pre-NAFTA era tariffs on Canada in addition to new tariffs you are threatening on Canadian cars. He probably believes getting shut out of a deal would thereby outweigh costs associated with showing some flexibility in NAFTA negotiations.

Trudeau probably thinks that you are open to negotiating with Canada despite your leaked comments to the contrary and tweet this weekend saying, "There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal." He knows that you have historically espoused maximalist positions as part of your negotiating strategy -- including in negotiations with Mexico when you initially insisted that Mexico pay for a border wall and with the European Commission over their trade barriers -- which eventually gave way to trade war truces and agreements.

Trudeau may continue to discount your statements as political posturing for your base, but we assess there is an inflection point. He has previously called your steel and aluminum tariff unacceptable and said that he'll stand up for Canadian workers, a sentiment echoed by Canadian Chrystia Foreign Minister Freeland on Friday. Ongoing vitriol against Canada will eventually lead to a reaction by Trudeau that would, in turn, feed a war of words alongside the current trade war. Lowering the public volume on negotiations will increase the probability that the Canadians will feel like they have more space to show flexibility.

Even though US and Canadian negotiators didn't reach an agreement by your original August 31 deadline , US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's willingness to extend talks into next week was likely seen as a signal you are more flexible than you originally stated. Because of this, the Canadians probably think you are willing to soften your red lines and deadlines in other areas. They likely took note of Lighthizer's statement that the United States will sign an agreement with Mexico "and Canada if it is willing," and may have interpreted this as a US preference to maintain a three-way arrangement.

We think that Trudeau is motivated to avoid getting essentially kicked out of a new US-Mexico NAFTA agreement. Exclusion would likely mean, the reimposition of any tariffs NAFTA originally lifted ( trade between the United States and Canada is up 169% since NAFTA was signed and then any new tariffs you chose to impose as punishment for Canada's failure to meet your negotiating requirements successfully. Trudeau already knows you're not worried about using tariffs as punishment when you feel like it, so he probably believes your threat about putting tariffs on Canadian cars (Canadian vehicle exports to the United States totaled $56 billion in 2017, the second-largest Canadian export to the US) if you don't reach a revised NAFTA agreement. He doesn't think you're bluffing.

The Canadians probably think your primary focus is on greater access for US companies to the Canadian dairy market based on your public comments. Expect the Canadian team to up your negotiators eventually by giving you a victory in this sector in exchange for some kind of win for Trudeau on protecting Canadian publishing and broadcasting industries and maintaining some kind of NAFTA dispute resolution mechanism.

Syria: Assad 'liquidation' announcement

We expect a massive operation from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime -- backed by Russia -- any day in the Syrian province of Idlib, one of the supposed Syrian de-escalation zones where Assad agreed not to fight. We do not assess that Assad is deterred from instigating this attack or from using chemical weapons as part of his offensive. Assad and his Russian backers are forecasting their plans because they do not think that you will actively try to stop them and instead think you will rely on diplomatic entreaties. We have advance warning of an impending atrocity.

Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke publicly about the need to move against terrorists in Idlib (the Syrian regime and the Russian government share a penchant for labeling anyone they don't like a terrorist) and said that the situation is a "festering abscess that needs to be liquidated." Assad is motivated to assault Idlib -- not just because there are terrorist groups active there, but because it is the last stronghold held by rebels. Assad wants all Syrian territory under his control.

It is highly likely that Assad will move against Idlib because he does not fear the consequences of doing so. Assad and his Russian backers know that US troops are currently authorized to fight ISIS, not to fight the regime, which further diminishes the chances that Western soldiers will ward off any Assad offensive.

The Russians also probably assess that you do not want to engage directly with forces backed by Russia because that could risk a serious escalation between US and Russian assets on the ground at a time when you are weighing a withdrawal from Syria and trying to repair relations with President Vladimir Putin.

They are playing off the growing rift between the United States and Turkey and have said that when it comes to Idlib there was a "full political understanding" between Moscow and Ankara. The Russians are probably intentionally implying that Turkey has acquiesced to whatever Moscow has proposed. This would be a departure from Turkey's previous position, which included working with us to support elements of the opposition and the administration of the supposedly nonviolent de-escalation zone of Idlib.

We are seeing Russia make military moves that we think are a prelude to another Assad chemical weapons attack. Russia has deployed significant military assets to the eastern Mediterranean, including 26 warships (some armed with cruise missiles) and combat aircraft. The Russians are saying these assets will be part of military exercises in the area, but we assess they are being pre-positioned to counter US missile strikes against Assad if he uses chemical weapons.

Their air defense systems weren't very successful against the last US missile attack in April (after an Assad chemical weapons attack). These additional assets could help counter what the Russians and Syrians likely consider anticipated US strikes because they know the regime is planning to use chemical weapons and that you will likely respond.

Another worrying signal is the Russian misinformation campaign already underway on the yet-to-be initiated chemical weapons attack. After previous Assad attacks, the regime and the Russians have spread misinformation, blaming opposition forces and even humanitarian groups such as the White Helmets

This time, they're spreading misinformation in advance; Lavrov has already stated that the White Helmets are preparing to stage another chemical weapons attack that the group could blame on the Syrian government as a pretext for more US military action.

We interpret this as Russia trying to shape the narrative about impending Syrian chemical weapons use before it happens. They know that you have struck Syrian targets after previous chemical weapons use and probably think that if they even somewhat convincingly cast blame on others you may think twice about hitting the regime.

Indian summer: 2+2 dialogue this week

As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis prepare to travel to India for the maiden 2+2 dialogue with their Indian counterparts, we assess that the government of India views this dialogue as an important signal that you prioritize our relationship with India. This trip could help offset the news that you aren't traveling to a series of summits in Asia this fall, which some of your peers may interpret as you placing less emphasis on your relationships there.

The secretaries' trip comes at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is under pressure after a defeat in the last round of by-elections for Parliament and state assemblies . Modi is up for re-election in 2019. His campaign will be buttressed by some economic head winds -- Indian economic growth is accelerating, but inflation is a concern and the currency is falling . More economic reforms are expected, and the Modi administration will likely want to capitalize on the 2+2 dialogue goodwill to preclude any US sanctions, pressure from tariffs or other downside economic risks emanating from Washington.

Indian officials may thereby be focused on some near-term issues with economic implications, including whether they will get waivers for any ongoing purchases of Iranian crude oil after you reimpose these sanctions in November . Tariff relief may also be high on their dialogue agenda. India postponed its implementation of retaliatory tariffs against your steel and aluminum tariffs but is due to impose them later this month and may want to discuss a deal.

You should expect Indian officials to emphasize the growth of our bilateral trading relationship because they believe this is a priority for you. They will likely point to our bilateral trade increasing by $12 billion in 2017 alongside increased Indian purchases of crude oil from the United States with a value of about $580 million.

Middle East peace: Chain reaction

We assess that your decision to cut funding for the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees will set off, as German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said , an "uncontrollable chain reaction" that will adversely affect security in the region, the ability to negotiate a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, the well-being of the Palestinians currently receiving support from the UN agency and more.

You said last year that if countries voted against you at the United Nations "we'll save a lot," by cutting our foreign assistance to them, and you urged Congress to "pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America's friends." Ambassador Nikki Haley has publicly echoed your sentiments . Now, with your latest cut to the Palestinian refugee agency, we think it is likely that foreign aid recipients think they need to align with you on all fronts if they want to continue receiving your aid.

This could set off a chain reaction. Countries may view your actions as a new precedent -- one that essentially will be a bribe for good behavior, however that is defined by your administration, or future ones, at a particular moment in time. Countries may think that the easiest way to get money from you is to say yes when asked. This could turn foreign assistance into dirty money -- used to buy votes and more. Other countries could then justify directing their own assistance funds to those who agree with them, rather than those who are in need.
__label__politics (CNN) After one day where truth and facts triumphed, America is back to its alternative realities.

The convictions of two close associates of President Donald Trump in a mind-bending double-header drama in two cities on Tuesday were a moment of clarity in the legal morass that has thickened around the White House over the last 19 months.

Yet anyone who thought that being implicated in a crime in one of the most sensational political moments of recent history would soon temper Trump's behavior, stop his White House peddling untruths or reshape the political terrain that sustains his presidency is being disappointed -- at least for now.

Certainly, in years to come that tumultuous hour on Tuesday could turn out to be the moment when the Trump presidency began to unravel and the Teflon armor that shielded the President from scandals and outrages that would doom normal politicians was finally penetrated.

After all, months of obfuscation and attacks on Robert Mueller could not halt the legal process that's likely to send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the President's former fixer Michael Cohen to jail for years. And the real meat of the special counsel's investigation into alleged collusion with Russia is yet to be revealed.

But in the immediate term at least, it seems nothing has changed in Washington.

The White House is back to peddling narratives that defy fact, attacking the media and lifting talking points from conservative opinion hosts. Trump is making new assaults on legal propriety. Republicans are dodging reporters in the Capitol to avoid being called to account for the President's latest transgression. Democrats, owing to the GOP's power monopoly in Washington, can only stir outrage and fire blanks -- at least until the midterm elections.

'What in the world are we going through?'

Trump's defenders can still argue that although Cohen and Manafort, and the already disgraced Trump acolytes Rick Gates and Michael Flynn , have been felled by Mueller, the President has not been charged or been proved to have colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.

But his attitude on Wednesday hardly fit the profile of someone who had done nothing wrong or who is convinced the legal process should be allowed to play out to its conclusion.

He made up a legal loophole to argue that the hush money paid to women before the 2016 election who alleged they had affairs with him -- payments Cohen said were made at his direction -- did not break the law since it did not come from campaign funds.

"They didn't come out of the campaign and that's big," Trump said in an interview with Fox News. "It's not even a campaign violation."

Trump is also again brazenly tearing at the boundaries of presidential decorum, dangling the possibility of a pardon before Manafort, who might just be tempted to cooperate with Mueller, now that he's probably going to jail for most of the rest of his life.

"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!" Trump tweeted.

I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family.

Such respect for a brave man! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2018

Former Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste bemoaned the possibility that the President might be considering a pardon for a man convicted of massive tax fraud and called on political leaders to come together to head off a moment of national peril.

"What in the world are we going through in this country?" Ben-Veniste told CNN's Erica Hill.

At the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders held a previously unscheduled briefing to press home the President's counterattack.

She dismissed the notion that Trump was in legal trouble at all over Cohen's accusation, which effectively boiled down to the sitting President of the United States being accused of a crime.

"As the President has said and we've stated many times, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him and we've commented on it extensively," she said.

When asked by a reporter whether Trump's now-discredited statement on Air Force One that he knew nothing about the payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels, she attacked the messenger:

"I think that's a ridiculous accusation. The President, in this matter, has done nothing wrong."

Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are stuck in their perpetual dance, tiptoeing around Trump's latest misadventures in fear of his Make America Great Again base. House Speaker Paul Ryan, once seen as the moral conscience of the GOP, is nowhere to be seen nor heard.

"I'm not very happy about it," said Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch, who earlier this year said the current presidency could be the greatest in history, but he added Wednesday that Trump should not be blamed for his staff.

Louisiana's Sen. John Kennedy said he didn't see what the fuss was about in the Cohen and Manafort convictions.

"You know, I'm sorry. I don't see any deeper meaning in this other than you have to pay your taxes and you can't lie on a loan application," he told reporters.

South Carolina's Sen. Lindsey Graham, a sometime Trump golf partner, punted.

"Rather than answer a bunch of hypotheticals, I'll do what I did in the Clinton -- when Ken Starr issued his report. I read it, I'll make a decision," he said.

Democrats are gamely repurposing the latest Trump crisis in their almost certainly futile bid to scuttle the President's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, but are limited by their purgatory in the minority.

Hawaii's Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono nixed a meeting with Kavanaugh, to bolster Democratic calls for the nomination to be put on hold given Tuesday's events.

But Democrats are also still wary of using the "I" word, partly to avoid giving Trump a rallying issue that could motivate his supporters in the midterm elections.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told The Associated Press on Wednesday that impeachment is still "not on the table" even though some liberals believe that if Trump did conspire with Cohen in the way it appears from his court testimony, he may have already committed a high crime or misdemeanor that is the standard for House of Representatives action against a President.

A 'reckoning' will come

It's become a cliché that nothing -- insulting war hero Sen. John McCain, cozying up to Russian leader Vladimir Putin or elevating white supremacists -- derails Trump. Tuesday's events could become just another data point in that trend. And if the special counsel finds no evidence of collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, Trump will be able to credibly assert that his name is clear.

But no one knows where Mueller's probe will lead, if Trump or his campaign is guilty of collusion or obstructing justice. Presidencies can take years to unravel, as the varied experiences of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter show.

There's also little doubt that Tuesday's legal stunners, and the news that White House Counsel Donald McGahn testified to Mueller for 30 hours, have seeded new dark clouds around the President that could manifest themselves in ways impossible to predict right now.

And while Democrats are currently powerless, they could cripple Trump's presidency and make his life a misery with incessant investigations if they win the House in November

A Democratic rout would prompt Republicans to consider whether sticking with Trump and a strategy solely reliant on his base is wise in the 2020 election.

So while it may seem that Trump's political and legal luck is holding, it may erode over time and the furor surrounding Tuesday's convictions could be a major reason why.

Some Trump opponents are still optimistic that the President is set for a demise.

"I believe in the wisdom and the good faith of the American people," Norm Eisen, White House ethics czar during the Obama administration, said on CNN International.

"Let's let it unfold. He is going to meet his day of reckoning."
__label__politics (CNN) For years, many Republicans and anti-tax advocates have pushed for a change to the way that investment taxes are calculated.

They may get their wish. Steven Mnuchin told the New York Times that the administration is considering whether it can use its regulatory powers to let investors account for the effect of inflation when calculating how much their investments have grown. Treasury is evaluating the economic impact and the process through which it can be achieved, according to a Treasury spokesperson.

When investors sell stocks or other assets subject to capital gains, they are taxed on the difference between what they receive for the sale and what they paid for it originally. That tax rate is usually 20%, which is lower than the rate people are taxed on their income.

By adjusting capital gains to adjust for inflation, the White House could cut the tax bills for the nation's wealthiest investors by billions of dollars a year.

For example, if an investor bought $100,000 of stock in 1987 right after the stock market crash that year, that stock could easily be worth about $1.4 million today. The tax would be calculated on the $1.3 million gain, which would mean the investor would owe more than $250,000 in capital gains taxes if he or she sold the stock. But adjusting for inflation, a process known as indexing, the original $100,000 cost of the stock would be estimated to be more than $200,000, saving the taxpayer more than $20,000 in taxes.

__label__politics (CNN) On Tuesday night, Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley crushed 10-term Rep. Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary for a seat that has been held by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Tip O'Neill in the past.

Pressley ran as an unapologetic liberal, calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump and the abolishing of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was endorsed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the only other challenger to beat a Democratic House incumbent so far in 2018 -- and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a rising national star among liberals.

In short, Pressley's win had all the hallmarks of Ocasio-Cortez's victory over the summer -- a liberal insurgent candidate catches a more moderate, establishment member of Congress off-guard. Except that's not what happened here. At all.

Start with the fact that Capuano is no one's idea of a moderate. According to VoteView ratings , Capuano is the 15th most liberal member of Congress -- and the most liberal member of the not-very-conservative Massachusetts delegation. That makes him more liberal than Nancy Pelosi (32nd) and close to as liberal as Maxine Waters (4th). Compare that to Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democrat that Ocasio-Cortez beat. Crowley was the 78th most liberal member, according to VoteView

So if Capuano didn't lose because he wasn't liberal enough, why did he lose? Two reasons.

1. Tone

This primary didn't turn on the incumbent member of Congress voting in ways that were inconsistent with the wants and needs of his district. It was about what kind of liberalism voters in the Boston-area district wanted. Capuano's was a quiet liberalism; he always voted the right way for a district where Hillary Clinton won 83% of the vote in 2016, but he wasn't an activist. He wasn't demanding change. He wasn't storming the barricades. That was the sort of liberalism that Pressley promised. "This district and these times demand more than just an ally, they demand an advocate and a champion," she said in announcing her candidacy . "Making progress on longstanding challenges requires a different lens and a new approach."

In the wake of Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, many liberals concluded that while the former secretary of state was with them on issues, she was too tonally moderate -- unwilling to talk about things like single-payer health care, for instance, for fear of alienating voters in the ideological middle. Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and newly minted Florida governor nominee Andrew Gillum are all liberals on the more activist end of the spectrum -- a reflection of what the Democratic Party base wants right now.

One example that illustrates the tonal difference between Capuano and Pressley: Trump impeachment. Capuano spent much of 2017 urging caution for Democrats who wanted articles of impeachment brought against Trump. "We have to respect the process," the Boston Globe quoted Capuano writing in a May 2017 newsletter . "It shouldn't be a witch hunt or a political statement." While Capuano eventually came around and voted for a measure that would have begun the impeachment process against Trump, he was dogged by the idea he was only doing so out of reaction to Pressley's challenge. Of Trump's impeachment, Pressley said : "I'd cast that vote, but a vote is not enough. As leaders we have to ask ourselves as we navigate this new and dangerous terrain together -- how do we resist and progress at the same time?"

2. The Democratic Party's changing face

Boston -- and the Democratic Party -- is in the midst of a massive transformation from a working class, largely white majority into a far more racially and ethnically diverse one. As the Almanac of American Politics notes , Boston was a 95% white city in 1950; it is now 25% black and 19% Hispanic. The Almanac also notes that Boston is now populated by "young singles in rowhouse apartments, professionals in waterfront apartment towers and African-Americans in old triple-deckers."

While Pressley bristled at the idea that she was running primarily as a black candidate, the fact that she was a young, African-American woman (Pressley is 44) and Capuano was an older white man (he is 66) was obvious. And rhetorically, Pressley pushed the idea that she was the new face of a new Boston -- not exactly a racial appeal, but one clearly aimed at suggesting that Capuano represented a Democratic Party that no longer exists.

"This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy," Pressley said in the campaign . "This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life."

Pressley's win -- as well as the victory of Ocasio-Cortez, a female Puerto Rican-American candidate -- speak to that more diverse coalition within the party. As Cook Political Report House editor David Wasserman noted in a tweet on Tuesday night

"The share of House Rs who are white men is 86% and rising.

"The share of House Dems who are white men is 41% and falling."

Make no mistake: The energy of the Democratic Party is on the left. But it's not that simple. Democrats don't just want to nominate liberals. They want to nominate liberals who a) are ready to fight President Trump on literally everything and b) who look more like the new base of the Democratic Party.

Those are the lessons of Ayanna Pressley's win that ambitious 2020 Democrats need to learn.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Before the plane carrying his casket rose to the skies for one final flight to Washington, DC, the late Sen. John McCain got his final sendoff from Arizona on Thursday with a funeral that honored both his enduring commitment to bipartisanship and the state that "enchanted and claimed" him.

Almost a quarter of McCain's fellow senators, Democrats and Republicans, traveled to Arizona to remember him during a carefully executed program that began at the Arizona State Capitol, continued to the Baptist church where he worshiped and ended at the Phoenix airport, where hundreds of Arizona National Guardsmen gave him one final salute.

McCain's flag-draped casket was carried with full military honors from the Capitol, where more than 10,000 Arizonans visited Wednesday to pay their respects, to North Phoenix Baptist Church. With family, friends, scores of former aides and 1,000 average Arizonans in the audience, McCain was eulogized by figures of all political persuasions from former Vice President Joe Biden, to his former chief of staff and potential successor Grant Woods to Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald.

They remembered McCain with laughter and tears, as all the speakers touched on the values he had imparted to them -- a shared humanity, a commitment to civility and compromise and the ideal of country before party.

"My name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democrat. And I love John McCain," Biden said, in an opening quip that captured the tone of the service.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday he would appoint a bipartisan committee to make recommendations for how to commemorate the memory of Sen. John McCain.

"I am glad we are able to form this gang to ensure that a suitable lasting tribute becomes a reality. I'll have more details to share about this group in the coming days," McConnell said.

Right after McCain's death, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, announced he wanted to introduce a resolution to rename the Russell Senate office building after McCain, but that was met with a mixed response from Republicans, many of whom said it was too soon to talk about such a major change -- and some outright nixing the idea.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he would not be in support of renaming the building after McCain -- not out of any disrespect for McCain, but for what it would mean for Richard Russell, a former Senator from Georgia who served for over 40 years, for whom the building is currently named.

"This is a question of making sure that however John is honored, it's set in stone that John is always honored," Cassidy said Tuesday. "I don't want to establish a precedent where somebody is unhonored in the future."

__label__politics (CNN) The political world is paying tribute to Sen. John McCain, who died Saturday at the age of 81. These are the messages of mourning and tribute to the Republican senator, war hero and conservative maverick.

President Donald Trump: "My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!"

First lady Melania Trump: "Our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathy to the McCain Family. Thank you Senator McCain for your service to the nation."

Vice President Mike Pence: "Karen and I send our deepest condolences to Cindy and the entire McCain family on the passing of Senator John McCain. We honor his lifetime of service to this nation in our military and in public life. His family and friends will be in our prayers. God bless John McCain."

Attorney General Jeff Sessions: "For John McCain, his country was his life. He was tireless in its service. Courage, determination, and relentless drive made him a great leader.

"To me, having served with him in the Senate for 20 years, his support for President Bush's surge in Iraq at a time when things had been going badly and public support had eroded, was one of the most dramatic, important, patriotic, and selfless actions I had the honor to witness in that body. His presidential aspirations were entirely set aside. He totally deployed his considerable strength and energy to what he believed was best for his country—and in service to those then fighting valiantly for the mission the nation had given them. It was a very contentious debate. His personal dedication and leadership moved a very uncertain decision to a favorable outcome.

"His ferocious tenacity for his country was unmatched. America has lost one of its greatest patriots."

Barack and Michelle Obama: "John McCain and I were members of different generations, came from completely different backgrounds, and competed at the highest level of politics. But we shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher -- the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched, and sacrificed. We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world. We saw this country as a place where anything is possible -- and citizenship as our patriotic obligation to ensure it forever remains that way.

"Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John's best, he showed us what that means. And for that, we are all in his debt. Michelle and I send our most heartfelt condolences to Cindy and their family."

Former Sen. Joe Lieberman: "Although it was clear that John McCain's life was ending, his death today hurts. America has lost one of the greatest patriots and public servants in our history. And I have lost a dear friend. I was lucky to know him and work with him and am comforted now by great memories of our times together and by the words he spoke to me last summer when he was recovering from the brain cancer surgery: 'I want to live as long as I can but if my life ends soon as a result of this cancer, I will have been blessed to have lived a great life. So I am going to go forward with a lot of gratitude and joy every day I can.' Hadassah and I send our love and prayers to Cindy and the entire McCain family."

Joe Biden: "John McCain's life is proof that some truths are timeless. Character. Courage. Integrity. Honor. A life lived embodying those truths casts a long, long shadow. John McCain will cast a long shadow. His impact on America hasn't ended. Not even close. It will go on for many years to come.

"As a POW, John endured the worst of what human beings can do to one another. In politics, he fell short of his greatest ambition. At the end of his life he faced a cruel and relentless disease. And yet through it all he never lost sight of what he believed most: Country First. And the spirit that drove him was never extinguished: we are here to commit ourselves to something bigger than ourselves.

"John was many things -- a proud graduate of the Naval Academy, a Senate colleague, a political opponent. But, to me, more than anything, John was a friend.

"America will miss John McCain. The world will miss John McCain. And I will miss him dearly.

"On behalf of myself, Jill, and the entire Biden family, our sincerest condolences go out to Cindy, Doug, Andy, Sidney, Meghan, Jack, Jimmy, Bridget, and the entire McCain family."

George W. Bush: "Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled. John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order. He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country. And to me, he was a friend whom I'll deeply miss. Laura and I send our heartfelt sympathies to Cindy and the entire McCain family, and our thanks to God for the life of John McCain."

Bill and Hillary Clinton: "Senator John McCain believed that every citizen has a responsibility to make something of the freedoms given by our Constitution, and from his heroic service in the Navy to his 35 years in Congress, he lived by his creed every day. He was a skilled, tough politician, as well as a trusted colleague alongside whom Hillary was honored to serve in the Senate. He frequently put partisanship aside to do what he thought was best for the country, and was never afraid to break the mold if it was the right thing to do. I will always be especially grateful for his leadership in our successful efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Cindy, his mother, Roberta, his children, and his entire family."

Jimmy Carter: "John McCain was a a man of honor, a true patriot in the best sense of the word. Americans will be forever grateful for his heroic military service and for his steadfast integrity as a member of the United States Senate. Rosalynn and I extend our sincere condolences to Senator McCain's family and to the people of Arizona whom he represented so forthrightly for so many years."

Sarah Palin: "Today we lost an American original. Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life - and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. John McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: "Today is a deeply sad day for the Senate and for our nation. Elaine and I join all Americans in mourning the passing of our dear friend and colleague Senator John McCain.

"In an era filled with cynicism about national unity and public service, John McCain's life shone as a bright example. He showed us that boundless patriotism and self-sacrifice are not outdated concepts or clichés, but the building blocks of an extraordinary American life."

"Generations of McCains have served in our great Navy. John followed their example with distinction. And from his cell in Hanoi to the halls of the Senate, he never stopped fighting with courage and determination -- first for his country, then for the people of Arizona, and always for the ideals he believed in most.

"It is fitting that this war hero and history-changing legislator should leave us as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. John was a constant advocate for his fellow veterans and those currently serving in uniform, standing up for the benefits and care they so earned by defending our freedom. His dedication to them is just one reason among so many why he earned the utmost respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

"It's an understatement to say the Senate will not be the same without our friend John. I will treasure the many memories we've shared together through the years.

"The nation mourns the loss of a great American patriot, a statesman who put his country first and enriched this institution through many years of service. The Senate is keeping Cindy, the McCain family, all John's friends and staff, and the people of Arizona in our prayers at this tremendously difficult time."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: "As you go through life, you meet few truly great people. John McCain was one of them. His dedication to his country and the military were unsurpassed, and maybe most of all, he was a truth teller - never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare. The Senate, the United States, and the world are lesser places without John McCain. Nothing will overcome the loss of Senator McCain, but so that generations remember him I will be introducing a resolution to rename the Russell building after him."

Sen. Lindsey Graham: "America and Freedom have lost one of her greatest champions.....And I've lost one of my dearest friends and mentor. I will need some time to absorb this, but I want Cindy —and the entire McCain family — to know they are in my prayers."

House Speaker Paul Ryan: "This is a sad day for the United States. Our country has lost a decorated war hero and statesman. John McCain was a giant of our time—not just for the things he achieved, but for who he was and what he fought for all his life. John put principle before politics. He put country before self. He was one of the most courageous men of the century. He will always be listed among freedom's most gallant and faithful servants. Our hearts are with his wife, Cindy, his children, and his grandchildren. This Congress, this country mourn with them."

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: "The nation is in tears. Today, with the passing of John McCain, Congress and America have lost a leader and public servant of deep patriotism, outstanding bravery and undaunted spirit. Compelled by his unshakeable faith and deep love of country, he dedicated his life to defending both America and the American idea -- fighting tirelessly to ensure that our nation always remains a land of justice, freedom and hope.

"Over the course of John McCain's years of distinguished service, whether as a naval officer, Member of Congress, U.S. Senator or presidential candidate, we all saw firsthand his integrity, humility, courage and grace. He never forgot the great duty he felt to care for our nation's heroes, dedicating his spirit and energy to ensuring that no man or woman in uniform was left behind on the battlefield or once they returned home.

"Paul and I join with all Americans in mourning the loss of this extraordinary national hero. May it be a comfort to his wife, Cindy, and his beloved children, Douglas, Andrew, Sidney, Meghan, John, James and Bridget, and his beautiful mother, Roberta, that so many people in America and around with the world mourn with them and pray for them during this sad time."

Defense Secretary James Mattis: "We have lost a man who steadfastly represented the best ideals of our country. As a Naval Officer and defiant prisoner of war, John McCain stood with his brothers-in-arms until they returned home together.

"Passionately committed to our country, Senator McCain always put service to the Nation before self. He recognized that for our experiment in democracy to long endure, people of action and passion must serve. In this he represented what he believed, that 'a shared purpose does not claim our identity -- on the contrary, it enlarges your sense of self.'

"His was a life well lived, one whose actions epitomized the motto of his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy: non sibi, sed patriae—'not for self, but for country.'

"On behalf of all of the men and women of the Department of Defense, we will remain forever grateful for the life, the passion, and the example of Senator John McCain. Our sympathy and kindest wishes are with Cindy and his family."

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley: "Tonight we say goodbye to a true hero. A man who never sought accolades. A patriot who fought everyday for American freedom and dignity. A warrior of strength, a patriot of heart, and a man of conviction. There will never be another John McCain. May he rest in peace."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: "Susan and I send our deepest condolences and prayers to the family of @senjohnmccain - an American patriot. We wish you fair winds and following seas."

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr.: "Senator McCain exemplified what it means to be a warrior and dedicated public servant. Both as a naval officer and as a member of Congress, he was a lifelong and tireless advocate for the men and women of the U.S. military.

"He traveled the world to meet personally with Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen, to hear what they had to say, and to see firsthand our military in action on the front lines. Senator McCain recognized the sacrifice and hardships military members and their families can experience and proudly served as their champion in Congress. He visited our nation's wounded warriors around the country to offer encouragement and to thank them for their service. Through his tenacious and selfless leadership in the Senate, he fought hard to ensure our Armed Forces remained strong and had the support and resources needed to succeed when placed in harm's way.

"While we mourn Senator McCain's passing, we are eternally grateful for his distinguished service to our nation, his advocacy of the U.S. military, and the incredible example he set for us all."

Sen. Jeff Flake: "Words cannot express the sorrow I feel at John McCain's passing. The world has lost a hero and a statesman. Cindy and the McCain family have lost a loving husband and father. I have lost a wonderful friend."

Former Sen. Harry Reid: "John McCain was a war hero, a strong, independent fighter and my friend. Our country lost an iconic leader today, and I will miss him terribly.

"John and I fought the good fight since joining Congress together in 1982 and later joining the Senate together in 1986. No one loved America more than John McCain, and he brought his lifelong commitment to service and integrity with him to Washington. Even when we disagreed, there was never any doubt that this man was a national hero who fought with honor. We always had the deepest respect for one another, and our country is better off because of his service.

"John and I both ended our final call a few weeks ago by telling each other, 'I love you,' and that was how we felt about one another. There will never be another John McCain. Landra and I join the country in mourning his passing and offer our condolences to Cindy and their family."

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey: "John McCain is one American who will never be forgotten.

"He was a giant. An icon. An American hero. But here at home, we were most proud to call him a fellow Arizonan. Like so many of us, he was not born here, but his spirit, service and fierce independence shaped the state with which he became synonymous.

"Angela and I join all Arizonans in praying for Cindy and the entire McCain family during this difficult time and offering our full support.

"As we mourn his passing and celebrate his truly phenomenal life, we're also faced with the void John McCain's absence leaves in the heart and soul of our nation.

"John McCain fought for America every day — from the Navy through Vietnam to the U.S. Senate. He fought for what he thought was right, even when it wasn't popular. His dogged patriotism and passion for country made him an inspiration, and a model, for all of us.

"John McCain was about more than politics. He brought us above partisanship and challenged us to be great.

"He once told us, 'We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.'

"May his life and legacy continue to inspire us to build a future for this country, and a history for this country, that would make John McCain proud."
__label__world (CNN) The Chinese government is turning to censorship and appeals for calm, amid mounting public anger following revelations earlier this week that one of the country's largest vaccine makers had violated safety standards.

Furor about the faulty vaccines, an estimated 250,000 of which may have been administrated to children, has continued to dominate Chinese social media, further eroding public trust in essential services.

There are also suggestions the scandal could affect China's standing overseas as the country tries to position itself as a major player in the global pharmaceutical industry.

On Tuesday, the chairperson of the company at the center of the scandal, Gao Junfang of Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, was detained, along with 14 other people involved in the case, according to an official police statement.

The swift actions of the police have so far done little to quell the outcry. Outside the Capital Institute of Pediatrics in Beijing, one of the country's premier children's hospitals, one parent told CNN the company had "no conscience" and the government needed to regulate more strictly.

__label__politics (CNN) Breaking with their House Republican counterparts, the Senate Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that the intelligence community properly concluded in January of last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to help Donald Trump when Moscow meddled in the 2016 election.

The Senate panel released a summary Tuesday of its examination of the intelligence community's January 2017 assessment, which laid out the case of Russia's election meddling and concluded that Putin was trying to help Trump win.

The Senate report said that the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's intentions were sound, which is at odds with the House Intelligence Committee Republicans' report that found "significant intelligence tradecraft failings" in the assessment of Putin's objectives.

"The Committee has spent the last 16 months reviewing the sources, tradecraft and analytic work underpinning the Intelligence Community Assessment and sees no reason to dispute the conclusions," Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said in a statement, reiterating what he had initially said in May.

The unclassified summary released on Tuesday provides details on why the Senate Intelligence Committee agreed with the intelligence community that Russia was trying to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told lawmakers on Thursday he wants to scrap a pay raise for civilian federal workers, saying the nation's budget couldn't support it.

In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Trump described the pay increase as "inappropriate."

"We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases," the President wrote.

An across-the-board 2.1% pay increase for federal workers was slated to take effect in January. In addition, a yearly adjustment of paychecks based on the region of the country where a worker is posted -- the "locality pay increase" -- was due to take effect.

Trump said both increases should no longer happen.

"I have determined that for 2019, both across the board pay increases and locality pay increases will be set at zero," he wrote.

Congress has an opportunity to effectively overrule the President's edict if lawmakers pass a spending bill that includes a federal pay raise. The Senate passed a bill this summer that included a 1.9% raise for federal workers. The House's version did not address federal pay. Senate and House negotiators will negotiate a final measure in the coming weeks.

Trump's 2019 budget proposal, released earlier this year, included a pay freeze for civilian federal workers. It's not clear if Trump would approve a budget that includes the pay increase; the White House has not issued a formal veto threat of the Senate's bill.

In his letter, Trump stressed a pay freeze would not affect the federal government's ability to attract qualified workers, and wrote the government would focus on "recruiting, retaining and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skill sets."

The implications of Trump's decision on the locality pay increase were not immediately clear. Workers based in more expensive parts of the country are paid higher salaries to compensate for the higher cost of living.

In his letter, Trump wrote the locality increase in 2019 would average 25.70% and cost the federal government $25 billion. But he did not say whether the locality adjustments already in place would remain in effect and the White House did not immediately clarify.

Pay for military personnel will not be affected by Trump's decree; instead, US troops are due a 2.6% pay increase next year. Trump frequently trumpets the military pay raise while listing his administration's accomplishments. The raise came as part of a massive $716 billion defense spending bill that Trump signed earlier this month.

That measure, along with a new two-year federal budget and tax cuts heralded by Republicans, have led to accusations Trump is ignoring the federal deficit, despite promising he would address it as president. The tax plan alone is expected to increase the deficit by $1.4 trillion over 10 years, according to a government estimate.

In ordering the raises canceled, Trump cited his statutory authority to adjust pay because of "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare." Yet the President frequently touts a growing US economy, including a strong growth rate for the gross domestic product and low unemployment

"These numbers are very, very sustainable -- this isn't a one-time shot," he said last month after figures showed the US economy grew at a 4.1% annual rate in the second quarter of the year.

The pay raise matter was the latest in a string of moves that reflect an attempt to rein in spending on federal employees. Trump signed executive orders in May that made it easier to fire federal employees and placed limits on public-sector unions. A judge struck down most of those provisions last week.

Reaction on Thursday from Democrats was swift, particularly those from states adjacent to Washington, where large numbers of federal workers reside.

"Zero. This seems to be how much respect President Trump has for federal workers," wrote Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, in a statement. "It is outrageous and hypocritical that after spending billions of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations -- and as the President boasts about the 'great' state of the American economy, that suddenly the White House finds that there is zero money left to pay a minimal cost-of-living adjustment to the patriotic, dedicated public servants."

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, wrote: "Let's be clear: The President's decision to cancel any pay increase for federal employees is not motivated by a sudden onset of fiscal responsibility. Today's announcement has nothing to do with making government more cost-efficient -- it's just the latest attack in the Trump administration's war on federal employees."

While the Washington area contains the largest concentration of federal workers, only 1-in-6 civilian employees of the government live in the region.

The state with the largest number of federal workers is California, followed by Virginia, the District of Columbia and Texas. States Trump won in 2016 -- including Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio -- also rank high on the list of states where federal employees work.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A New York Judge on Tuesday allowed a lawsuit challenging the planned inclusion of a citizenship question in the next US Census to move forward amid "strong" evidence the Trump administration acted in bad faith, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement.

Southern District of New York Judge Jesse Furman also granted Underwood's request for discovery, the statement said.

Critics say the question will penalize immigrants and threaten civil rights. Following the administration's decision to include the question, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said it was "necessary for the Department of Justice to protect voters, specifically to help us better comply with the Voting Rights Act, which is something that's important and a part of this process."

In her statement, Underwood called Furman's decision "a major win in our lawsuit to protect the Census, with a federal judge ordering the Trump administration to provide vital information on how the decision to demand citizenship status was made, and what it may mean for New Yorkers and Americans across the country."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is under federal investigation for tax fraud and possibly misrepresenting his finances, people familiar with the investigation told The Wall Street Journal.

The reported investigation adds to the wide-ranging federal investigation Cohen is already facing in relation to his business affairs and work with Trump. According to the Journal, authorities are investigating whether Cohen underreported his income in federal tax returns, in which he reaped hundreds of thousands of dollars over the last five years.

People familiar with the matter told the Journal that authorities are also investigating whether any bank employees were improperly permitted to offer Cohen loans when he didn't provide adequate documentation. Investigators are reportedly examining Cohen's relationship with Sterling National Bank, which financed Cohen's taxi medallion business, and looking closely at whether Cohen lied or misrepresented information on loan applications.

Investigators are also looking into whether Cohen inflated his income "in loan applications and refinancing efforts," people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

Cohen's former accountant, Jeffrey Getzel, has been subpoenaed as part of the investigation, the paper reports.

__label__world Chemnitz, Germany (CNN) In downtown Chemnitz, the makeshift memorial to the victim of Sunday's stabbing attack, allegedly by two immigrants, still flickers every evening, a sea of candles and flowers that has survived the political turmoil of the last week.

Local residents have come to pay their respects but few want to speak to the media, angry at the way their city has been portrayed.

"It is really terrible and sad what happened in Chemnitz ... in our city. I am not against foreigners or migrants," says one young man who didn't want to be identified.

"But I feel that I can't leave my girlfriend and children alone to go out by themselves. I feel it's no longer safe in our own home town."

A friend comes to pull him away and then hisses: "You'd better tell the truth and nothing but the truth! The media has been full of lies about us!"

Over the course of one turbulent week, the eastern German town of Chemnitz has revealed deep fault lines in the country over the flashpoint issue of refugees and immigration.

"I was surprised by the amount of resistance, distrust and how violently people reacted," says Werner Patzelt, a professor of politics at Technical University Dresden, who has been following the growth of the right-wing movement in Germany. "I fear no political action can stop this disastrous pull of events. There is a growing bitterness in Germany that no political action can stop."

A right-wing supporter gestures to journalists during a confrontation with riot police on Tuesday in Chemnitz.

Vacuum of information

So, how did a homicide in downtown Chemnitz unleash mob anger on the streets?

It started at the crime scene in the vacuum that was created between what police officially reported and what was circulating on social media.

"In the media, it was not immediately clear what had happened," explains Patzelt, "but what was clear was that right-wing extremists had already taken over the narrative. And they decided: We're going to make clear what the 'real reasons' behind this crime are and that's why we demonstrate."

The initial police statement reported a "verbal dispute" between persons of "various nationalities" that turned violent. A 35-year old was killed and two men were apprehended. No other details on motive, weapon or who the suspects might be were released.

But on social media, speculation was rampant. Within hours, online tabloid TAG24 ran a report with the headline: "Man killed attempting to defend woman from molestation." TAG24 attributed the information to a "senior official" at the crime scene.

It went viral. Because it fit a narrative that right-wing extremists have been painting since the 2015 refugee crisis: Foreigners are entering the country to assault local women and attack local men.

It took more than 24 hours for police to reveal that suspects in custody were a Syrian and an Iraqi, confirming some of the swirling rumors online. Then, when right-wing networks published a leaked copy of the arrest warrant, it showed one of the suspects already had a criminal record, fueling the belief that the "real story" was not being told.

As police and politicians remained tight-lipped about the killing, right-wing movements jumped into action. The Chemnitz branch of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party (AfD) posted the TAG24 article and called people to demonstrate. As did Kaotic Chemnitz, a football fan club known for its links to right-wing extremists, which put out a "challenge" to its supporters to come out on to the streets to "show who's in charge of this city."

By Sunday evening, police said more than 800 of them had overwhelmed their officers and filled the streets chanting "This is our city!" and "Foreigners out!"

Things got worse when the headlines hit on Monday morning and social media videos showed angry mobs roaming Chemnitz.

Chancellor Angela Merkel slammed the violence , with her spokesman Steffen Seibert declaring: "This has no place in our country. Such targeting and hunting of people with different looks, different origins, or the attempt to spread hatred on the streets has no place in our cities."

But instead of calming things down, such condemnations seemed only to exacerbate tensions in Chemnitz. On Monday evening, police said 6,000 right-wing protesters, four times the initial estimated number, came out to demonstrate, in some cases driving across the country to join in. This time, Nazi salutes were recorded, not only a brazen violation of German law, but a flagrant rejection of the country's conscientious effort to rehabilitate itself from its wartime history.

Riot police watch right-wing supporters the day after a man was stabbed to death in Chemnitz.

A city divided

All this played into a pre-conceived left-wing narrative: that despite decades of reunification, the former East Germany still lags behind the West, embracing racism instead of a modern multicultural society.

"The bottom line is: there is a wave of concern about migration. Many in Germany, a minority -- but a strong minority -- really dislikes the transformation of German society into a multicultural society," explains Patzelt. "There was also this feel of Western arrogance after reunification. Everything had to be modeled on the ways of the West. But that had unintended consequences. West Germans were accused of not listening to East Germans."

"The mainstream narrative is that the right wing has conquered East Germany and the problem is: racism, racism, racism," Patzelt explains. "But this ignores the feeling of the people. The result is a growing bitterness ... and more votes for right-wing populists."

That has divided the city of Chemnitz itself. On Thursday, about 600 local residents came to attend a town hall with Chemnitz Mayor Barbara Ludwig. She was booed and heckled as she took the stage.

"It was difficult to decide what to do," she began to explain to the room. One man shot back: "Well, that's your job!"

The mayor continued: "People could have mourned quietly after that fatal stabbing. It was not necessary to march violently through the city." She warned: "If we become a city where nobody wants to come here because they are afraid to go out on the street, that is not a good place for us."

Teresa Krollinger Walter, a 51-year old Chemnitz resident, came to hear what solutions the mayor was proposing. She wore a T-shirt that read "No place for hate."

"I was utterly shocked. I thought the video was from another city. Not from Chemnitz. The pictures don't reflect what Chemnitz really is," said Walter. "I don't want this hate. I don't want to worry when my kids are on the street. I don't want this fear in the streets."

Outside, a right-wing demonstration managed to gather about 1,000 people, police said, chanting "Go Away!" to the politicians, and "Lying Press!" to the assembled media.

Michael, a 61-year old from the nearby town of Erfurt didn't want to give his last name but did want to send a message to the media and local politicians: "I'm so angry because things have been so distorted. We're being called Nazis just because we are concerned about migration and our safety.

"I was there on the Monday protests. We were not violent. We did not commit any crimes. All we did was send a message."

He insisted: "None of the politicians, who are normally so quick to comment when there is some violation of a foreigner's rights, not one of those politicians came out to speak their condolences for the murdered, Daniel. What is going wrong with this country?" By Tuesday, Chancellor Merkel issued another statement including her condolences to the victim, as well as condemnation of the protests.

People display candles near the scene of the attack on the 35-year-old man, named by police only as Daniel H.

Politics overshadows grief

At the memorial, there is a photo of the victim, identified by police only as Daniel H.

He was a 35-year old apprentice carpenter of German-Cuban descent. On his Facebook page, he listed his birthplace as "Karl-Marx City," the previous name for Chemnitz under Communist rule. The victim of the crime at the center of all this turmoil was himself something of a migrant, but he was also an East German born and bred. He liked Bob Marley and had a healthy sense of humor.

Despite the flurry of media coverage that his death triggered, there is not much reporting on who Daniel H was, with only a handful of interviews from people who knew him. This is what seems to upset local residents the most: that their grief has been overshadowed by politics.

At the memorial, his friends take turns to keep the candles lit. Only one of his friends agreed to speak to CNN and only without cameras or using his name.

"Daniel was a good friend, a good man. He had no trouble with anyone. But if you took trouble to him..." His voice trails as he struggles to explain: "He was like on the outside of society here. Forgotten. Nobody cared before when he was alive. And nobody cares now when he is dead."

Ignoring the anger and frustration in eastern Germany may have allowed right-wing extremists to fill the vacuum, but political scientist, Werner Patzelt does not see any political will to bridge those differences.

"In the longer run, we need better political education to understand that emotions do not solve problems, to look hard for fact and not listen to rumors." He told CNN: "No one wins if everyone lives in their own universe of facts. We must talk to each other."
__label__politics (CNN) Jahana Hayes moved one step closer towards becoming Connecticut's first black Democrat in Congress on Tuesday when the former National Teacher of the Year bested Mary Glassman in the state's 5th Congressional District primary.

Glassman conceded to Hayes as results streamed in, calling her a "tough competitor" who "ran a good race." The seat was opened when Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty announced she wouldn't be seeking re-election following accusations she mishandled an abuse claim in her office.

President Barack Obama named Hayes, who was then teaching social studies at John F. Kennedy High School in Waterbury, National Teacher of the Year in 2016. She was celebrated for her story: She grew up in a housing project in Waterbury, was raised by her grandmother while her mother struggled with drug addiction and became a mom at 17.

"Our teacher of the year here stands as proof that you can't set expectations high enough for our kids," Obama said. "There's magic in those kids. We just have to find it."

Hayes ran toward her story during her primary campaign, touting the hurdles she overcame to get to her place in life and her campaign prominently featured Obama awarding her the teacher's award.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo released an open letter to President Donald Trump on Saturday that calls the administration's spending to detain immigrant children "shocking and irresponsible."

The letter from the Democratic governor starts out by saying, "Dear President Trump, It is both shocking and irresponsible -- but sadly not surprising -- that your administration is spending over a billion dollars to continue the immoral and un-American policy of detaining immigrant children."

CNN has previously reported that the US government doles out about $1 billion to nonprofits and local government agencies each year to house and provide services for detained migrant children.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the letter.

The Trump administration's immigration policy has been under heightened scrutiny in recent weeks. After facing a backlash, the President reversed course and signed an executive order to halt the separation of undocumented immigrant families at the border. At the end of last month, a federal judge ordered the government to reunite separated families.

__label__world (CNN) China is seeking to "undermine" the international order in the Asia Pacific, Adm. Harry Harris, US President Donald Trump's nominee for ambassador to Australia, said in Washington on Wednesday.

Addressing the US Committee on Armed Services on the challenges facing the US military in the region , Adm. Harris, the highest commander of US forces in Asia Pacific region, said the Trump administration must work to counter Beijing's influence in the region.

"China's intent is crystal clear. We ignore it at our peril," he said in public testimony. "I'm concerned China will now work to undermine the international rules-based order."

Plain-spoken and well-known in the international community for his remarks on US policy in the Asia Pacific, Harris has often provoked a vitriolic reaction from Beijing, in particular for his passionate calls for action in the South China Sea.

His appointment would raise the stakes in the battle for influence in Asia, with experts saying Harris could push the Australian government to tighten military cooperation with its traditional ally.

US President Donald Trump meets with Admiral Harry B. Harris, Jr. in Hawaii on November 3, 2017.

The head of US Pacific Command, Harris was announced in early February as US President Trump's pick as the next ambassador to Australia

The ambassadorship to Australia has been empty for almost 18 months following the end of the former incumbent John Berry's term in September 2016 -- one of a number of key Asia roles that haven't been filled by the Trump administration.

Harris' appointment must be confirmed by the US Congress, and it's not clear exactly when that will happen.

During his testimony to the committee on Wednesday, Harris said China was trying to reorder the Indo-Pacific through "military modernization, influence operations and predatory economics."

"China's impressive military build up could soon challenge the US across almost esvery domain ... If the US does not keep pace, (US Pacific Command) will struggle to compete with the People's Liberation Army on future battlefields," he said.

Taking the gloves off

Born in Yokosuka, Japan, the son of an American naval officer and a Japanese mother, Harris ascended through the ranks of the US Navy to become the highest commander in the Asia Pacific region.

Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, told CNN that Harris was greatly respected by the armed forces and in political circles in Washington DC.

"He may be a good advocate for Australia's interests and position ... He has credibility with the Trump administration so he could very well be viewed as two-way conduit," he said.

Australian leaders warmly welcomed the news of Harris' appointment, including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull who has met with the admiral in Hawaii on at least one occasion.

"Great to see Admiral Harry Harris nominated by (Donald Trump) as US ambassador to Australia. Look forward to seeing you in Canberra, Harry," Turnbull said on his official Twitter on February 10.

Great to see Admiral Harry Harris nominated by @realDonaldTrump as US Ambassador to Australia. Look forward to seeing you in Canberra, Harry! pic.twitter.com/YHvu1NQ4BN — Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) February 10, 2018

Schuster said Adm. Harris was an "innovative and flexible thinker," who was a strong advocate for tighter ties between the US and its allies in Asia.

The admiral's harsh rhetoric comes at a time when Australia finds itself caught between its longtime ally the United States and its major economic partner China.

Euan Graham, director of the International Security Program at Sydney's Lowy Institute, told CNN Harris could help the Trump administration put more pressure on Australia to follow the US line.

"Australia can't continue to expect that it will be able to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to the economic relationship with China and (its US ally),"

"(Harris) is someone who is prepared to take the gloves off when it comes to making hard choices in the relationship between China and the US."

Australia could be more receptive than usual to US persuasion -- in recent months, the government has been taking a hard look at Beijing's influence in Australia, after an opposition Labor Party senator stepped down over taking large donations from a Chinese businessman.

The admiral could push Canberra to show greater enthusiasm for ongoing talks between India, Japan, Australia and the United States about taking part in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Graham said, with the unspoken aim of containing China.

"His nomination singles an interest on the part of the administration to make sure that Australia steps up on questions of defense cooperation, alliance cooperation, where China is concerned," he said.

Beijing's harsh attitude to Harris

Harris has been a longtime critic of the Chinese military's island building campaign in the South China Sea, a position he continued on Wednesday citing Beijing's "aggression" in the area.

In a lecture in Sydney in December 2016, Harris said the US would not give up "shared domains" at sea, "no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea."

Schuster said rather than having an aggressive attitude towards Beijing, Harris instead had a "realistic" approach to China.

"He sees China as a strategic competitor to the US ... he looks at the South China Sea and thinks if we keep ignoring what China is doing there, then China will win by default," he said.

The Chinese government has expressed its open dislike for Harris on multiple occasions in state media and is unlikely to be pleased at the news of his ambassadorship.

In February 2016, Chinese state media Xinhua infamously questioned whether Harris' Japanese ancestry, on his mother's side, had influenced his opinion on the South China Sea.

"Some may say an overemphasis on his background as a Japanese-American general is a bit unkind .. But to understand the Americans' sudden upgraded offensive in the South China Sea, it is simply impossible to ignore Admiral Harris' blood, background, political inclination and values," the piece read.

When asked about Harris' nomination earlier this week, Geng Shuang, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, stressed the need for stability.

"It's a shared responsibility and expectation of countries in the Asia Pacific region to promote stability and development. China hopes the policies and relations of involved countries can benefit the peace and stability, development and prosperity of the region."

Graham said any loud protests by the Chinese government could backfire, particularly given the recent atmosphere of outrage in Australia over allegations of attempts by Beijing to influence domestic policy.

"I think the response, by and large, in Australia would be to swing behind the US alliance," he said.
__label__world (CNN) It's kind of hard to spell China without the letter "N" (at least in English), but the Chinese had to make do without the letter for a while because it was banned.

Yes, that's right: The Chinese government banned a letter.

China banned "N" as part of a widespread censorship clampdown that occurred after word got out Sunday that presidential term limits might be dropped, allowing Chinese President Xi Jinping possibly to stay in power indefinitely

The pushback to this development was intense online. So was the government's pushback to the pushback. In addition to banning use of the letter "N" online, words such as "immortality" and "ascend the throne" were also deemed inappropriate to use on the internet.

Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature at the University of Pennsylvania, said the government likely feared that "N" was referring to the number of terms of office, as in a mathematical equation n > 2.

__label__world Beijing (CNN) Liu Xia, the widow of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, has arrived in Germany after fleeing Beijing, where she spent almost eight years under house arrest.

Liu Xiaobo died of lung cancer last July in a hospital in northeastern China , a month after he was granted medical parole from an 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power."

His wife had been under varying degrees of house arrest since his Nobel award in 2010, and had been prevented from leaving the country, even for medical treatment.

She left China on Tuesday for Berlin, her brother Liu Hui said in a message to friends shared with CNN. Images later showed Liu Xia arriving at Helsinki International Airport. She was later seen being whisked away in a van from the runway at Berlin Airport.

Liu Xia, the widow of Chinese Nobel dissident Liu Xiaobo, smiles as she arrives at the Helsinki International Airport in Vantaa, Finland, on Tuesday.

"My sister left Beijing midday today. She is flying to Europe to start her life anew," he said. "I'm grateful for all those who cared about and helped her over the years. I also pray that our parents and my brother-in-law will continue to bless her. I hope her life from now on is filled with peace and happiness."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A federal government transparency website made public dozens, if not hundreds, of Social Security numbers and other personal information in a design error during a system upgrade.

The error, on a Freedom of Information Act request portal, was fixed after CNN alerted the government to the situation. For weeks prior, however, individuals' sensitive personal information was available on the public-facing database unbeknownst to them or the government.

After a tip from a source who had noticed the glitch, with two quick searches, CNN discovered that the government had published at least 80 full or partial Social Security numbers. There were other instances of sensitive personal information, including dates of birth, immigrant identification numbers, addresses and contact details.

The glitch also exposed other sensitive information about individuals. In one instance, a victim of a violent crime seeking information about the case described the crime. In others, victims of identity fraud seeking more information about their cases had their Social Security Numbers exposed in the process. (In some instances, government agencies require Americans to submit FOIA requests for their own personal information.)

Before publication, CNN alerted the government to the issue. CNN has been told by a spokesman for the agency that maintains the website that the information has been protected. Participating agencies were also notified of the situation.

The portal, foiaonline.gov, is the one-stop clearinghouse for Freedom of Information Act requests to a number of government agencies, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Small Business Administration. It is designed to provide a streamlined and transparent way for Americans to request information from their government.

How the error was made and addressed

A design bug also revealed information about the requester with no safeguards for personally identifiable information.

The problem was with the feature that allowed anyone to search existing FOIA requests. The idea is that people can see what has already been requested, by whom, and in some cases what may have been provided. When users click through to the individual request, the description field is withheld, pending agency approval. Yet those descriptions were viewable in full on the search results page, including if Americans had included their or others' Social Security numbers or any other personal information.

The FOIA clearinghouse is maintained by Environmental Protection Agency, which provides the IT resources to keep it up. It is up to each government agency that uses the portal, however, to take the care to input the information correctly.

When the website was switched from the 2.0 version to the 3.0 version on July 9, the masking feature for descriptions somehow ceased to exist. No one was aware of the issue until alerted by CNN. Upon being alerted, the EPA office managing the site said it attempted to re-mask everything that was an obvious privacy concern, including sensitive information like Social Security numbers.

However, because FOIA requests are public information, it is up to the agencies involved whether to determine whether to withhold information based on a case-by-case application of any FOIA exemptions. Thus, EPA said it was not able to simply turn on a blanket masking of all the descriptions on the 3.0 site, because that could have withheld things that agencies have already determined to be public.

After completing what EPA determined was within its ability, the notice went out to all the agency FOIA system administrators that they should check what was in their control and whether they wanted certain information public. That notice went out Thursday night after EPA completed its piece of the work.

"Recently it was discovered that PII (SSN) information in some records was exposed to the public," the email said, according to a copy obtained by CNN. PII stands for personally identifiable information. "The PMO [Primary Management Office] has identified the cause of this issue and this afternoon implemented program fixes that resolved the problems. This issue will shortly be publicized by the press. It will also be reported that after our fix, that some names and addresses still do appear in publicly available FOIAonline records. A review by the PMO has found that this information has been marked as publicly viewable by the reporting agencies. It is requested that partner agencies review publicly viewable information to ensure that any personal information is specifically intended to be presented as such."

While FOIA requests to the government are considered public, there are many exemptions that the government often applies to protected individual privacy.

EPA spokesman John Konkus told CNN the agency would also investigate if further action was warranted.

"The EPA is aware and working with partner agencies to remediate an issue with the FOIAonline 3.0 system," Konkus said. "The issue affects a limited number of cases and inadvertently displays descriptive information that may, in some instances, include Social Security Numbers. EPA will follow the Agency's Breach procedures to evaluate the situation further and take the appropriate mitigation measures."

It's unknown how many individuals may have had information exposed in the glitch, and for how long. The transition to the new site occurred in mid-July, but older FOIA requests continue to be migrated to the new site.

'It defies logic'

"This is a really significant mistake," said Nuala O'Connor, a former chief privacy officer of the Department of Homeland Security.

"These sorts of data points allow people to engage in identity theft or some kind of harassment, or other malicious behavior," said O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a tech-focused privacy and civil liberties advocacy group. "It puts potentially already vulnerable people at greater risk."

There is no disclaimer about keeping sensitive information out of the request when users go to submit FOIA requests.

In fact, the Customs and Border Protection form encourages anyone seeking information about themselves to "please include as much information as possible to assist us in locating the record(s) you are seeking, to include your Date of Birth, Alien number [an identifier number for US immigrants], your parents' names, and any Alias' you may have used at the time of entry or apprehension."

The Social Security Administration form, though, says the website is not the appropriate place to make requests about individual records.

A privacy notice linked to at the very bottom of the website does warn that "any personal information included in the comment form will be submitted to the Department or Agency to which your request is directed and may be publicly disclosed on FOIAonline or on third-party Web sites on the Internet."

Even if there was some sort of disclosure anywhere about the risk of information becoming public, O'Connor said, "it defies logic and it defies expectation that anyone would think their Social Security number is being exposed when processing a request like this online."
__label__politics (CNN) Democrat Andrew Gillum's breakthrough victory in the Florida primary this week made him the party's third African-American nominee for governor in 2018.

If that number doesn't strike you, consider this: In the history of the US, voters have elected only two African-American governors. The first, Virginia's Douglas Wilder, took office in 1990. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who won consecutive terms in 2006 and 2010, is the only other. (Louisiana's Pinckney Pinchback briefly served after being elevated during Reconstruction in 1872 and David Paterson, of New York, became governor after Eliot Spitzer's resignation in March 2008.)

Wins for Gillum, Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Maryland's Ben Jealous this fall would not only be milestones in their respective states but also would register as perhaps the most stinging rebuke to date of President Donald Trump's brand of racially divisive politics.

The three Democratic nominees are each, to varying degrees, fierce advocates for a brand of progressive politics that is on the upswing among Democrats this primary season. That intersectionality is crucial to how Gillum's campaign views the electorate.

"Black voters, and particularly black women, are the bedrock of the Democratic Party, and it's incredibly important that our candidates and policies reflect that in 2018," said Gillum spokesman Geoff Burgan. "But it's also critically important for us to recognize that issues of economic fairness, race and gender all align under the progressive umbrella -- and those policies are winning at the ballot box."

__label__politics Story highlights "You have to tend to this garden of democracy, otherwise things can fall apart fairly quickly," Obama said

Obama has occasionally voiced thinly veiled criticisms of the Trump administration's policies

Washington (CNN) Former President Barack Obama urged voters this week to stay engaged in democracy, warning that complacency was responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany.

"You have to tend to this garden of democracy, otherwise things can fall apart fairly quickly. And we've seen societies where that happens," Obama said at the Economic Club of Chicago on Tuesday, according to video of the event.

"Now, presume there was a ballroom here in Vienna in the late 1920s or '30s that looked and seemed as if it, filled with the music and art and literature that was emerging, would continue into perpetuity. And then 60 million people died. An entire world was plunged into chaos," Obama said. "So you got to pay attention -- and vote."

During the event, the former President mentioned similar themes of responding to a changing political landscape, mentioning examples from America's history.

"FDR is one of my political heroes. In my mind, the second greatest president after Lincoln. ... But he interned a bunch of loyal Japanese Americans during World War II. That was a threat to our institutions," he said. "There have been periods in our history where censorship was considered OK. We had the McCarthy era. We had a President who had to resign prior to impeachment because he was undermining rule of law. At every juncture, we've had to wrestle with big problems."

__label__politics (CNN) Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday to eight criminal counts and implicated Trump himself in a remarkable courtroom moment.

Cohen admitted that "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office," he kept information that would have harmed Trump from becoming public during the 2016 election cycle.

The charges against Cohen, an attorney for Trump until earlier this year and a member of his inner circle throughout his presidential campaign, bring a climactic end to a months-long investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. And they expose, through the criminal information filed against Cohen in court, that he acted with Trump and his allies, including David Pecker, the CEO of the National Enquirer's publisher, American Media Inc., to suppress potentially damaging claims against the now-President.

The dramatic conclusion to the investigation into Cohen launches a fresh round of questions about Trump's actions. Though Trump himself isn't named, the court filing refers to an Individual-1, who by January 2017 had become president of the United States.

The counts against Cohen included tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-candidate.

Though not named in the plea deal filed in court, the women whom Cohen helped silence were two who have since gone public with their claims of sexual encounters or affairs with Trump: a porn star named Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal. Trump has denied the claims.

In the case of Clifford, Cohen arranged a nondisclosure agreement for which he paid her $130,000, and for that Cohen was charged with making an excessive campaign contribution, since the payment was made in service of the campaign and exceeded the federal limit.

For McDougal, Cohen and the CEO of a media company "worked together to keep an individual from publicly disclosing" information that would have been harmful to a candidate, saying the individual received $150,000. In the summer of 2016, American Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for a contract that effectively silenced her claims of an affair with Trump.

"In or about August 2015, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Corporation-1 ("Chairman-1"), in coordination with MICHAEL COHEN, the defendant, and one or more members of the campaign, offered to help deal with negative stories about Individual-l's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided," the criminal information says. "Chairman-1 agreed to keep COHEN apprised of any such negative stories."

Though the corporation and its chairman are not named, court filings describe the corporation as "a media company that owns, among other things, a popular tabloid magazine."

A spokesman for AMI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The court filings also link AMI to Clifford, saying that in October 2016, an agent for an adult film actress contacted the company and said she was willing to go public with her allegations of an affair with Trump. Pecker then contacted Cohen, and Cohen negotiated with the woman's attorney to "purchase [her] silence" for $130,000.

After Cohen failed to either execute the agreement immediately or pay the woman, she threatened, in late October -- 14 days before the election -- to Pecker to take her story to another publication. Pecker then informed Cohen, in part by calling him on an encrypted phone app. He told Cohen that the deal needed to be completed "or it could look awfully bad for everyone," according to court filings. Cohen then agreed to make the payment and finalize the deal.

Appearing in court on Tuesday, Cohen said of the charge linked to McDougal that it was done "for the principal purpose of influencing the election." Regarding the charge linked to Clifford, Cohen said the money "was later repaid to me by the candidate."

Assistant US Attorney Andrea Griswold said prosecutors would have been prepared to present evidence during a trial that these were so-called hush payments.

"The proof on these counts at trial would establish that these payments were made in order to ensure that each recipient of the payments did not publicize their stories of alleged affairs with the candidate," she said.

Cohen faces up to 65 years in prison.

Judge William H. Pauley set a sentencing date for Cohen for December 12. The judge set a $500,000 bond, which must be co-signed by Cohen's wife and another party.

When checking if he was of sound mind, Pauley asked Cohen whether he had consumed alcohol. Cohen replied that he had some alcohol with dinner the previous evening -- a glass of Glenlivet 12, on the rocks.

The charges against Cohen also covered a range of his activity outside of his work for Trump. In the tax evasion scheme linked to his taxi medallion business, Cohen failed to report more than $4 million in income, according to the criminal information filed against him, resulting in his avoidance of more than $1.4 million in taxes he would have had to owe the Internal Revenue Service.

Cohen also pleaded guilty to making false statements to a bank by understating his medallion debt in order to secure loans to buy property. He had omitted a $14 million line of credit on applications so that he could purchase properties, including a Park Avenue condominium and a summer home. He also got a $500,000 home equity line of credit in April 2016, a loan he never would have gotten if the bank knew of the $14 million debt, the court filings say.

Shortly after 4 p.m. on Tuesday, after having surrendered to the FBI, Cohen entered court in a dark suit, white shirt and gold tie, followed moments later by his attorney, Guy Petrillo.

Also in attendance to observe Cohen's guilty plea in court were Deputy US Attorney Robert Khuzami and the public corruption chief for the Southern District of New York.

"These are very serious charges that reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty," Khuzami said outside the courthouse following the proceedings. "They are significant in their own right. They are particularly significant when done by a lawyer."

By pleading guilty, both Cohen and prosecutors avoid the spectacle and uncertainty of a trial. But the plea deal is a significant blow for Trump, as Cohen was part of Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, working as his personal attorney at the Trump Organization and continuing to advise the President after the election. Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump, but the relationship between the two men has frayed since an FBI raid in April of Cohen's office, hotel room and home.

In turn, Trump has distanced himself from Cohen, who has told friends he has felt isolated, according to the friends . Last month, Cohen told ABC News his loyalty is to his family and country first, not the President.

The Cohen investigation was referred to the Southern District of New York by special counsel Robert Mueller. The plea deal does not include cooperation by Cohen, and it is unclear if he will follow through on his previous assertion to friends , according to sources, that he is willing to talk to Mueller.

It's not clear how the plea deal with Cohen might affect other entities that have been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors as part of the Cohen investigation, including AMI or Pecker.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the alcohol that Cohen said he drank on Monday night.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Monday that he's not sure collusion with Russia would be considered a crime.

But legal experts have repeatedly said that anyone found collaborating with Russia on the 2016 election could be charged with other crimes, such as conspiracy -- and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is ongoing.

Asked about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's upcoming trial, Giuliani told CNN "New Day" co-anchor Alisyn Camerota that Manafort "was not involved with intimate business relationships with Donald Trump."

"Four months, they're not going to be colluding with Russia, which I don't even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians," Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, continued. "You start analyzing the crime -- the hacking is the crime. ... The President didn't hack."

In his wide-ranging interview on "New Day," Giuliani also said he didn't know if Trump's ex-lawyer under criminal investigation, Michael Cohen, would be pardoned by Trump and claimed that Mueller's team has been unresponsive to the Trump legal team's recommendations regarding a potential interview between Mueller and the President for more than a week.

Provisions in the final package address a wide range of issues related to the crisis that is wreaking havoc across the country, such as expanding access to treatment and recovery services, coming up with opioid alternatives for pain treatment, intercepting illegal opioids at mail facilities and combating use of fentanyl. In a time of sharp partisan divides and vitriol, the 396-14 bipartisan vote underscored the reach and scope of the crisis on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers and staff say the issue has become one of, if not the, top issues they hear about from constituents in their states and districts.

With the crisis continuing to see widespread deaths, opioids are an issue that has touched most, if not all, in the states, cities and towns represented on Capitol Hill. During 2016, there were more than 63,600 overdose deaths in the United States, including 42,249 that involved an opioid, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That's an average of 115 opioid overdose deaths each day.

The bill, titled the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, builds onto other efforts by Congress in recent years to tackle the epidemic, including $4 billion in funding earlier this year in a large spending bill. In 2016, the House passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act.

All told, Rep. Greg Walden -- chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the committees that dealt with opioids legislation — described the combination of bills as "one of the most significant congressional efforts against a drug crisis in our nation's history."

__label__politics (CNN) Here are the lawmakers that have signed a petition that would force a House floor vote on immigration bills, according to the House Clerk's Office. The measure needs 218 signatures to move forward, which would require at least 25 Republicans if all 193 House Democrats sign the petition. Only one House Democrat has thus far not signed the petition.
__label__politics Three months ago, that announcement, which Jordan made official Thursday morning, wouldn't have surprised a single, solitary soul in Washington. After all, Jordan, a past chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and a regular, jacket-less cable TV presence, is someone who has not made secret of his considerable ambitions.

But the last month has seen Jordan embroiled in a growing controversy surrounding widespread sexual abuse allegations against Ohio State athletics doctor Richard Strauss. Several former OSU wrestlers have come forward to say that Jordan, who served as an assistant wrestling coach from 1987 to 1995, knew about the abuse . Jordan has totally denied any knowledge of it, and received the support of a number of former OSU wrestling coaches. Jordan acknowledged he has been interviewed by the outside group hired by Ohio State to look into the allegations.

Given all of that, it came as something of a surprise that Jordan decided that now was the time to announce his plan to run for the top spot being vacated by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan at the end of this Congress.

So why did Jordan do it? Here are a few theories:

1. Ambition

Jordan has been regarded as a potential leader -- particularly among conservatives in Congress -- almost since the moment he came to Congress in 2006. Within five years, Jordan was elected as the chairman of the Republican Study Committee -- the conservative wing of the Republican conference in the House. Four years after that, Jordan was the founding chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, an even more select group of conservatives who have served as a fly in the ointment of the Republican leadership over the past 3+ years. There's not a lot of other places for Jordan to go except for the speakership. And, not running this time could turn Jordan into the boy who cried wolf in the eyes of his colleagues.

2. Name-clearing

Jordan isn't the shy and retiring type. Given that, he's not likely to take on a low profile while he fights back against the allegations that he was in the know about Strauss' abominable behavior. It's the most Jordan move possible to announce he's running for speaker amid all of this controversy. In fact; it's a way of him showing that he's not letting what he considers to be unfounded allegations to derail him. That not only will he stay in Congress but he will run for the top job. That's how little these charges have affected him -- or so he wants you to believe.

3. Leverage

Since its formation in January 2015, the Freedom Caucus has shown a remarkable ability to ensure its voting bloc comprises the winning (or losing) margin for House Republicans' priorities. Time and time again, Jordan and his fellow Freedom Caucusers made then Speaker John Boehner's legislative life a living hell. Boehner quit as speaker at least in part due to Jordan's willingness to hold legislation hostage in order to extract more of what the Freedom Caucus wanted; Boehner referred to Jordan as a "legislative terrorist" in this amazing post-Congress profile of him

Whatever Boehner or anyone else thinks of Jordan's tactics, they have a track record of working. And Jordan is at it again with this candidacy. At present, he doesn't have the votes to be elected speaker. And it's not likely he will get them. But here's a dream scenario for Jordan: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) both run for Ryan's job. Neither man is able to secure a majority of the Republican conference, particularly with Jordan in the race. Jordan then becomes the kingmaker, the man who can make either McCarthy or Scalise speaker -- so long as they are willing to give him (and the Freedom Caucus) what he wants.

There is, of course, the possibility that all of this is moot. Democrats are something very close to an even-money bet to retake the House majority this fall and, if that happens, there will only be two jobs -- minority leader and minority whip -- available for ambitious Republicans. It's possible in such a circumstance that McCarthy and Scalise would make a deal where they both just keep their current jobs, cutting Jordan out totally.

But Jordan isn't content to sit around and wait to see what others do. He wants to be a prime mover, someone who acts and makes others react against him. So he decides to run for speaker and sees where the chips fall.
__label__politics Of the eight decades he spent on earth, fully six of them were dedicated to public service. That legacy of service is something the likes of which we may not see again. The passing of McCain provides the American body politic a moment to pause and reflect on the remarkable life of the Arizona Republican.

McCain has been part of collective national consciousness for the better part of the last five decades -- ever since his capture and ultimate release five years later (in March 1973) from a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp . The stories of his torture at the hands of the Vietnamese were -- and are -- excruciating. His unwillingness to use his status -- his father was an admiral in the Navy -- to gain early release from the camp exemplifies a selflessness and sacrifice most of us can't even begin to imagine.

Less than a decade after he emerged gaunt and hobbled from that prison camp, McCain was in the US House. Four years after that -- in 1986 -- McCain was elected to the seat left behind by the retirement of Sen. Barry Goldwater.

Rising star

His rapid rise in politics was slowed during the early 1990s when McCain was implicated in the " Keating 5 " scandal in which he and four other senators were accused of exerting their influence on behalf of a wealthy campaign donor named Charles Keating. The Senate ethics committee ultimately found that McCain "exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators' on Keating's behalf" but added that the actions he undertook "were not improper nor attended with gross negligence."

Slowly but surely, McCain began to build a national profile in the wake of that scandal -- and heavily influenced by it. Having flown too close to the line between money and politics, McCain was reborn as a committed reformer, with campaign finance reform as his main priority.

Even so, McCain was largely ignored as a major player in the 2000 presidential race when he announced his candidacy in September 1999 . Then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was considered the all-but-certain nominee and McCain wasn't seen as one of the people who might even have a puncher's chance against the scion of the first family of Republican politics.

Presidential run

But McCain caught lightning in a bottle in a way that can only happen in the swirl of a presidential primary campaign. Riding around New Hampshire in a bus dubbed the "Straight Talk Express," McCain became the ringmaster of a compelling political circus -- holding court for hours on end with reporters and aides about whatever topic anyone could think of.

It was a political campaign the likes of which seemed to only ever exist in the movies; an exuberant, upstart campaign that played free and loose because the candidate knew he had nothing to lose.

When McCain crushed Bush by 18 points in New Hampshire, he looked and sounded every bit the giant killer -- the maverick who had beaten the Man. Reality hit back hard in the South Carolina primary, which is still seen as one of the nastiest races ever conducted. McCain's loss to Bush there effectively ended his insurgent bid and left him deeply embittered toward Bush and the Republican Party that had rallied against him.

Republican Presidential nomination hopefuls (L-R) George W. Bush, Gary Bauer, and John McCain debate in January 2000.

McCain found a silver lining -- as he always seems to do -- using his newfound national profile to push through comprehensive campaign finance reform -- against the wishes of almost everyone in his party -- in 2002.

By 2004, McCain had shelved the enmity between he and President Bush and campaigned hard for the president's re-election against then Sen. John Kerry -- a move that won over many rank-and-file Republicans who had been leery of McCain's outspoken outsider campaign. When the country started to turn on the Iraq War, McCain encouraged Bush to surge troops back in -- a key decision for his formal rival and the nation.

McCain is unique in politics as someone who will speak his mind and support his conscience. He ran for president in 2008 and started as the front-runner. But, hamstrung by his prominent support for comprehensive immigration reform -- something wildly unpopular to much of the GOP base -- McCain's campaign totally collapsed in the summer of 2007

Lots of politicians -- heck, most of them -- would have given up. McCain just kept getting on those southwest flights to Manchester, New Hampshire. Relentlessly, he began to, again, build himself back up in the state that had launched his first presidential campaign. New Hampshire again went for McCain -- and this time he used it as a springboard to catapult himself to the nomination.

It was a nomination that turned out to be barely worth having. The unpopularity of Bush, the Wall Street collapse and the once-in-a-generation political talent of Barack Obama ensured that the 2008 general election was never really close. (McCain didn't help himself when, in the midst of the financial panic, he declared that "the fundamentals of the economy are strong."

That convincing defeat ended McCain's chances of being president. But it began this most recent phase of his life -- as a statesman.

"I remind all my colleagues: We had an election," McCain said when he returned to the Senate in January 2009 . "I think the message the American people are sending us now is they want us to work together, and get to work."

In the intervening years, McCain cemented his role as a hawkish voice on foreign policy, a fierce defender of the military and, yes, someone who occasionally -- and with glee -- throws a wrench into the machinations of his own party. Following the election of Donald Trump in 2016, McCain has repeatedly blasted the Republican president for his handling of Russia and its efforts to meddle in the election as well as for Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey.

I love @SenJohnMcCain. Unbeatable, unbreakable. He's Teddy Roosevelt's "man in the arena" even when we're on opposite sides. God bless. pic.twitter.com/0sBY4QynWp — John Kerry (@JohnKerry) July 20, 2017

The regard with which McCain is held within the Senate -- and politics more generally -- was reflected in the encomiums offered to him. Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden praised him. So did Ted Cruz and Nancy Pelosi.

Kerry, his former rival, used the Teddy Roosevelt quote, "a man in the arena," to describe McCain. It's one of the Arizonan's favorites. He used it for one of his best TV ads of the 2000 campaign.

McCain, as he was the first to tell anyone who asks, was not a perfect politician. He sacrificed principle in favor of politics at times. He said things in the heat of the moment he regretted later. His story is not "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." He is someone who sacrificed much for the country and to whom the country has given much in return.

His story is truly amazing not because he did everything right or because everything went his way. He didn't. And it didn't. His story is amazing because his life isn't about a steady ascent to the top. It is about a series of falls, missteps and hurdles -- none of which he allowed to beat him.

McCain isn't a man who was never knocked down. He's a man who just kept getting up.
__label__politics (CNN) For the first time since the 1980 US Refugee Act, the number of refugees resettled in the US dropped to be less than all other countries combined in 2017, according to new data compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and published by Pew Research Center.

While many of the top nations that resettle refugees have seen a drop-off (Canada, second to the US, saw 20,000 fewer refugees resettled in 2016 compared to 2017), the US had 64,000 fewer refugees in 2017 than it did in 2016 when the US accepted about 97,000 refugees, according to UN High Commissioner for Refugees data.

The number of refugees admitted to the US in 2017, about 33,000, is on par with the years following the 9/11 terror attacks when there was a temporary decline, but the US still took in more refugees than the rest of the world.

Pew notes that the resettled refugees are different than asylum seekers and refugees who migrate without prior approval from the government, such as those attempting to cross the American southern border.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's team interviewed former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and asked about the firing of FBI Director James Comey, a source briefed on the matter confirmed to CNN.

The source would not say when the interview, first reported by Axios, occurred.

Mueller also has memos written by McCabe documenting his conversations with President Donald Trump, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

The memos also detail what Comey told McCabe about his own interactions with Trump while he was FBI director, the source said, and are seen as a way to corroborate Comey's account in Mueller's probe on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The Associated Press first reported on the existence of the memos and that the special counsel's office has them.
__label__politics (CNN) Amid all of the dizzying headlines over the last month of the Trump administration, you'd be forgiven if you missed one common theme in all those bad headlines. President Donald Trump -- Mr. Never Apologize, or back down or admit you're wrong -- has kinda, sorta done all of those things.

On issue after issue, Trump, faced with public outrage, media scrutiny, and yes, even Republican criticism, has reversed course.

It has been Trump's almost apology tour.

On the separation of families at the border, a policy the administration said was a deterrent, Trump held firm as public outrage grew, until he didn't. There, in the Oval Office, he signed an executive order reversing his own administration's policy . That is called backing down.

On the international stage, while Trump felt free to criticize British Prime Minister Theresa May's approach to Brexit to a tabloid reporter, when he met her face-to-face, he was sorta sorry

"Because when I saw her this morning I said, 'I want to apologize, I want to apologize,' because I said such good things about you. She said: 'Don't worry, it was only the press.' I thought that was very professional," Trump told reporters.

A few other examples:

In his Helsinki presser with Putin, Trump said "would." But later, in an "oops, my bad" admission, Trump said he really meant to say "wouldn't." As in, why wouldn't it be Russia that interfered in the 2016 election?

The President woke up Wednesday declaring how awesome tariffs are and went to bed Wednesday night having announced no additional tariffs on EU goods -- and that the current tariff fight was headed toward resolution. (This came a day after Trump told an audience that the trade fight would be long ... after he previously said it would be easy.)

And what about the Putin-Trump sequel, set for this fall at the White House? Not happening now. The White House announced Wednesday that it will now happen "after the first of the year" once the "Russia witch hunt is over," according to a statement issued by Trump's national security adviser John Bolton.

Trump's reversals come at one of the most active period in his tenure so far, with high-stakes plays on the global stage, and on domestic issues, such as immigration and the economy. His all-in strategy -- and his walk backs -- come as his party faces stiff headwinds this November.

A new NBC News/Marist poll shows him struggling in three key Midwestern states with a majority of voters saying he doesn't deserve re-election and that Congress needs to be a check on his power.

Republicans want a "peace and prosperity" message for the midterms, but tariffs and saber-rattling (see Iran tweet) , complicate that. Not to mention the Russia investigation and the Cohen tapes.

But it turns out, Trump can exercise the political skill of contrition.

"I may be wrong. I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong,' " he said in June, about having faith in Kim Jung Un's commitment to denuclearization. "I don't know I'll ever admit that. I'll find some excuse."

These last weeks, Trump has essentially admitted he was wrong, on issue after issue, and going forward, it will be hard to find believable excuses. Though in classic Trump style, he already seems to have one ready for the midterms. If Democrats win, it's the Russians.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering posthumously pardoning boxer Muhammad Ali, who was convicted in 1967 after refusing military service in Vietnam -- even though Ali's attorney called it "unnecessary."

"I'm thinking about Muhammad Ali. I'm thinking about that very seriously and some others," Trump said, while speaking to reporters at the White House before departing for the Group of Seven summit. "And some folks that have sentences that aren't fair."

Ali's attorney, Ron Tweel, told CNN that there was no contact whatsoever between anyone in the Trump administration and members of the Ali family about the issue.

"So, it's not like for weeks or days the administration has reached out to the Ali family. None of that," he told CNN. "This was all spontaneous and I think, as a lot of people like to say, impulsive."

Tweel said he could only guess what spurred the President's comments.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin is remarkable on a number of levels but none more so than this one: For a man who is ready, willing and able to attack anyone, Trump never has a bad word to say about Putin. And for a man who appears to have the attention span and message discipline of a toddler, Trump is somehow able to stick to his say-nothing-bad-about-Putin strategy.

It's actually somewhat amazing when you think about it. Which is what this tweet from David Gelles , executive producer of CNN's political programming, got me to do over the weekend:

"Things Trump Has Insulted on Twitter more than Putin (a partial list):

Amazon

NFL players who kneel

Judges

Robert De Niro

Harley Davidson

Mitch McConnell

The Red Hen

Jeff Sessions

UCLA basketball players

Oprah

Maxine Waters"

Stunning, no? And as Gelles notes, this is far from a complete list of Twitter attacks from Trump. To expand on Gelles' list, here's some of what Trump has recently tweeted about the 11 people, places or things listed above.

1. Amazon: "The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their "delivery boy" for a BIG percentage of their packages....In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?"

2. NFL players who kneel: "The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can't believe it! Isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!"

3. Judges: "Hiring many thousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country." ( "Hiring many thousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional.

5. Harley Davidson: " Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I've done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!"

( : "Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!" ( 8/10/17

7. The Red Hen: "The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!"

8. Jeff Sessions: "The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!"

10. Oprah: "Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!" ( : "Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!" ( 2/18/2018

11. Maxine Waters: "Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats" ( : "Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party.

In each of these cases, Trump would say he is responding to being attacked -- whether directly (as is the case with De Niro) or indirectly (NFL players kneeling). They hit him. So he hit them back.

And yet: The US intelligence community has unanimously concluded that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election -- a move that seems like a direct shot at, well, democracy itself. And Trump remains silent on Putin and the country he rules. Hmmm.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the United States is prepared to put additional sanctions in place against Turkey if the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan does not release American pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held since 2016.

"We've put sanctions on several of their cabinet members, working with you (President Donald Trump), we have more that we're planning to do if they don't release him quickly," Mnuchin told Trump during Thursday's cabinet meeting.

During a Cabinet meeting Thursday, Trump had harsh words for the NATO ally saying, "They have not proven to be a good friend." Trump added the pastor is a "very innocent man" and "we got somebody out for him -- he needed help getting somebody out of some place. They came out. They want to hold our wonderful pastor. Not fair, not right."

The threat of sanctions comes amid Trump's concerns over Brunson, who is accused of being involved with an attempted coup that led to tens of thousands of people being arrested in 2016.

Tensions between Turkey and the US have been on the rise as Trump has pressed for the release of the pastor. US officials maintain there is no credible evidence against Brunson, and the Trump administration has negotiated for weeks to secure his release.

__label__politics For months, he had been demanding a fully uncensored version of a highly sensitive document from the Justice Department explaining how the Russia investigation began in 2016, but he wasn't getting it.

As the standoff escalated, Nunes began warning Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- the man in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation -- that he could face contempt of Congress, or even worse.

"We're not going to just hold in contempt," Nunes said to Fox News last month. "We will have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach."

Nunes had already been offered time to review a copy of the electronic communication formally authorizing the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, but he had publicly demanded to see what was behind certain blacked out lines.

Facing the growing pressure, and outrage from President Donald Trump, Rosenstein finally relented in early April -- and granted Nunes and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina access to the document with only minimal redactions to protect the name of a foreign country and agent, along with all members of the House Intelligence Committee.

But when the pair arrived at the Justice Department to review the electronic communication, officials were caught off-guard by his next move. Nunes -- sitting with a copy of the document in an unopened folder directly in front of him -- opted not to read it, according to four sources with knowledge of the situation.

Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, reviewed a copy and since then nearly a dozen other lawmakers have gone to the Justice Department to read the document, sources say.

As Nunes has moved aggressively to publicly sow doubt about the Russia investigation, the moment marked at least the second time that he has demanded sensitive documents from the Justice Department, only to choose not to read them -- allowing his staff or Gowdy to pore through the materials instead. The California Republican admitted in February that he did not read any applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

His supporters say there's nothing untoward about a chairman being briefed by his staff. But critics say it's another sign Nunes is merely interested in wielding his power to target his political enemies and give cover to Trump, rather than independently learning about the nuances of a complex investigation.

Asked twice in recent days if he personally had read the document that he demanded detailing the start of the Russia probe, Nunes pointedly refused to answer.

"You know I don't talk about committee business," he told CNN.

Asked later for a yes-or-no answer, Nunes repeated the same refrain: "You know I don't talk to you about this stuff."

A Nunes spokesman also would not say if his boss read the documents he's demanded from the department.

"I admire CNN's unrivaled ability to faithfully produce foolish hit pieces on Republicans that are spoon-fed to them by anonymous sources," Nunes spokesman Jack Langer said in a statement, providing no further comment.

After being briefed on the documents about the start of the Russia probe, Nunes began to raise major alarms, telling Fox News there was no basis to launch the investigation in the first place, saying there were "major problems" with the investigation.

Yet Gowdy has not gone nearly so far.

Indeed, unlike Nunes, Gowdy has defended the Mueller investigation amid criticism within his own party.

Gowdy spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said her boss has "read everything he has been asked to read," including the electronic communication with minimal redactions and the FISA documents about the surveillance on Page. She said he "fully supports" the Russia investigation and the asking of "fair but firm" questions of officials in the Executive Branch.

"While he was not surprised by what he read, Chairman Gowdy does have additional questions for the drafter of the EC," Gonzalez said, referring to the electronic communication. "As Chairman Gowdy has said many times, he fully supports Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, and believes Mueller should be given the time, the independence, and the resources to conduct a thorough investigation."

Democrats say being briefed on crucial documents is insufficient.

"You have to go and read this stuff, you can't just get briefed by people who are making it their crusade to undermine the investigation," California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the committee, told CNN when another GOP member, Rep. Peter King of New York, said he had been briefed by Nunes' staff on the document. "I just don't understand why they wouldn't go over and read it themselves. I mean, the Department of Justice is 10 blocks away from here, and it took me 90 minutes to read."

The Justice Department declined to comment.

A pattern of demands

Nunes took a similar tack when he pushed the Justice Department to give him full access to classified materials regarding the dossier on Trump and Russia, namely the FISA application to monitor Page, who advised the Trump campaign on foreign policy issues. After months of furious lobbying, where House Speaker Paul Ryan got involved as well, the Justice Department ultimately allowed lawmakers to review the FISA application.

Initially, the Justice Department let the House Intelligence Committee and other panels designate one Republican and one Democratic lawmaker, along with two staff members, to review more than 1,000 pages of classified materials . Nunes designated Gowdy to do so on his behalf. That review later became the basis of the so-called, "Nunes memo," which Nunes and Trump seized on to accuse the Justice Department and FBI of improperly monitoring Page just weeks before the 2016 election.

"The committee has discovered serious violations of the public trust," Nunes said after the memo's release.

At least 19 lawmakers have personally reviewed the FISA application at the Justice Department, according to sources. Nunes' senior staff has reviewed the records. But Nunes still has not done so.

Nunes, however, has been coy about whether he's personally read the documents he's demanded.

After heading to the Justice Department to see the electronic communication, Nunes left the impression he had personally reviewed the document. In an interview with Fox Business last month, the first question was whether he had seen the document.

"That's correct," Nunes responded, adding "it took us a long time" to access the document.

Yet, he also mentioned on multiple occasions that his "investigators" had reviewed the record.

"So what we found now, after the investigators have reviewed it, is that in fact there was no intelligence," Nunes said to Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, calling it a "major problem."

Asked if that meant there was no official intelligence to start the Russia probe, Nunes said, "I think that's the point. We don't understand, we've never understood. We have access to these finished intelligence products and we've never seen one" reason to start the probe.

Republicans and Democrats have come away from viewing the electronic communication with completely opposite views about its significance. Neither party has discussed the details of what's in it, however, because the document is classified.

"Having reviewed that document, the FBI had ample reason to initiate an investigation," said Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat on the committee. "Would the information have convicted in a court of law? No, but that's not the standard when you start an investigation. It would have been an act of gross negligence based on the evidence at hand had the FBI declined to follow up on the leads that they had."

"I want to meet the FBI supervisor who would not open an investigation with the information that they had," Swalwell said. "The information that started the investigation was alarming, and the evidence that Carter Page was an agent of a foreign power was voluminous."

Page has acknowledged that he had " brief interactions " with a low-level Russian official in 2013, but has vehemently denied any allegations of wrongdoing.

Several Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee say the electronic communication shows the documentation for the start of the Russia investigation was unfounded.

"It's a fair question: What evidence did you have to start this investigation?" said Rep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican who sits on the committee. "Well, the answer isn't very good."

King, who also sits on the panel, said that it showed the start of the investigation was "baseless."

"To me, there was no real basis for the investigation to begin in the first place," King said. The FBI was "using a backdoor process to rely on data, which did not rise to any intelligence level. Rumors, rather than intelligence."

King said at the time that he hadn't yet read the document, but had been briefed by Nunes' staff.

(CNN) If Michael Cohen can show federal prosecutors credible evidence that President Donald Trump knew in advance about the infamous Trump Tower Russia meeting of June 9, 2016 -- as Cohen now reportedly claims -- the President's son could be facing perjury charges.

It was Donald Jr. who approved the time, location and participants in a meeting that included a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and a Russian-American lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin. He also brought to the Trump Tower conference table the then-chairman of Trump's campaign, Paul Manafort, and brother-in-law Jared Kushner among others.

The President has repeatedly denied being told about the meeting before it happened. He has said this to the press and the public, most recently on Friday via Twitter , but apparently never to federal investigators or under oath. Under the circumstances, if Cohen's claim is corroborated -- a big "if" -- this may be a reprehensible lie, but it's not necessarily criminal. Still, it is so serious that it could theoretically give special counsel Robert Mueller the leverage to propose a deal: Resign the presidency in exchange for immunity for Don Jr. Otherwise Don Jr. will be indicted for lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and could -- again, theoretically -- go to jail.

__label__world (CNN) Tens of thousands of Romanians flooded the capital Bucharest on Saturday for a second night of anti-government protests, a day after violent clashes injured more than 400 people.

About 40,000 demonstrators gathered in the city's Victoriei Square, blowing horns and shouting "Resignation!, Resignation!" to protest what they say is a corrupt government, according to Reuters

People wave Romanian national flags during Saturday's rally.

However there was not the kind of violence seen on Friday night, when the crowds were larger and police, or gendarmes, fired tear gas as they clashed with protesters, state-run news agency Agerpres reported.

Over 400 people received medical care at the square that night and two gendarmes were attacked, it said.

Protesters gather outside government offices in Bucharest on Saturday.

In a statement issued Friday night, Romania's President Klaus Iohannis condemned the "brutal intervention of the Gendarmerie," saying their actions were "strongly disproportionate with the demonstrations of the majority of people in Victoria Square."

__label__politics Woodward's 448-page book, "Fear: Trump in the White House," provides an unprecedented inside-the-room look through the eyes of the President's inner circle. From the Oval Office to the Situation Room to the White House residence, Woodward uses confidential background interviews to illustrate how some of the President's top advisers view him as a danger to national security and have sought to circumvent the commander in chief.

Many of the feuds and daily clashes have been well documented, but the picture painted by Trump's confidants, senior staff and Cabinet officials reveal that many of them see an even more alarming situation — worse than previously known or understood. Woodward offers a devastating portrait of a dysfunctional Trump White House, detailing how senior aides — both current and former Trump administration officials — grew exasperated with the President and increasingly worried about his erratic behavior, ignorance and penchant for lying.

Chief of staff John Kelly describes Trump as an "idiot" and "unhinged," Woodward reports. Defense Secretary James Mattis describes Trump as having the understanding of "a fifth or sixth grader." And Trump's former personal lawyer John Dowd describes the President as "a fucking liar," telling Trump he would end up in an "orange jump suit" if he testified to special counsel Robert Mueller.

"He's an idiot. It's pointless to try to convince him of anything. He's gone off the rails. We're in crazytown," Kelly is quoted as saying at a staff meeting in his office. "I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had."

CNN obtained a copy of Woodward's book, scheduled for release September 11. The explosive revelations about Trump from those closest to him are likely to play into the November midterm election battle. The book also has stunning new details about Trump's obsession with the Russia probe, describing for the first time confidential conversations between the President's lawyers and Mueller. It recounts a dramatic session in the White House residence in which Trump failed a mock Mueller interview with his lawyers.

In separate statements Tuesday afternoon, Kelly denied that he called Trump an "idiot," Dowd denied using the "orange jump suit" phrase and Mattis said the quotes attributed to him were "a product of someone's rich imagination."

The White House accused Woodward of spreading "fabricated stories" about Trump.

"This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. "While it is not always pretty, and rare that the press actually covers it, President Trump has broken through the bureaucratic process to deliver unprecedented successes for the American people. Sometimes it is unconventional, but he always gets results."

Woodward, however, said he stood by his reporting in a statement obtained by CNN.

He sums up the state of the Trump White House by writing that Trump was an "emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader." Woodward writes that the staff's decision to circumvent the President was "a nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world."

Circumventing the President

The book opens with a dramatic scene. Former chief economic adviser Gary Cohn saw a draft letter he considered dangerous to national security on the Oval Office desk.

The letter would have withdrawn the US from a critical trade agreement with South Korea. Trump's aides feared the fallout could jeopardize a top-secret national security program: the ability to detect a North Korean missile launch within just seven seconds.

Woodward reports Cohn was "appalled" that Trump might sign the letter. "I stole it off his desk," Cohn told an associate. "I wouldn't let him see it. He's never going to see that document. Got to protect the country."

Cohn was not alone. Former staff secretary Rob Porter worked with Cohn and used the same tactic on multiple occasions, Woodward writes. In addition to literally stealing or hiding documents from Trump's desk, they sought to stall and delay decisions or distract Trump from orders they thought would endanger national security.

"A third of my job was trying to react to some of the really dangerous ideas that he had and try to give him reasons to believe that maybe they weren't such good ideas," said Porter, who as staff secretary handled the flow of presidential papers until he quit amid domestic violence allegations. He and others acted with the acquiescence of former chief of staff Reince Priebus, Woodward reports.

Woodward describes repeated attempts to bypass Trump as "no less than an administrative coup d'état."

The Russia obsession

Woodward's book relies on hundreds of hours of taped interviews and dozens of sources in Trump's inner circle, as well as documents, files, diaries and memos, including a note handwritten by Trump himself. Woodward explains that he talked with sources on "deep background," meaning he could use all the information but not say who provided it.

His reporting comes with the credibility of a long and storied history that separates this book from previous efforts on Trump. The author and Washington Post journalist has won two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for his coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation.

In one revelatory anecdote, Woodward describes a scene in the White House residence. Trump's lawyer, convinced the President would perjure himself, put Trump through a test — a practice interview for the one he might have with Mueller. Trump failed, according to Dowd, but the President still insisted he should testify.

Woodward writes that Dowd saw the "full nightmare" of a potential Mueller interview, and felt Trump acted like an "aggrieved Shakespearean king."

But Trump seemed surprised at Dowd's reaction, Woodward writes. "You think I was struggling?" Trump asked.

Then, in an even more remarkable move, Dowd and Trump's current personal attorney Jay Sekulow went to Mueller's office and re-enacted the mock interview. Their goal: to argue that Trump couldn't possibly testify because he was incapable of telling the truth.

"He just made something up. That's his nature," Dowd said to Mueller.

The passage is an unprecedented glimpse behind the scenes of Mueller's secretive operation — for the first time, Mueller's conversations with Trump's lawyers are captured.

"I need the president's testimony," Mueller said. "What was his intent on Comey? ... I want to see if there was corrupt intent."

Despite Dowd's efforts, Trump continued to insist he could testify. "I think the President of the United States cannot be seen taking the fifth," Trump said.

Dowd's argument was stark: "There's no way you can get through these. ... Don't testify. It's either that or an orange jump suit."

What he couldn't say to Trump, according to Woodward, was what Dowd believed to be true: "You're a fucking liar."

In a statement Tuesday, Dowd denied some of the key anecdotes and quotes attributed to him in the book. He criticized Woodward for fueling an "endless cycle of accusations and misrepresentation."

"I do not intend to address every inaccurate statement attributed to me -- but I do want to make this clear: there was no so-called 'practice session' or 're-enactment' of a mock interview at the Special Counsel's office," Dowd said. "Further, I did not refer to the President as a 'liar' and did not say that he was likely to end up in an 'orange jump suit'. It was a great honor and distinct privilege to serve President Trump."

Trump's insults and humiliation

Throughout the book, Woodward portrays the President as a man obsessed with his standing in the media and with his core supporters. Trump appears to be lonely and increasingly paranoid, often watching hours of television in the White House residence. "They're out to get me," Trump said of Mueller's team.

Trump's closest advisers described him erupting in rage and profanity, and he seemed to enjoy humiliating others.

"This guy is mentally retarded," Trump said of Sessions. "He's this dumb southerner," Trump told Porter, mocking Sessions by feigning a southern accent.

Trump said that Priebus is "like a little rat. He just scurries around."

And Trump demeaned former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to his face, when Giuliani was the only campaign surrogate willing to defend then-candidate Trump on television after the "Access Hollywood" tape, a bombshell video where Trump described sexually assaulting women.

"Rudy, you're a baby," Trump told the man who is now his attorney. "I've never seen a worse defense of me in my life. They took your diaper off right there. You're like a little baby that needed to be changed. When are you going to be a man?"

Trump's predecessors are not spared either. In a conversation with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Trump called President Barack Obama a "weak dick" for not acting in Syria, Woodward reports.

National security concerns

Woodward's book takes readers inside top-secret meetings. On July 27, 2017, Trump's national security leaders convened a gathering at "The Tank" in the Pentagon. The goal: an intervention to try to educate the President on the importance of allies and diplomacy.

Trump's philosophy on diplomacy was personal. "This is all about leader versus leader. Man versus man. Me versus Kim," he said of North Korea.

His inner circle was worried about "The Big Problem," Woodward writes: Trump's lack of understanding that his crusade to impose tariffs could endanger global security.

But the meeting didn't go as planned.

Trump went off on his generals. "You should be killing guys. You don't need a strategy to kill people," Trump said of Afghanistan.

He questioned the wisdom of keeping US troops in South Korea.

"So Mr. President," Cohn said to Trump, "what would you need in the region to sleep well at night?"

"I wouldn't need a fucking thing," the President said. "And I'd sleep like a baby."

After Trump left the Tank, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared: "He's a fucking moron."

The book provides the context for the now-infamous quote that marked the beginning of the end for Tillerson's tenure. Tillerson tried to downplay the dispute -- "I'm not going to deal with petty stuff like that," he said at a news conference after NBC reported the remark — but he was ultimately fired via tweet.

Woodward also quotes an unnamed White House official who gave an even more dire assessment of the meeting: "It seems clear that many of the president's senior advisers, especially those in the national security realm, are extremely concerned with his erratic nature, his relative ignorance, his inability to learn, as well as what they consider his dangerous views."

A recurrent theme in Woodward's book is Trump's seeming disregard for national security concerns because of his obsession with money — trade deficits and the cost of troops overseas.

In meeting after meeting, Trump questions why the US has to pay for such a large troop presence in South Korea.

"We're doing this in order to prevent World War III," Mattis, the defense secretary, bluntly explained to Trump at one January 2018 meeting, which prompted Mattis to tell close associates afterward that Trump had the understanding of a "fifth or sixth grader."

Trump still wasn't convinced. "I think we could be so rich if we weren't stupid," he later said in the meeting, arguing the US was being played as "suckers," Woodward reports.

The 'Ernest Hemingway' of Twitter

Trump's tweets — and his infatuation with Twitter — are a theme throughout the book.

Woodward reveals that Trump ordered printouts of his tweets and studied them to find out which ones were most popular. "The most effective tweets were often the most shocking," Woodward writes.

Twitter was a source of great consternation for national security leaders, who feared — and warned Trump — "Twitter could get us into a war."

Appalled by some of his more outrageous posts, Trump's aides tried to form a Twitter "committee" to vet the President's tweets, but they failed to stop their boss.

Priebus, who was blindsided when Trump announced his firing on Twitter, referred to the presidential bedroom as "the devil's workshop" and called the early morning hours and Sunday night — a time of many news-breaking tweets — "the witching hour."

Trump, however, saw himself as a Twitter wordsmith.

"It's a good thing," Trump said when Twitter expanded its character count to 280, "but it's a bit of a shame because I was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters."

'A zoo without walls'

Finally, "Fear" is filled with slights, insults and takedowns from both family and staff that speak to the chaos, infighting and drama that Trump allows to fester around him.

Both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are targeted by the inner circle.

There is a pointed shot at Ivanka from the President's now-ostracized chief strategist Steve Bannon, who frequently clashed with the first daughter and her husband.

"You're nothing but a fucking staffer!" Bannon screamed at Ivanka at a staff meeting, according to Woodward. "You walk around this place and act like you're in charge, and you're not. You're on staff!"

"I'm not a staffer!" she shouted back. "I'll never be a staffer. I'm the first daughter" — she really used the title, Woodward writes — "and I'm never going to be a staffer!"

Two of the harshest comments in the book are directed at Trump and come from his chiefs of staff.

After Trump's Charlottesville, Virginia, controversy , in which he failed to condemn white supremacists, Cohn tried to resign but was instead dressed down by Trump and accused of "treason."

Kelly, who is Trump's current chief of staff, told Cohn afterward, according to notes Cohn made of the exchange: "If that was me, I would have taken that resignation letter and shoved it up his ass six different times."

And Priebus, Trump's first chief of staff, encapsulated the White House and the thrust of Woodward's book by describing the administration as a place with "natural predators at the table."

"When you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls," Priebus is quoted as saying, "things start getting nasty and bloody."

UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect Mattis' and the White House's responses to Woodward's book, as well as Woodward's defense of his reporting.
__label__politics (CNN) If President Donald Trump were impeached, "the American people would revolt," the President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in an interview with Sky News.

"You'd only impeach him for political reasons, and the American people would revolt against that," Giuliani said Thursday.

When asked about whether Trump was destined for "inevitable" impeachment, Giuliani replied, "Hardly," and went on to say things have, in fact, "turned very much in the President's favor."

"I think it's inevitable that he won't" be impeached, Giuliani said. "President Trump is completely cleared. You have this Cohen guy, he doesn't know anything about Russian collusion, doesn't know anything about obstruction."

Michael Cohen used to serve as Trump's personal lawyer, but has recently found himself in a whirlwind of legal battles.

__label__politics The piece is remarkable. Identified only as a "senior official in the Trump administration," the piece lays out how the author -- as well as other colleagues within the administration -- are waging a semi-open campaign to keep the President from doing too much damage to the nation.

"Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations," the author writes.

Beyond the way the author is identified, there are very few clues about who it could be. And the description used by the Times -- "a senior official in the Trump administration" -- is broad enough to include virtually anyone in the Trump White House, a Cabinet official, undersecretary or someone on, say, the National Security Council.

Beyond that, the only hint we have comes from this tweet of the op-ed , from The New York Times social team: "In an anonymous Op-Ed, a senior Trump administration official says he and others are working ​to frustrate the president's 'misguided impulses.'"

Later, a spokeswoman for the Times said that the tweet was a mistake. "The tweet was drafted by someone who is not aware of the author's identity, including the gender, so the use of 'he' was an error," Danielle Rhoades Ha said.

What we know: The guessing game of who wrote the op-ed will dominate official Washington circles for the foreseeable future. And everyone who fits the description of a "senior Trump administration official" will have to answer as to whether it was them.

Another thing we know: Trump is pissed. "TREASON?" Trump is pissed. "TREASON?" he tweeted on Wednesday night

Below, 13 people who might be the author of the op-ed, based on what we know about the various factions, likes, dislikes, motivations and ambitions within the Trump administration. These are in no particular order.

Don McGahn

We know the White House counsel is a short-timer -- planning to leave in the fall. We also know that McGahn has clashed with Trump repeatedly in the past -- refusing Trump's order to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. And McGahn has already shown a willingness to look out for the broader public good, sitting down for more than 30 hours with special counsel Robert Mueller's team to aid their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Dan Coats

The Director of National Intelligence is very much a part of the long-term Washington establishment, having spent not one but two stints in the nation's capital as a senator from Indiana. Coats has also shown a tendency to veer from the Trump songbook. Informed of Trump's plans to invite Russian president Vladimir Putin for a summit in the United States this fall, Coats said "That is going to be special" -- a line that drew the ire of the President.

Kellyanne Conway

Conway, a White House counselor, is someone who has survived for a very long time in the political game. And not by being dumb or not understanding which way the wind blows. Plus, there is the X-factor of her husband -- George -- whose Twitter feed regularly trolls Trump

John Kelly

The chief of staff has clashed repeatedly with the President and seems to be on borrowed time . Kelly sees his time in the job as serving his country in the only way left to him. Might he view exposing Trump in this way as a last way to be of service?

Kirstjen Nielsen

The head of the Department of Homeland Security is a close ally of Kelly, who we know has a very fraught relationship with Trump. And she has reasons of her own: Trump scolded her in a Cabinet meeting over the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country. Nielsen reportedly drafted a resignation letter but backed away.

Jeff Sessions

Sessions sticks out as a possibility for a simple reason: He's got motive . No one has been more publicly maligned by Trump than his attorney general. Trump has repeatedly urged Sessions to use the Justice Department for his own pet political concerns. And this week, Sessions found out that Trump has referred to him as "mentally retarded" and mocked his southern accent, according to a new book by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Sessions is also someone who spent two decades in the Senate prior to being named attorney general by Trump after the 2016 election.

James Mattis

The defense secretary has been Trump's favorite Cabinet member. But the quotes attributed to Mattis in Woodward's book are VERY rough on Trump, though Mattis quickly denied that he ever said them. And if anyone has less to lose than Mattis -- he is a decorated military man serving his country again -- it's hard to figure out who that would be. Plus, Mattis is an ally of John Kelly (see above) and Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state that Trump ran out on a rail.

Fiona Hill

Hill, a Russian expert who joined the Trump administration from the Brookings Institution, a DC think tank, might have reason to so publicly clash with Trump. She is far more skeptical about Russia's motives than Trump -- and was notably left out when Trump and Putin huddled on the sides of the G20 meeting in Germany in 2017. She was a close adviser to national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who was removed from the White House . And, she was also reportedly mistaken for a clerk by Trump in one of her earliest meetings with him on Russia.

Mike Pence

The vice president is all smiles, nods and quiet, deferential loyalty in public. Which of course means that he has the perfect cover to write something like this in The New York Times. Pence is also ambitious -- and there's no question he wants to be president. But would taking such a risk as writing this scathing op-ed be a better path to the White House than just waiting Trump out?

Nikki Haley

The United Nations ambassador is, like Pence, one of Trump's favorites. She is also, however, someone deeply engaged on the world stage and a voice of concern when it comes to how the President views Russia and Putin. Haley, again like Pence, is ambitious and has her eye on national office. Would this service that goal?

Javanka

The combination of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump -- Javanka! -- writing this op-ed would be right out of a soap opera. But that is sort of a perfect way to describe the Trump administration, right? Ivanka Trump said she would work to make her voice heard to her father , but there's little evidence he's listened much to her or her husband. Might this be a bit of revenge?

Melania Trump
__label__politics (CNN) The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won't -- for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn't seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.

The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall — and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means — and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months — that, ultimately, this isn't a legal fight, it's a public relations one.

Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota. "I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it," Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.

"My version" vs. "their version." What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the "versions" will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other "version" will be Giuliani's cable TV appearances and President Trump's tweets.

That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion -- particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump's side.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said the person he most wants to run against in 2020 is Oprah Winfrey, predicting the campaign "would be a painful experience for her."

"Oh, I'd love Oprah to win," Trump said. "I'd love to beat Oprah. I know her weakness."

Trump said he knows Winfrey well and repeated that he would love to run against her.

Speculation mounted earlier this year that Winfrey might seek the presidency in 2020, following a speech at the Golden Globes and comments from close friends that she was considering it.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump threatened Sunday to push the government into a shutdown ahead of the coming spending deadline in September if Congress does not fund his border wall and change the nation's immigration laws.

"I would be willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!" Trump tweeted.

I would be willing to "shut down" government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!

Trump's Twitter threat introduced a fresh wild card for congressional negotiators to deal with as the remaining legislative days tick down before government funding runs out -- an explosive prospect for both parties with just 100 days until the midterm elections. The warning also comes as Trump fac

Trump has previously floated the possibility of a government shutdown over border security and immigration, and on Sunday he made his threat explicit, saying he would do so unless Congress funds his proposed wall, which he promised Mexico would pay for, and puts in place his preferred immigration policies.

In May, Trump suggested "closing up the country for a while" if he did not get his wall.

"They don't want the wall," Trump said. "But we're going to get the wall, even if we have to think about closing up the country for a while."

Sunday's shutdown threat from Trump also echoed a remark he made in February when he said "I'd love to see a shutdown" if the government did not agree to address immigration.

"I said to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again," Trump said in March.

A shutdown over Trump's wall at the September deadline would mark the third lapse in appropriations this year, following a shutdown in January as Democrats battled with the Trump administration and congressional Republicans on protections for "Dreamers" as well as a brief shutdown when Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky blocked a spending vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced in June that he was canceling much of the Senate's August recess, saying the chamber needed the additional time to make progress on Trump's nominees and pass appropriations bills. And with the House out on August recess, there's not much time left before the deadline that both chambers will be in session.

Both Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and McConnell met with Trump last week to discuss funding the government.

Asked about Trump's Twitter threat, a pair of Republican lawmakers said Sunday that they didn't think the government should or would shut down this September.

"Let's hope not," Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said on CBS's "Face the Nation."

Johnson added that he didn't think a shutdown would be "helpful" to Republicans in the November elections, "so let's try and avoid it."

Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said on ABC's "This Week" said he did not think it would come to a shutdown.

"I don't think we're going to shut down the government," Stivers said. "You know, I think we're going to make sure we keep the government open, but we're going to get better policies on immigration."

The magazine said Trump was "incorrect" about their process

West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) President Donald Trump tweeted Friday that he turned down a potential offer to be TIME Magazine's coveted "Person of the Year" after, Trump says, the magazine told him he would "probably" be given the honors.

"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named "Man (Person) of the Year" like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot," Trump tweeted from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where is spending his Thanksgiving holiday.

__label__politics At a speech in Kansas City to the VFW annual convention on Tuesday , President Donald Trump -- amid one of his trademark anti-media rants -- said this (emphasis mine):

"Stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening."

I know I keep saying this, BUT: That is an absolutely remarkable thing for any elected leader to say -- especially when that leader is the most powerful person in the country. And I know I keep saying this too, BUT: That the President not only thinks like that but feels emboldened enough to utter it to a crowd of people -- with cameras broadcasting it around the country -- is downright scary.

Go back and read that full quote above. What Trump is saying is this: I (and those who support me) are the only ones telling you the truth. Anything you hear from anyone who is not me is not to be believed.

Holy moly.

This feels to me like a step beyond Trump's long-established willingness to exaggerate and sometimes outright lie in pursuit of his own agenda. Since he became a candidate three years ago, Trump has exhibited a casual relationship with the truth. It's become clear over that time that he is telling himself the story of his own life; whether that version comports with established facts has never been of major concern for the President.

It's a mentality that produces concepts like "alternative facts" -- a belief that truth is itself a fungible concept.

But what Trump did in his VFW speech goes beyond simply saying lots of things that aren't true. (To be clear: He did that too!) He told the audience not to believe anything they see or read. That all media is fake. That everything that doesn't originate with Trump himself should be ignored.

"Mr. Trump, at a pivotal moment in his presidency, is increasingly living in a world of selected information and bending the truth to his own narrative. As his aides work to keep him insulated from the outside world, Mr. Trump is doubling down in his efforts to tell supporters to trust him over the words of critics and news reports."

Defenders of Trump will undoubtedly be buoyed by his latest attack. The media is hopelessly biased against Trump so why shouldn't he tell people to ignore anything the media says -- and so on.

There are a few ways to answer that question.

First, the idea that the media is to blame for Trump's current morass over Russia is farcical. The media didn't decide that Trump should sit down with Putin one-on-one for more than two hours in Helsinki. The media didn't dictate that Trump was unwilling to blame Russia for their election meddling in 2016. The media didn't botch Trump's repeated attempts to clarify whether or not he believes Russia sought to interfere in the last presidential election or whether they had plans to meddle in future elections. Donald Trump did all of those things. He literally said them on camera. All the media did was broadcast it; no analysis necessary.

Second, for those who cheer Trump's call to ignore anything except what he says, ask yourself how that story ends. We know that one of the hallmarks of authoritarian governments is an attempt to discredit the independent media and then seize control of the press so that only approved messages are aired or written. No matter how much you hate CNN -- or me! -- you can't believe that a government-controlled media is a better alternative,

What's even more terrifying about all of this is that Trump's message of un-reality is picked up and amplified by the primetime lineup at Fox News Channel. And Fox is, of course, the way that many conservatives in the country get their news. Fox is, of course, riding high in the ratings thanks to their willingness to parrot Trump's message to an audience waiting eagerly to hear it.

But, again, follow that path to its logical conclusion: At some point not even Fox would be good enough for Trump. The likes of Chris Wallace and Bret Baier, Fox anchors still committed to asking hard questions of the administration, would be deemed unacceptable. Any criticism -- or even analysis -- of an idea or statement from Trump would be seen as a betrayal. Fox wouldn't be Trumpy enough for Trump.

That's where the sort of rhetoric Trump is using ends -- in the obliteration of even the approximation of a free and independent media. So if you cheer when Trump tells you to ignore what your own eyes and ears are telling you, think about what you are applauding. My guess is it's not the kind of society you would want to live in -- or want to leave for your children.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday denied a motion to dismiss portions of a lawsuit alleging that President Donald Trump, through his Trump International Hotel in DC and the Trump Organization, violated a constitutional clause banning gifts or advantages from foreign and domestic governments.

In his opinion, Judge Peter Messitte of the US District Court of Maryland largely sided with Maryland and Washington, DC's definition of emolument as an "advantage." Trump was arguing for a more restrictive definition of the term as a "gift."

Department of Justice spokesman Andy Reuss said the department is reviewing the judge's order.

"We continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed, a position that was shared by a New York court in a related case. The Justice Department is reviewing the order and determining next steps to continue vigorously defending the President," Reuss said.

Maryland and Washington, DC, have argued that the Trump International Hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the Trump Hotel got special tax concessions.

__label__world (CNN) Here's some background information about Hinduism, the world's third largest religion after Christianity and Islam . "Hinduism" is derived from a Sanskrit word that means "dwellers by the Indus River."

Beliefs/Practices:

There is no single founder or founding incident of Hinduism. It grew out of cultural and religious changes in India.

The Hindu belief is that gods or divinities can take many forms, but all form one universal spirit called Brahman. The three most important representations of Brahman are Brahma, the creator of the universe, Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, and Shiva, the destroyer of the universe.

The Hindu belief involves reincarnation of the soul, which is rebirth after death. Hindus believe the conditions of one's present life are due to karma, or accumulated good or bad behavior in past lives.

One improves one's conditions through good behavior and creates suffering for oneself through bad behavior. Eventually the soul will achieve moksha, or salvation, and stop the cycle of rebirths to become a part of the absolute soul.

Paths to salvation are called the margas or yogas.

- karma marga - performing social obligations and offering selfless service.

- jnana marga - studying and cultivating an intellectual understanding into one's identity with Brahman.

- bhakti marga - devotion to one's personal god.

- raja or dhyana marga - not as widely recognized as the three outlined in the Bhagavad Gita, this path uses meditation to gain insight into the absolute soul that resides within one's self.

There are multiple sects, theologies, and beliefs in Hinduism, and there is no single book of doctrine, but many. It is an inclusive religious group, allowing for a lot of diversity.

The Vedas are the primary literary works, containing sacred verses and hymns composed in Sanskrit and took on their current form around 1500 BC. The Rig Veda was the first of the four Vedas. The Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda followed later.

Two other important texts are the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.

Pilgrimages and festivals are common in Hinduism. Diwali, the New Year's celebration , features giving of gifts and lighting of ceremonial lamps. Holi, the Festival of Colors, marks the arrival of spring each year.

Caste System:

Indian society has traditionally been divided into a hierarchical system called caste or jati, which is not limited to Hindus, but which most Hindus have observed throughout history. It is hereditary and each caste has its own set of values, rules, dietary beliefs, etc. Many do not marry outside their castes.

There are four major varnas or social classes most caste members fall into:

- Brahmans - the priests and other educated professionals.

- Kshatriyas - warriors and those who own a lot of land.

- Vaishyas - formerly the farmers, now those involved in commerce; merchants.

- Shudras (some sources say Sudra) - the lowest of the social classes. Made up of laborers, artisans, and other servants.

There are some that do not fall into any of these categories, and they are now considered part of the Scheduled Caste. They are lower than the Shudras on the hierarchy, and they are people who perform "unclean" work, such as leather working and street cleaning. They have been called untouchables, Dalits, Harijans or backward castes. Although Hinduism teaches that discrimination and prejudice go against the idea of the divinity of all beings, both sometimes exist within the caste system.

Mahatma Gandhi called these untouchables "children of God." Although the 1950 Indian constitution outlawed "untouchability," violence against them continues.

History:

2300-1500 BC - A very developed civilization dwells in the Indus Valley with its own religion and culture, and is believed to be the beginnings of Hinduism.

1500 BC - Indo-European language and culture spread into the Indus Valley through a mix of trade and migration and mingle with the practices and beliefs of the inhabitants of the area.

1500-1200 BC - The Rig Veda is written and is composed of 1,028 hymns devoted to the gods.

800-600 BC - The Brahmans are written and added to the Vedas. They are prose writings that explain certain ceremonies found in the Vedas.

600 BC - The belief in reincarnation develops.

300-650 AD - The worship of images, especially female divinities, becomes common.

800-1800 AD - The most divisive period. Many different schools and sects emerge, and Islam becomes a major influence in India.

1947 - British India is split into what is now India and British India is split into what is now India and Pakistan . Hinduism is now the major religion of India.

__label__politics (CNN) Christine Hallquist's bid to become the country's first transgender governor will clear an historic hurdle on Tuesday.

Hallquist will win the Democratic primary in Vermont, CNN projects, becoming the first transgender gubernatorial nominee for a major political party, a breakthrough of both substantial and symbolic importance for LGBTQ Americans, in particular the trans community, which has for so long been shut out of the highest levels of elected office.

In an interview with CNN's Don Lemon on Tuesday night, Hallquist said the result didn't surprise her and noted Vermont's progressive record on civil rights issues. But like so many Democrats in 2018, she also pointed to Washington, DC, and President Donald Trump as her reason for jumping into a political campaign for the first time.

"There's a systematic attack and it's going to start with the most marginalized of the communities, so the fact that our President has gone after the transgender community is no surprise and I think everybody should be afraid," Hallquist told Lemon.

She also cast the current upheaval as an opportunity for new voices to emerge and reshape the conversation.

__label__world (CNN) Meghan Markle's father, Thomas Markle, has reportedly said he will not attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry, prompting speculation over who will walk her down the aisle on Saturday.

It's the latest in a series of challenges for the royal couple who announced their engagement last November, and are due to tie in the knot in front of a worldwide audience at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.

From controversy over the photos to racist online abuse, here are the issues Meghan and Harry have had to deal with on their way to the aisle.

Photo fiasco

The problem of Markle's father's no-show arose Monday when he said he wouldn't be attending due to embarrassment over a series of staged photographs.

A British newspaper revealed that her father had worked with a picture agency to take photos of him preparing himself for the wedding.

Thomas Markle said he now thought the pictures were "stupid and hammy," according to a TMZ report, and that he made the decision to skip the wedding so he wouldn't embarrass the royal family or his daughter.

Markle's half-sister, Samantha, told a British TV network on Monday that she urged their father to stage the photos for the paparazzi to help improve his image.

The decision to bail out of the wedding has sparked a firestorm of interest over who will walk Markle down the aisle. Those mooted to take over his role include Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and Prince William.

Prince Charles, Meghan's future father-in-law, may be the most obvious choice to replace her father. But Prince William has spent more time with the bride and therefore may fit the bill, adding to his job as Prince Harry's best man.

But Ragland is perhaps most likely to take on the task, given her particularly close relationship with her daughter.

Tabloid fodder

This is not the first blot on couple's weddings plans. Markle's previous relationships and marriage, and her heritage -- her mother is African American and her father is Caucasian -- have attracted the interest of the British press.

The Sun described her as a "brunette" and a "break from the mould for Prince Harry, who has previously dated a string of blondes".

But the Daily Mail went further and displayed more prejudice, playing on stereotypes of African Americans. In a story headlined "Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton," it reported Markle's mother lives in a "run-down area" in Crenshaw, Los Angeles."

It described the neighborhood as "gang-scarred" and dominated by "tatty one-storey homes."

Racist hate crimes

Markle has also had to contend with racial abuse. In February British police investigated a package reportedly addressed to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who is bi-racial, as a "racist hate crime ."

The Metropolitan Police said that officers tested a substance in a package received at St James's Palace, which the London Evening Standard said was a white powder. Other UK media reports said the package also contained a racist letter.

Markle has also been hounded online. Politician Paul Nehlen posted a photoshopped image of Markle with the head of Cheddar Man, whose 9,000-year-old remains indicate the dark-skinned man was an ancient Briton. Along with the image, he tweeted: "Honey does this tie make my face look pale?"

Twitter banned the Republican congressional candidate from Wisconsin for what a company representative called "repeated violations of our terms of service".

The issue of racism was also raised after Princess Michael of Kent apologized after coming under fire for wearing a controversial Blackamoor brooch to a Buckingham Palace lunch attended by Markle.

Blackamoor, a decorative style that depicts African people as exoticized figures, is widely considered offensive. Media reports showing Princess Michael wearing the brooch prompted Twitter users to label her at worst overtly racist and at best out of touch.

Public smears

The media compared Markle to Wallis Simpson, the divorced American whose relationship with King Edward VIII led to his abdication in 1936. Also widely discussed are Markle's "racy" and "fruity" scenes in Suits, her Instagram posts, her mother and the fact that she is three years older than Harry.

In November 2016, Prince Harry warned the media against harassing Markle in a rare statement issued by Kensington Palace.

"His girlfriend Meghan Markle has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public -- the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments," read the statement, which was issued by Prince Harry's communications secretary through the palace Twitter account.

Who's invited?

The couple also ran into controversy over their guest list, which did not include US President Donald Trump nor his predecessor Barack Obama.

Kensington Palace announced that the royal couple would not be inviting political leaders to the event, at least not on the basis of their official position.

There had been speculation in the UK media that British officials feared the political consequences if the couple decide to invite Barack and Michelle Obama, with whom they are friends, but not Donald Trump, who Markle has criticized as "divisive" and "misogynistic."

__label__world (CNN) An independent United Nations investigation into alleged human rights abuses carried out against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar has called for the country's military leaders to be investigated and prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The damning report contains allegations of murder, imprisonment and sexual violence against the Rohingyas, carried out by the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, under the guise of a crackdown on terrorists, and against a backdrop of impunity that effectively placed military leaders above the law.

"Military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages. The Tatmadaw's tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine State, but also in northern Myanmar," the report said.

The report recommends the case be referred to the International Criminal Court in the Hague, or for an ad hoc tribunal to be created to investigate the actions of the alleged perpetrators. Six military leaders are named in the report, including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Referring to the unusual step of naming the alleged perpetrators in the report, mission member Radhika Coomaraswamy told the media in Geneva on Monday morning that they had found "such overwhelming evidence" of wrongdoing and that the command had "such effective control from what we could gather that we could name ... who was responsible."

The names of others thought to culpable have been "put in an envelope" and will be given to the Human Rights Commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, she said.

"There are people we're very sure should be investigated."

Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar Commander In-Chief (L) and National League for Democracy (NLD) party leader Aung San Suu Kyi (R) shake hands after a meeting in Naypyidaw on December 2, 2015.

UN investigators found that the Myanmar's civilian government had "contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes" through their "acts and omissions."

"The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine State," the report states.

Members of the misson said that the international community's involvement in the process is important, and that the country could not be expected to hold its military to account.

Given "abusive military conduct going back half a century," and the "complete impunity of military commanders (and the) almost complete immunity given to troops," expecting justice from domestic processes was "simply naive," Christopher Sidoti, a member of the mission, said at a news conference.

A number of humanitarian organizations, including Amnesty International and Save the Children, backed the UN's recommendation that Myanmar be referred to the International Criminal Court.

"The international community needs to send a firm signal to all perpetrators, including the Myanmar military, that crimes of this magnitude will not be allowed to pass unaccounted for," said Michael McGrath, country director in Myanmar for Save the Children.

Mass exodus

Last August, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims started fleeing across the border into Bangladesh into what's since become the world's biggest refugee camp. Many of those who crossed the border have recounted horrific stories of being driven from their homes under threat of death.

Myanmar's military has repeatedly denied that it has deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya. Instead, the authorities insist that it only targets Rohingya militants, mostly from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group, which has launched deadly attacks on police posts.

"There is no evidence that Myanmar soldiers committed any human rights violations in their response to the ARSA terrorist attacks of 2017. We have recently formed a new independent commission, which will investigate alleged rights abuses in Rakhine State including rape. We will treat any case in accordance with the rule of law," Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Myanmar's presidential office told CNN earlier in August.

Despite being barred access to the affected regions, investigators conducted 875 interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, and examined satellite images and forensic and other documentary evidence.

Mission chairman Marzuki Darusman said it believes "there is hope for Myanmar," and that the investigation was undertaken as the "first stepping stone for change.

"Without the truth, Myanmar will not be able to ensure a stable and prosperous future for its people," he said, adding that its "transition into a democratic state has barely begun."

Systematic campaign

The report by the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concludes that human rights violations in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states "undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law."

In the past, the United Nations has called the alleged campaign of violence, including mass killings, rape and the burning of Rohingya villages by Myanmar government forces a " textbook example of ethnic cleansing ," while UN Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee has said that the attacks bear the "hallmarks of genocide."

The report says the actions of the military compare to previous examples of genocide.

"The crimes in Rakhine State, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts," it says, including "policies... to alter the demographic composition of Rakhine State; the level of organization indicating a plan for destruction; and the extreme scale and brutality of the violence."

"Like almost all circumstances of genocide, there is no smoking gun," said Sidoti at Monday's press conference, adding that there was "no doubt in our minds whatsoever that what we saw happen in Rakhine" would not have happened without the knowledge and control of the country's highest military figures.

The report also highlighted the role of hate speech spread on social media platforms, including Facebook, in the violence perpetrated in Myanmar.

In response to the report, Facebook announced Monday that it is banning 20 individuals and organizations from the platform, including Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and removing more than 50 Facebook pages, most of which were allegedly "covertly push(ing) the messages of the Myanmar military."

What happens next?

The crime of genocide has never been tried at the International Criminal Court, which was established in 2002 as the world's first permanent war crimes court.

Complicating matters further is that Myanmar is not a member state of the court and the ICC therefore does not have automatic jurisdiction there.

Perpetrators of genocides in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda have been convicted through ad hoc tribunals -- the second option suggested in the UN report -- but these have often taken many years to conclude.

Either recommendation in Monday's report is likely to result in a years-long process, with no guarantee of a conviction.

But with the events being officially described as genocide for the first time, dozens of countries are now legally compelled to take action. All states that have ratified the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide pledged to "undertake to prevent and punish" genocide when they signed.

Those states include the UK, Canada, Australia and the US.

'Terrorist activities'

Once seen as a defender of human rights, Myanmar state counsellor Suu Kyi has been heavily criticized for her failure to act as the scale of the attacks against the Rohingya emerged.

Speaking on August 21 following a lecture in Singapore, Suu Kyi again reiterated the government's claim that "terrorist activities" remain a threat in Rakhine state that has to be addressed.

"The danger of terrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine, remains real and present today. Unless this security challenge is addressed, the risk of inter-communal violence will remain," she said.

The refugees languishing in camps in Bangladesh are set to be sent home under a repatriation agreement made between Myanmar and Bangladesh. However, the timing of their return is uncertain.

__label__world New Delhi (CNN) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's first official visit to India is generating plenty of publicity, but for all the wrong reasons.

Though the Canadian leader is more than halfway through a week-long trip, he has yet to meet with a single senior member of the Indian government, sparking widespread speculation he has been "snubbed" by New Delhi.

Trudeau landed in India along with his wife and three children on Saturday, beginning a winding tour across the country that has so far seen the family pictured at the Taj Mahal and wearing traditional dress at Mahatma Gandhi's ashram in the western state of Gujarat.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with his wife and three children, arrive in New Delhi on February 17.

Missing from the picture at any of these locations, as well as during the family's initial arrival in Delhi, is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"The optics don't look good," said Vivek Dehejia, a senior fellow at Mumbai-based think tank IDFC Institute.

"All you can see are the Lonely Planet-style pictures of his family at the Taj Mahal and in Gujarat, but he's not had a single official event."

Modi is known for his hugging diplomacy. He is pictured in awkward bear hugs with leaders including both former and current US Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

Trudeau's visit, in particular, is playing in stark contrast with the recent visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who just last month was greeted with a hug by Modi immediately upon landing in Delhi.

All this "is creating a perception that this a lower-level relationship, that this is a less important relationship to India," said Dehejia, who is also an economics professor at Carleton University in Canada.

Speculation mounts

Trudeau is in town at the same time as Donald Trump Jr ., the son of US President Trump, who is in India on a private visit to promote real estate deals across four cities.

The two trips have drawn comparisons online, with analysts watching carefully to see whether the arrival of Trump Jr., who holds no official government title, is afforded more attention than that of the Canadian Prime Minister.

Speaking to CNN, India's former ambassador to Canada Vishnu Prakash refuted suggestions that Trudeau was being ignored, describing the situation as "a storm in a teacup."

"I'm a little puzzled frankly, by the basis of which this is being said, there's no departure from protocol," said Prakash, adding that Trudeau is an "esteemed guest."

Trudeau has also dismissed the concerns, telling a Canadian news channel that he met Modi "very recently."

According to an official agenda released by the Indian government Trudeau is due to meet with Modi on Friday in Delhi.

But that hasn't stopped speculation in local media in both India and Canada linking Trudeau's reception -- or lack thereof -- to the issue of Sikh separatists.

Canada is home to about 468,000 Sikhs, comprising 1.4% of its population. A small but influential number of those Sikhs support the idea of Khalistan, or the demand for a separate state for Indian Sikhs.

The separatist issue goes back decades in India, with one of the most important clashes occurring in 1984 when Indian Army soldiers stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhs' holiest site, in an effort to capture separatist leaders. In response, two Sikh bodyguards assassinated India's then leader, Indira Gandhi.

In 1985 the violence spilled over into Canada, when Sikh separatists bombed an Air India plane that had taken off from Toronto airport, killing all 329 people aboard, including numerous Canadians of Indian descent. The only person who was convicted in the bombing was released in 2017 by Canadian courts after serving two decades in jail.

Analysts point to Trudeau's appearance at a Sikh event in Toronto last year, where separatist flags and posters depicting an extremist Sikh leader killed in the 1984 Indian Army operation were displayed, as a particular area of contention.

"That is certainly a matter of greater concern because it goes to the core of India's unity and integrity and that is an issue that needs to be sorted out between the two countries," said Prakash, who described the event Trudeau attended as "an out and out Khalistani platform."

The Trudeau family stands silhouetted in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra on February 18.

Speaking to CNN, Dhruva Jaishankar, a fellow at Delhi-based think tank Brookings India, agreed that Modi's apparent cold shouldering of Trudeau was significant.

"This is quite clearly a strong signal that India is very unhappy with the Trudeau government for its approach to this (separatist) issue," said Jaishankar, though he cautioned that the relationship was "multifaceted" and operated on many levels.

More than a million members of India's diaspora live in Canada and the two countries have maintained longstanding cooperative agreements in sectors ranging from energy security to education. Trade between the two countries stood at an estimated $6 billion in 2016.

Two stalled trade agreements -- one on fair trade and one on foreign investments -- have been under negotiation since 2010, and hopes had been high that Trudeau's visit would help to push those talks forward.
__label__politics (CNN) Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, said Monday he is still undecided on whether he will support President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, a potential issue for Republican leaders, who have little room for GOP defections.

"I'm still undecided," Paul said. "I'm going to meet with him tomorrow."

With a narrow majority and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain back home fighting cancer , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can't afford to lose a single Republican vote without convincing Democrats to cross the aisle and vote for the conservative nominee.

Paul plans to meet with Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, when he will ask him specifically about his record on issues related to privacy and his time in the DC circuit as it related to cases involving the Fourth Amendment.

"The Fourth Amendment was intended to limit government in all ways, and if the government couldn't say, 'Oh, well, we just need to come in your house anytime so we can be safe from terrorism,' that's very worrisome. And so we're gonna have some discussion about that," Paul said.

__label__politics (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cut a deal with Democratic leaders in the upper chamber to clear a slate of President Donald Trump's nominees, one of the top August priorities for the Kentucky Republican.

The deal, which permitted 11 nominees to be cleared immediately and another eight to be voted on next week, also will allow senators who missed most of their August recess to go home for a couple of days before many come back at the end of the week to say farewell to their colleague Sen. John McCain, who died last Saturday.

McConnell had canceled the August recess after being pushed by restive conservatives in his caucus to stay in session to approve Trump's picks and make progress on oft-delayed spending bills.

Many senators hoped the threat would be short-lived but after liberal Democrats bottled up the nominees and refused to relent, McConnell was forced to take time-consuming procedural steps to overcome the filibusters.

There is little the minority Democrats can do on their own to stop the nominees, because only a simple majority is needed for them to be confirmed. But Democrats were able to delay OK'ing some of the nominees at least until next week.

"They were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, 'Treasonous.' I mean, yeah, I guess, why not," he said to laughter.

"Can we call that treason? Why not," he added. He made the remarks during a speech at a manufacturing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio.

"I mean they certainly didn't seem to love our country that much," he said, adding it was "very, very sad."

Trump's comments came less than a week after he delivered his State of the Union address in which he preached the virtue of bipartisanship.

__label__politics (CNN) Judge Brett Kavanaugh two years ago expressed his desire to overturn a three-decade-old Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of an independent counsel, a comment bound to get renewed scrutiny in his confirmation proceedings to sit on the high court.

Speaking to a conservative group in 2016, Kavanaugh bluntly said he wanted to "put the final nail" in a 1988 Supreme Court ruling. That decision, known as Morrison v. Olson, upheld the constitutionality of provisions creating an independent counsel under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act -- the same statute under which Ken Starr, for whom Kavanaugh worked, investigated President Bill Clinton. The law expired in 1999, when it was replaced by the more modest Justice Department regulation that governs special counsels like Robert Mueller.

The comments are certain to get new attention amid his confirmation proceedings given that President Donald Trump and his campaign remain under investigation by Mueller -- and alongside the skepticism Kavanaugh previously expressed over whether a sitting president can be indicted.

Whether that means Kavanaugh views Mueller's appointment and investigation itself as unconstitutional is unclear, given the special counsel works directly for the Justice Department under a different set of rules that governed the independent counsel.

Yet the 2016 remarks, which have not been previously reported, are consistent with Kavanaugh's judicial record expressing disdain for the Morrison ruling.

Asked at an American Enterprise Institute event in March 2016 if he could think of a case that deserved to be overturned, Kavanaugh said: "Yes." Asked if he could specify a case, Kavanaugh first responded: "No," prompting laughter from the audience.

He then volunteered this: "Actually, I'm going to say one. Morrison v. Olson. It's been effectively overruled, but I would put the final nail in," according to a video of the event.

There are important differences between the regulation governing Mueller and the independent counsel law. Unlike the independent counsel, Mueller reports directly to the Justice Department, and has less independence. But the special counsel cannot be removed without "good cause" under regulations that may withstand legal scrutiny because of the Morrison decision.

At the core of the 1988 ruling is the idea that Congress can create an independent investigative mechanism within the executive branch and insulate that investigation from direct control by the President -- by preventing the removal of the independent counsel except for good cause. Although a court of appeals panel had struck down the independent counsel law, the Supreme Court upheld it, concluding that it was not inconsistent with the separation of powers for Congress to create such a check on the President.

But conservatives like Kavanaugh have long celebrated the solo dissent of the late Justice Antonin Scalia from that ruling -- and the "unitary executive" theory it embraces, under which it is argued that it is unconstitutional for any executive branch officer to be insulated from presidential control.

If Kavanaugh provided a fifth vote for overturning the Morrison case, it could have implications for the Mueller probe, according to legal experts. While the independent counsel law expired in 1999, the regulations governing Mueller's appointment as a special counsel, like the independent counsel law itself, prohibit Mueller from being fired without good cause.

It's uncertain whether Kavanaugh's hostility to the Morrison case means that he would view Mueller's appointment itself as unconstitutional -- or if he simply believes that Mueller could be fired for any or no reason.

This distinction could be crucial if, among other things, the Supreme Court ultimately rules on a subpoena forcing Trump to testify in the Mueller investigation. Moreover, his views also could mean he'd be skeptical of legislation approved in April by the Senate Judiciary Committee that would make it even harder for Mueller to be removed without good cause.

Legal experts say Kavanaugh has expressed his distaste for the Morrison ruling in several opinions. Taken with his legal writings expressing skepticism that a sitting president can be indicted, experts say Kavanaugh could be a voice on the court pushing back on investigations of a president.

"His views of the President's constitutional authority would call into question at least some of the means through which a sitting president can be investigated," said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and CNN Supreme Court analyst. "There's no question other investigative avenues remain, especially through Congress. But the 'unitary executive' theory that Judge Kavanaugh has so often embraced is difficult to reconcile with even a somewhat-independent prosecutor within the executive branch who doesn't serve at the pleasure of the President."

Vladeck added: "The more important question is whether there would be four other votes to go along with him."

The White House declined to comment.

Kavanaugh's views are undoubtedly shaped by his experience working with Starr from 1994-1998, as Starr served as the independent counsel investigating the Clinton White House. Kavanaugh later worked in the Bush White House, including as an associate counsel from 2001-2003 and as a staff secretary from 2003-2006 before being confirmed for a seat on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

In a 2009 Minnesota Law Review article, Kavanaugh detailed his concerns about indicting a sitting president, saying his views had changed over the issue since the 1980s and 1990s.

"Having seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is, I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible," he wrote. "The country wants the President to be 'one of us' who bears the same responsibilities of citizenship that all share. But I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office."

Kavanaugh's confirmation prospects hinge on a handful of moderate Senate Republicans and Democrats, who are keeping their powder dry until after they meet with him and after his confirmation hearings.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley told CNN Tuesday it's still unclear when confirmation hearings will be held, or whether they'll occur before September, saying that the panel needs to review a wide swath of documents, including from his time at the Bush White House.

Grassley said there are "roughly millions" of pages of documents, but he signaled he was not going to ask for every single of one of them, as Democrats have demanded. He expected document production to occur on a rolling basis.

"You could probably get them all if you want to take a year to do it," Grassley said. "But obviously, you're going to only ask for what's relevant."

Among the biggest questions Kavanaugh is bound to face: Whether he'd respect Supreme Court precedent. During the March 2016 event, Kavanaugh addressed that as well, noting that not all precedent should be considered settled law.

"I think justices of all stripes agree that stare decisis is important, but not an inexorable command," he said. "It's not absolute. And if it were, you would have some horrible decisions still on the books," citing Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld segregation on the basis of race.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The private prison industry -- one of the most controversial pieces of the US carceral state -- has essentially recovered a year after the Obama administration sent a chill down its spine.

Last August, then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates issued a memo calling on the Department of Justice to begin curtailing its use of private prisons -- incarceration run by for-profit companies.

Stocks for one of the two major publicly traded prison companies nosedived, and with a presidential victory for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton widely expected, the Yates memo seemed to indicate the heyday for the private prison industry had passed.

But the impact of the decision was not lasting.

On November 8, Trump won the presidency, and just days into the job, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded Yates' guidance.

The private prison industry saw stock prices soar for months after the election even relative to the already robust stock market.

And one year ago Friday, from that now-rescinded memo, the situation for these prisons looks largely like what it was before the Obama-era Justice Department sought to change the status quo.

The controversy

Critics of private prisons contend they are inefficient and inhumane.

When she issued her memo, Yates cited a government watchdog report that said private prisons were generally more expensive and offered worse results. Groups such as the ACLU lauded the report and Yates' decision while the private prison industry reeled. It called the report imbalanced and challenged its comparison of private and public facilities.

Alexander "Sasha" Volokh, an Emory University law professor and supporter of private prisons, told CNN the report was faulty.

"It's hard to do a good study that really compares them well," Volokh said, citing the differences in prison populations and lack of reliable performance measures.

The other major strain of criticism comes from the profit motive, the argument that a for-profit carceral facility will necessarily seek to cut corners and increase the number of people behind bars.

Volokh said issues with performance in private prisons could be corrected with stronger contracts and that the government could use the profit motive to its advantage by making companies compete for results. He also pointed out political efforts by labor unions for public-sector prison guards, arguing those had a much stronger impact on mass incarceration than for-profit companies.

Critics have contended otherwise, pointing to overcrowding among many other reported abuses and political efforts by the companies to back tough-on-crime candidates.

"Profit should not play a role in the criminal justice system," said Udi Ofer, deputy national political director for the ACLU.

Ofer also said profit found its way into other corners of the criminal justice system besides prison privatization, like the multibillion-dollar bail industry, which has in some places found bipartisan opposition.

Meanwhile, Sessions, in his memo rolling back the Obama-era policy, said curtailing the use of private prisons "impaired the bureau's ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system."

Following years of relatively low crime rates and the more recent dip in the prison population, Sessions has pushed for a crackdown on drug and gun offenses and offered a wholesale endorsement of Trump's "law-and-order" campaign.

The companies

When it comes to private prisons in the US, the two biggest names are CoreCivic -- the new name for the Corrections Corporation of America -- and GEO Group. Management & Training Corporation, another company with prison operations, is not publicly traded.

While CoreCivic and GEO Group have, for the time being, seen a halt to their massive surges since the election, both in their second quarter earnings calls said they expected more federal contracts as the departments of Justice and Homeland Security detain more people.

Both companies welcomed the Trump era with large donations.

In January, GEO Group's Pablo Paez, the company's vice president of corporate relations, told USA Today it donated $250,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. OpenSecrets ' list of inauguration donors noted the GEO Group donation, as well as CoreCivic's $250,000 contribution.

The month before the election, GEO Group hired two former Sessions aides as lobbyists: David Stewart and Ryan Robichaux, according to Politico.

The Bureau of Prisons renewed two large contracts for GEO Group in May, and CoreCivic said in its second quarter earnings call it expected the Trump administration would mean more contracts for the company.

Private prisons and immigration

Private prison companies overall make up a small share of the incarceration pie, both on the federal and state levels, Justice Department data show. This means while private prisons are significant, they don't account for most of mass incarceration facilities.

A large share of people locked up in federal private facilities are criminal undocumented immigrants, and populations at the local level vary wildly depending on the state. Many states have no private institutions while others contract with these companies for a sizable share of their prisoners.

So when it comes to the Trump administration, these prison contractors are eyeing both criminal law enforcement and immigration. But on both counts, the people going to private prisons paid for by the federal government are largely immigrants.

From Day One of Trump's campaign, he pushed heavily for a crackdown on undocumented immigration, and once in office, Trump ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ramp up its enforcement efforts.

For years, ICE has outsourced the bulk of its detention operations to the private sector.

Last year, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson followed the Justice Department's footsteps by asking his department to look at its own use of private prisons. What resulted was a sweeping assessment of their use and an accounting that showed some 65% of people ICE detained were kept in for-profit facilities.

Despite the standing outcry from civil liberties groups like the ACLU, DHS said its use of private prisons was necessary and voted to continue its existing policies.

ACLU National Prison Project Director David Fathi argued that both the DHS report and Yates' now-rescinded memo were tempered wins for the opponents of private prisons. DHS' vote, he noted, was not unanimous and came with a dissent. And Yates' memo at least showed the ability of a Justice Department -- albeit one with different ideological leadership -- to phase out private prisons.

"Once the bell is rung, it can never be unrung," Fathi said.

The new wording amends the party's charter requirement that all committees and like bodies be divided equally between men and women to account for members who don't identify with either gender.

The language now says committees "shall be as equally divided as practicable between men and women (determined by gender self-identification) meaning that the variance between men and women in the group cannot exceed one (1)."

Gender nonbinary members will not be counted as either male or female, "and the remainder of the delegation shall be equally divided."

"At the root of our diverse party is a commitment to inclusion and opportunity," DNC Chair Tom Perez said in a statement to CNN. "By adopting this amendment, the Democratic National Committee is ensuring every Democrat feels welcome and embraced for who they are. This action reaffirms our solidarity with the LGBTQ community and challenges governments, employers, and organizations across the country to do the same."

__label__politics McAllen, Texas (CNN) First lady Melania Trump touched down in McAllen, Texas, Thursday for a publicly unannounced and hastily planned trip to get a firsthand look at the crisis affecting immigrant families at the US border.

"I want to thank you for your hard work, your compassion and your kindness," the first lady said at a roundtable briefing at Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter, with doctors and medical staff, social workers and other experts on hand.

"She wants to see what's real," the first lady's spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN during a news briefing en route to Texas, explaining Trump's decision to visit.

Trump becomes the first member of the President's inner circle to personally witness the situation that has captured the country's attention. Something else that grabbed attention: the jacket the first lady donned as she left Washington.

She wore an olive green jacket, which said on the back: "I really don't care. Do U?" in white graffiti-style lettering. Trump was not wearing the jacket when she landed in McAllen.

The $39 jacket is last season Zara.

The first lady's team said there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice.

"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe," Grisham said.

Touring in Texas

The facility opened to the first lady was of course selected keeping in mind press would be accompanying her. Other such facilities around the country have denied access to Democratic lawmakers and media.

While photos and audio from the unfolding crisis on the border have shown tender age children crying for their parents, Trump, CNN and other members of the media were at a facility with children aged 12-17. The portion of the trip designed to show a family processing facility was canceled due to severe flash flooding in the area.

Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter, part of Lutheran Social Services of the South, is a Department of Health and Human services-overseen facility, which operates with the assistance of HHS funding.

Trump was greeted by Upbring CEO Dr. Kurt Senske, who outlined Upbring's five markers of success: safety, life skills, health, education and vocation. The facility opened in 2014 and currently houses 55 children. Of the children -- 27 boys and 28 girls -- approximately 10% arrived in the United States with their families and have since been separated.

Trump, during a roundtable with officials, asked how often the children speak to their families by telephone, how they are emotionally cared for on arrival and on average how long they stay at the facility before being placed elsewhere.

The first lady stopped to visit with children in three separate classrooms during her tour.

"Where are you from?" she asked several of the kids, along with "How old are you?" and "Have you made friends?"

The children answered, some via a teacher translating from Spanish to English.

The children are "usually distraught" when they arrive, Trump was told by officials, but "when they see the environment, they start relaxing."

Basic needs are taken care of -- showers, clothing, food, medical care.

"The first 24 hours are crucial," a staff member told the first lady.

How children are processed

JUST WATCHED Melania Trump weighs in on immigration Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Melania Trump weighs in on immigration 00:59

An administration official briefing the media before the visit said most children at an HHS-funded and regulated facility such as this one remain there for approximately 58 days, receiving medical, dental, vision and psychological care, as well as what the official described as the ability to be inside a "safe and happy environment."

The official emphasized the predominant mission at this stage of the process, for unaccompanied children is to place them back with appropriate sponsors. Those sponsors can be their parents, if the parents are not involved in the judicial or criminal process or they can be other approved family members already living inside the United States.

If neither of those options is possible, which is the case in about 10% of the unaccompanied children, they are placed with vetted foster families or volunteers.

All of this information was something the first lady wanted to learn in person, said Grisham, who told the media Trump informed her staff -- and her husband, President Donald Trump -- that she had decided she needed to see for herself the family intake and unaccompanied children facilities.

The facilities have dominated the news for days on end, causing heated political battles from the White House to Capitol Hill, ricocheting around the world in an uproar of disbelief and consternation.

A readout of the trip from the White House on Thursday night included this statement from the first lady:

"Today's visit impacted me greatly. I was very impressed with the center and the hardworking staff and leadership there -- and thank them for all of their hard work. The children were eager to learn and were kind and in good spirits. Spending time with them reinforces the fact that these kids are in this situation as a direct result of adult actions. It is my hope that Members of Congress will finally reach across the aisle and work together to solve this problem with common sense immigration reform that secures our borders and keeps families together."

How it came together

" 'I'm headed down to Texas,' " is what Grisham said the first lady told her husband, and "he was supportive."

Grisham confirmed the trip would have taken place whether or not the President had signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to stop the separations.

"This was 100% her idea," said Grisham of Trump's decision to travel to McAllen, making clear the first lady is not on a mission assigned by the President nor is she acting as his emissary. "She wanted to come down."

The first lady intends to inform the President of what she sees.

"She will continue to update her husband," said Grisham, confirming what was reported first Wednesday by CNN, that the first lady had been lobbying the President behind the scenes, encouraging him to stop the separation of children as swiftly as possible, either via legislative process or executive power.

The latter was ultimately the route the President chose, in a stunning reversal of his previous rhetoric.

"As with many topics she will continue to give her husband her opinions," Grisham said.

Like most of the country, the first lady has been watching media reports about children taken from their parents and placed in holding facilities.

It is unclear what, exactly, Trump intends to accomplish from this visit to Texas, outside of seeing firsthand what is happening.

Since becoming first lady, Trump has said she wants to champion helping children, yet has been for the most part vague about how exactly she intends to accomplish her goal. In May, Trump unveiled her "Be Best" platform, which outlined three predominant avenues of focus: health and well-being; kindness and safety online, and highlighting the effects of the opioid crisis on children and families.
__label__world (CNN) Japan looks set to beef up its military budget for the seventh year in a row under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the face of a rising threat from North Korea and an expanding China.

In a budget draft approved Friday, the Japanese government raised military spending by 2.1% to 5.2 trillion yen ($47.6 billion). It will still need to be approved by the Japanese parliament, the Diet, at a later date.

Among the big ticket purchases laid out in the budget are two Aegis Ashore land-based, anti-ballistic missile defense systems, worth $266 million, and six advanced F-35A fighters costing $89.6 million.

Tokyo said the growing defense spending was necessary to cope with an increasingly severe security environment, highlighting North Korea and China specifically in its defense paper published separately on Tuesday and titled "Defense of Japan 2018."

Japan's defense budget still lags far behind that of close ally the United States, which requested $686 billion for 2019, and neighbor China, which increased spending 8.1% to $175 billion in 2018.

The move is in response to Canadian officials accusing Saudi Arabia of human rights violations and demanding the release of activists imprisoned in the kingdom, Saudi Education Ministry spokesman Mubarak al-Osaimi wrote on Twitter.

The Saudi government has said it considers the Canadian position an assault on its sovereignty.

"We will be able to accommodate this number of students in excellent countries such as the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand," Jasser bin Sulaiman Al Harbash, Saudi Arabia's deputy minister of education for scholarship, told state-run television.

This is in addition to suspending training programs and fellowships in Canada, two Saudi Education Ministry officials said.

"We are asking (Tokyo Medical University) to investigate and report as soon as possible how entrance exams have been practiced and if it has been properly done," Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said in a press conference on Friday.

"We will wait for their report and consider how we respond. In general, unjust discriminatory selection of entrants for women is totally unacceptable."

Japan's Education Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi at a press conference in April.

Local newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun first reported on Thursday that the university had allegedly lowered female scores since 2011. An unnamed university source claimed the alleged practice stemmed from a belief that female doctors would leave the profession to get married or give birth, leaving hospitals understaffed.

In 2010, 40% of successful applicants were women, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. Under the alleged rigging, the number dropped to around 30%, the unnamed source told the newspaper. It dipped even lower this year -- women made up 39% of total applicants, but of the students who passed, only 18% were women, according to Tokyo Medical University.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The son of a prominent House Republican blasted his father's role in the saga leading up to FBI agent Peter Strzok's ouster, less than a day after he announced that he was supporting the Democratic candidate to succeed his father.

"I'm deeply embarrassed that Peter Strzok's career was ruined by my father's political grandstanding. That committee hearing was a low point for Congress," Bobby Goodlatte, the son of House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, tweeted Monday. "Thank you for your service sir. You are a patriot."

The FBI deputy director ordered Strzok's termination on Friday, his attorney revealed Monday. The embattled agent had been removed from the special counsel probe into Russian interference last year for sending anti-Donald Trump text messages. Strzok testified before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees in a fiery, nearly 10-hour-long hearing in July.

On Sunday, Bobby Goodlatte voiced his support for the Democrat running for his father's seat and encouraged others to do the same.

"I just gave the maximum allowed donation to Jennifer Lewis, a democrat running for my father's congressional seat," Bobby Goodlatte wrote on Twitter. "I've also gotten 5 other folks to commit to donate the max. 2018 is the year to flip districts — let's do this!"

__label__politics Washington (CNN) There was a simple explanation in October 2017 when a Department of Homeland Security official was asked why a memo justifying ending immigrant protections for Central Americans made conditions in those countries sound so bad.

"The basic problem is that it IS bad there," the official wrote.

Nevertheless, he agreed to go back and see what he could do to better bolster the administration's decision to end the protections regardless.

The revelation comes in a collection of internal emails and documents made public Friday as part of an ongoing lawsuit over the decision to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who live in the US, most of whom have been here for well over a decade.

Friday's document dump come as backup for the attorneys' request that the judge immediately block the government's decision to end these protections as the case is fully heard. A hearing is scheduled for late September.

In the emails, Trump administration political officials repeatedly pushed for the termination of TPS for vulnerable countries, even as they faced pushback from internal assessments by career staffers and other parts of the administration.

In one exchange , the now-director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Francis Cissna, remarks that a document recommending that TPS for Sudan be terminated reads like it was going to recommend the opposite until someone was "clubbed ... over the head."

"The memo reads like one person who strongly supports extending TPS for Sudan wrote everything up to the recommendation section and then someone who opposes extension snuck up behind the first guy, clubbed him over the head, pushed his senseless body of out of the way, and finished the memo. Am I missing something?" he wrote to key DHS staffers. Another high-ranking official then asks for the memo to be "revised."

In a similar exchange , policy adviser Kathy Nuebel Kovarik asks her staff to address what she perceives as inconsistencies in the justification documents for ending TPS for El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.

"The problem is that it reads as though we'd recommend an extension b/c we talk so much about how bad it is, but there's not enough in there about positive steps that have been taken since its designation," she wrote.

Staffer Brandon Prelogar responded that "it IS bad there."

"We can comb through the country conditions to try to see what else there might be, but the basic problem is that it IS bad there (with regards to) all of the standard metrics," Prelogar wrote. "Our strongest argument for termination, we thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly linked to the initial disasters prompting the designations. We can work with RU to try to get more, and/or comb through the country conditions we have again looking for positive gems, but the conditions are what they are."

DHS did end protections for all three countries, despite dire predictions previously reported by CNN from career analysts about the consequences including potentially strengthening the vicious gang MS-13.

Immigrants are suing over the ending of TPS for these countries, alleging the protections were terminated due to a prebaked agenda that violated the law, as well as a racist agenda. The judge has previously allowed the lawsuit to proceed and forced the production of these internal documents, over the objection of the government.

The program covers migrants in the US from countries that have been hit by dire conditions, such as epidemics, civil war or natural disasters. Previous administrations, spanning both parties, had opted to extend the protections for most of the countries involved every few years when they came up for review.

The Trump administration says the conditions in each country have improved from the original disasters to the point that the protected status had to end. DHS has maintained that under its reading of the law, decisions to extend may be based only on conditions from the original disaster -- not any that have arisen since. That breaks with the reading of the law from all prior administrations, attorneys argue -- citing a deposition of a former USCIS director also submitted Friday.

The documents show a gradual process of the front offices of DHS taking more control of the TPS decision making. Early in the administration, career staffers drafted a document that would have justified extending TPS for Haiti. Officials asked that it be changed, and it was initially extended just six months ahead of being terminated completely.

For later decisions, the documents show the State Department complaining that it was marginalized from the process. In fact, a Federal Register Notice for the termination for Sudan had to be pulled back and edited after the State Department complained that it had been changed from a version it had approved at the last minute to something inconsistent with current US policy toward the country.

The emails show that Gene Hamilton, a close ally of Attorney General Jeff Sessions who was a senior counselor at DHS before moving to the Justice Department, made some of those last-minute revisions, attempting to remove references to human rights violations, among other changes.

When presented with Hamilton's changes to some language already agreed to with the State Department, Prelogar wrote that "we'd just say that this could be read as taking another step toward providing an incomplete and lopsided country conditions presentation to support termination, which may increase the likelihood of criticism from external stakeholders to that effect."

The trail also shows the State Department had recommended TPS for Sudan be extended , although it did so late in the game, and that it was caught off-guard by the changes.

In a last-minute email , the State Department's Christopher Ashe wrote to the acting director of USCIS that there were problems.

"The Department has identified some significant mischaracterizations that are at odds with the Department's understanding of circumstances on the ground. We believe that lacking correction, the (Federal Register Notice) could be out of step with the Administration's broader engagement on Sudan -- much of which DHS is not engaged on and is likely unaware of the nuances that USCIS's changes in the language could have," Ashe wrote.

He continued that State was "caught off guard" by a decision to make the announcement.

"We literally were forced to dispatch our Foreign Affairs Officers by taxi to the Embassies with virtually no notice to inform the host governments of the imminent announcements. We had thought we had obtained a commitment for sufficient notice to make such notifications," Ashe wrote.

Nuebel Kovarik responds on the email chain that DHS would reject the suggested change by State that would imply not "all" nationals of Sudan could return, saying it would contradict the decision to terminate. She agrees to change the notice to acknowledge that some regions of Sudan may remain too dangerous for return.

State had asked for that, noting that otherwise it could "encourage the Government of Sudan to believe they have the greenlight from US (government) to force the return of displaced persons ... to return to deadly conflict-affected areas. These areas are places where even well-armed UN peacekeeping forces decline to engage for fear of violence and recent killings of peacekeepers."

But Nuebel Kovarik declines to hold off publishing the official announcement to accommodate the change, saying it's "minor" enough to be done later on as a revision.

"We don't say the country is perfect," she concluded.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Hundreds of children separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border remain separated from them, including 497 in government custody, according to a new court filing Thursday.

The figure includes 22 children under the age of 5 still in government care. Six of those are 4 years old or younger whose parents were deported without them.

A total of 1,937 children have been reunified with parents, up only 14 from last week.

The court filing from the Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union case describes a slow and laborious process to try to connect the families that have been separated.

It remains unclear exactly how many parents were deported without their children, though it's in the hundreds. By the government's latest count, there are 322 deported parents who have children still in custody.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump alleged Tuesday — without providing any evidence — that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation will meddle in the midterm elections to benefit Democrats.

Trump's claim is his latest attack on the credibility of the Russia investigation as being politically motivated, though it's a significant new step in his attacks on what is intended to be an independent probe working to get to the bottom of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election.

"The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls," Trump tweeted. "There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!"

The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018

Trump's use of the word "rigged" invokes a line he frequently employed in 2016 -- often when he was trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls -- to raise doubts about the election outcome. At the time, he appeared to be suggesting that the election would be out of the hands of voters.

Although CNN has reported that several members of Mueller's team have donated to Democrats, Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has also been the subject of several Republican-led congressional inquiries. Mueller is a Republican who was appointed as FBI director by President George W. Bush, and the man who appointed him as special counsel, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, was appointed by Trump and is also a registered Republican.

__label__world (CNN) Supporters of Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, have donated large sums to a crowdfunding campaign to pay for his legal defense after sexual misconduct allegations were made against him.

Salmond announced Wednesday on Twitter that he was resigning from the Scottish National Party (SNP), which he once led, while he fights to clear his name.

He has strenuously denied two claims of sexual harassment, and is taking the country's government to court over its handling of the accusations against him.

Salmond set up a crowdfunding page online with a target of £50,000 ($65,000) to meet his legal fees in the case. Supporters had pledged more than £67,000 ($87,000) by 9:30 a.m. on Thursday.

However, Salmond faced criticism from some quarters for asking ordinary people to contribute from their own pockets.

Scottish Labour lawmaker Rhoda Grant tweeted: "That an independently wealthy man with his celebrity and political power is raising legal fees through crowdfunding for a case ultimately linked to sexual harassment is unbelievable."

Scottish Conservative lawmaker Annie Wells said Salmond had "some brass neck" to publicly crowdfund for his legal fees.

"There is something deeply unsettling about an independently wealthy man asking ordinary people for money so he can take the government of Scotland to court for investigating allegations of sexual assault against staff," she said, in a statement tweeted by her party.

The controversy has split the ruling SNP between Salmond loyalists and those who back the government's handling of the allegations, which emerged weeks after the government introduced new procedures for filing sexual harassment complaints.

Salmond said his resignation was an effort to remove a potential line of attack against the SNP, and said he planned to reapply for membership after he cleared his name.

The Scottish First Minister, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, said in a statement posted to Twitter on Wednesday that she felt "huge sadness" about the situation that had engulfed her friend and mentor of almost 30 years.

However, she said while the party hadn't received any complaints, the fact remained that two allegations had been made against Salmond to the government that "could not be ignored or swept under the carpet."

"Complaints must be investigated without fear or favour, regardless of the seniority of the person involved," she added.

The complaints relate to Salmond's alleged behavior at the first minister's official Bute House residence, according to the Daily Record, but Salmond says that even he hasn't been informed of the details.

Last week he announced he was taking the government to court , claiming it had denied him the opportunity to defend himself against the claims, by failing to share the evidence against him.

Salmond pointed out that the Scottish government had confirmed that it hadn't received any complaints before January, more than three years after he left office as first minister, and after a political career spanning decades.

"That is the record of 30 years of public service. So, let me be clear again. I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality," he said.

He said he believes opposition parties had been pressuring Sturgeon to suspend him from the SNP, as part of efforts to undermine party unity.

"I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP," he said. "Most of all I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division."

Salmond resigned as first minister and SNP leader after a defeat in the November 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, which he had championed.

Sturgeon, who replaced him, has maintained the party's dominance in Scotland but not to the degree seen before the referendum. One of the highest-profile casualties of a swing away from the SNP was Salmond himself, who lost his parliamentary seat in the 2017 election.
__label__world (CNN) Immigration hardliner Peter Dutton is pushing to be Australia's 30th Prime Minister, the country's sixth in just over 10 years, as a conservative leadership coup against current leader Malcolm Turnbull gains momentum.

A rift in the ruling Liberal Party over Turnbull's climate change policy, known as the National Energy Guarantee (NEG), led to a challenge for the party's leadership on Monday morning.

Dutton, 47, a leader in the party's conservative faction, only narrowly lost a leadership contest against Turnbull and is now seeking to mount another attempt, following the resignation of three high-profile Australian ministers, including Finance Minister Mathias Cormann.

A few minutes ago I spoke with Malcolm Turnbull to advise him I believed the majority of the party room no longer supported his leadership. Accordingly, I asked him to convene a party room meeting at which I would challenge for the leadership of the Parliamentary Liberal Party.

A veteran politician and former Queensland policeman who joined the Australian Parliament aged just 31, Dutton has made a name for himself in recent years as the country's immigration minister, overseeing Australia's strict border protection regime.

But the staunch conservative has also proved to be something of a controversial figure in Australian politics, following disparaging comments about immigrants.

A poll in early August found just 7% of voters from his own ruling Liberal Party wanted Dutton to be their leader, behind Prime Minister Turnbull on 51%.

However, as of Monday, almost a dozen ministers had offered their resignations to Turnbull, and with just eight votes standing between him and the most powerful job in Australia, Dutton's bid to become prime minister could soon become a reality.

Speaking to CNN, former Liberal Party leader John Hewson issued a note of caution, saying Dutton wasn't a "natural leader" and his likely policy agenda might be too extreme for average Australians.

There are even questions over whether or not Dutton is eligible to sit in Parliament, over local media reports his family's childcare businesses may be receiving money from the government in breach of constitutional rules.

"If Peter Dutton is the answer, what the hell's the question?" Hewson said.

Australia's then-Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton (2nd R) speaks at Parliament as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (bottom L) looks at his notes in Canberra on August 20.

Ideological rift

The ruling Liberal Party is primarily split between two ideological factions -- a moderate, pro-business grouping led by Turnbull and a large conservative faction, partially led by Dutton.

The differences between the two groups have widened in recent years, especially over immigration and climate change policy.

"(The conservatives) have a very strong ideological position and have never been convinced Malcolm Turnbull ought to be Liberal PM. They don't accept his credentials," John Warhurst, emeritus professor of Australian Politics at the Australian National University, told CNN.

The deep divisions between the two groups exploded when Turnbull tried to legislate action on climate change in line with the Paris Agreement, which many in the conservative faction want to dump altogether.

The party's right wing is now looking to install a leader from within their own faction, with Dutton emerging as the clear front runner.

A leading light of Australia's conservative movement, Dutton repeatedly opposed same-sex marriage prior to its legalization in Australia in 2017, and was one of the architects of a divisive national vote designed to stall the issue.

He was also one of a small number of politicians who boycotted then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's apology in 2008 to the Stolen Generations, a name given to the tens of thousands of Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their parents and families by the government between 1910 and 1970.

If the former immigration minister takes power in coming weeks, Australia's government is likely to move further to the right on migration, climate change and social issues ahead of a national election, due to be held by May 2019 at the latest.

But Hewson said he didn't believe that a "hard line right" policy platform, similar to that of US President Donald Trump, could be successful in Australia. "If you give up the center ground, you'll make it truly hard to win an election," he said.

Changes to immigration?

Australia has long considered itself a successful multicultural, immigrant nation, with almost one in four of the country's population in 2017 originally born overseas.

But as the country's immigration minister since 2014, Dutton has been a longtime advocate for lower immigration and harsher tests on potential migrants to Australia.

Speaking to Sky News following his narrow loss in Monday's leadership ballot, Dutton reiterated his previous statements that immigration numbers needed to be cut.

"It's clear the Australian public particularly in capital cities ... have a view that the migration number is too high, people sitting in congested traffic each day when they go to work or go and pick the kids up," he said

In 2016, he complained to Sky News about immigrants who "won't be numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English," adding they would be taking Australian jobs.

At the same time as he has voiced concern over immigration numbers, Dutton sparked controversy by suggesting a special visa category could be created to allow white South African farmers, allegedly persecuted in their home country, to come to Australia as refugees.

"I do think on the information I've seen people do need help and they need help from a civilized country," Dutton told Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph on March 14.

Speaking to CNN at the time, South African farmers groups denied there was a need for a special refugee visa at this stage.

Climate change action unlikely

In early 2015 Dutton was picked up on an overhead microphone speaking to then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott about a recent trip to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.

Abbott said he was sorry he was late, he was still running on "Cape York time" to which Dutton responded, "Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your doors," he said, joking about the effects of climate change.

Dutton apologized for the joke but the conservative politician is likely to take a dim view of any action on climate change.

The Liberal Party's conservative faction is very hostile towards the Paris Agreement, with many calling for it to be ditched, and instead advocating for greater coal power in Australia.

Following his loss to Turnbull on Friday, Dutton said he wanted to lower energy prices for Australian families, and called for a national inquiry into how expensive electricity bills had become.

"Australian consumers for way too long have been paying way too much for fuel and for electricity," he told local radio station Triple M.

Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor at Griffith University's School of Science, told CNN that action on climate change under a potential Dutton government was highly unlikely, given the objections to Turnbull's "inadequate" policy.

"It's clear the faction won't take any serious action to slow down climate change, they will argue the government's duty is to have a secure energy supply at as low cost as possible, and they will say that means keeping old, dirty coal fired power stations open as long as possible," he said.
__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is suspected of bribery in Case 4000, one of the ongoing investigations facing the Israeli leader, a police investigator said at a court hearing Thursday morning.

One of the biggest cases facing Israel's Prime Minister, Case 4000 deals with the relationship between the Ministry of Communications -- at a time when Netanyahu held the position of communications minister alongside the premiership -- and Israeli telecommunications firm Bezeq.

Sara and Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations in September 2017.

Prosecutors say Benjamin Netanyahu advanced regulatory benefits worth up to 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to Shaul Elovitch, Netanyahu's friend and Bezeq's controlling shareholder. In exchange, prosecutors say Elovitch gave Netanyahu favorable news coverage on an online news site he owned called Walla! News.

Thursday's hearing, held in the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court, was about Elovitch's assets, which have been frozen by police. Elovitch, who proclaims his innocence, is suspected of fraud, bribery, money laundering, corporate breach of trust, and more.

Questioned by Elovitch's lawyers, police investigator Uri Kanar said, "(Sara Netanyahu) is a suspect in the case. She was interrogated under caution for bribery."

__label__politics (CNN) Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has demonstrated a deep suspicion of government regulation, a pattern aligned with the Trump administration and perhaps best exemplified by his dissent in the case of a killer whale that attacked a SeaWorld trainer.

The case, arising from a widely publicized tragedy in Orlando, Florida, offers a window on the legal approach and sometimes cheeky writing style of the man poised to join the nation's highest court.

As Kavanaugh blasted a Labor Department move to sanction SeaWorld following the drowning of a trainer by the orca Tilikum, he declared that the agency had "stormed headlong into a new regulatory arena" and warned that regulators would try to impose new safety requirements on sports, the circus and more.

Overall, his view is that agencies should exercise authority as clearly spelled out in federal statutes and that judges should not, as occurred in the SeaWorld case, defer to agency interpretations that go beyond what's explicit in a law.

That view goes to the heart of a modern debate in the courts and Congress over regulators' power. It's a debate that generally splits liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans. And it's one that can have real world consequences for federal safeguards covering workers, consumers and the environment.

Kavanaugh, as well as some of the Supreme Court's more conservative justices, question a longstanding legal principle dictating that judges defer to agencies' interpretations of vague and open-ended statutes, as long as the interpretations are reasonable. They counter that if there's new problem to solve, Congress should address it with a new law.

That would inevitably lead to less regulation, observes Harvard law professor Jody Freeman, who specializes in administrative law and environmental issues. "If you hamstring the agencies and say every time there's a new issue, every time there's a new problem ... you have to go back and get express permission from Congress, that's a way of saying, you don't want the agencies to do very much. Congress doesn't produce much new law now."

In the SeaWorld case, decided in 2014 by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh set up the issue as a question of "Who decides?"

"When should we as a society paternalistically decide that the participants in these sports and entertainment activities must be protected from themselves ... " he wrote in a dissenting opinion. "And most importantly for this case, who decides that the risk to participants is too high?"

His answer was not federal regulators. He argued that the Labor Department acted arbitrarily when it penalized SeaWorld for failing to keep a trainer from "recognized hazards" under federal job-safety law, when the work was inherently risky. He compared the SeaWorld trainer's work to sports and entertainment, such as: "The circus. Horse racing. Tiger taming. Standing in the batter's box against a 95 mile per house fastball. Bull riding at the rodeo. .... Movie stunts. The list goes on."

The majority on the three-judge DC Circuit panel said such comparisons were inapt.

"The nature of SeaWorld's workplace and the unusual nature of the hazard to its employees performing in close physical contact with killer whales do not remove SeaWorld from its obligation ... to protect its employees from recognized hazards," the court said in a majority opinion by Judge Judith Rogers, signed also by Judge Merrick Garland. They offered comparisons to traditional but dangerous industries such as welding and firefighting.

Those judges deferred to the Labor secretary's interpretation of workplace safety coverage.

Such deference, a longtime pattern in federal courts, is the opposite of the skepticism Kavanaugh advocates.

In opinions and speeches, Kavanaugh has questioned a 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council , that said judges should defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. That, he said in a 2017 speech, "encourages agency aggressiveness on a large scale."

"Under the guise of ambiguity," Kavanaugh insisted, "agencies can stretch the meaning of statutes enacted by Congress to accommodate their preferred policy outcomes."

Overall, Kavanaugh's view appears stricter than centrist conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh would succeed. Kavanaugh has more firmly and clearly laid out arguments for greater skepticism of regulation that encroaches on business.

SeaWorld cited after trainer's death

Dawn Brancheau, a SeaWorld trainer, was performing in a pool at Shamu Stadium before a live audience in 2010. Tilikum, who had earlier killed a trainer at a marine park in Vancouver, had apparently been coached at SeaWorld to mimic Brancheau's behavior. But in this incident, instead of rolling over on a platform, Tilikum grabbed Brancheau and pulled her into the pool. Brancheau drowned. (The incident became the subject of a 2013 documentary, "Blackfish," co-produced by CNN.)

JUST WATCHED Killer whale at center of 'Blackfish' dies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Killer whale at center of 'Blackfish' dies 01:12

After an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Labor Department cited and fined SeaWorld for violating a duty to protect its animal trainers from "recognized hazards" of drowning or injury when working with killer whales. It said the theme park could have better protected trainers such as Brancheau with, for example, physical barriers.

SeaWorld, defending the precautions that had been taken, argued that it had not exposed its employees to hazards and, more fundamentally, asserted that when a risk is inherent in the activity that risk cannot constitute grounds for a recognized hazard under OSHA rules.

Kavanaugh agreed as he first paid homage to risk-taking performers. "Americans like to witness the thrill of victory, to cheer the linebacker who hammers the running back at the goal line, to yell with admiration as Derek Jeter flies into the stands down the left-field line to make a catch ..."

The DC Circuit majority wrote that "had Congress intended all unsafe and unhealthy performances in the entertainment industry to be beyond the scope of employee protection, it could have included such an exemption in the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and it did not."

Kavanaugh said their interpretation went too far.

"In the real world," Kavanaugh wrote, "it is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld."

Such sentiment worries Senate Democrats, including Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein. She has said she will scrutinize Kavanaugh's record in this area because he would be "the deciding vote in cases about whether federal agencies have the authority to curb climate change, protect consumers, safeguard workers' rights."

For its part, the Trump administration wants judges who would diminish the influence of federal agencies on American life and business.

White House counsel Don McGahn, who has taken the lead in assisting Trump in screening candidates for the bench, told the Conservative Political Action Conference in February that President Trump was seeking jurists who had a record of scrutinizing "the regulatory apparatus."

"One of the things we interview on is their views on administrative law," McGahn said, adding, "This is different than judicial selection in past years."
__label__politics (CNN) There is something in the current "Notorious RBG" fervor that offers the perfect paradox for a woman whose early career was marked by rejection and work in the trenches of anti-discrimination law.

She made the law review at both Harvard and Columbia law schools and graduated at the top of her class at Columbia. Yet she was rejected for the most prestigious judicial clerkships and spurned by law firms. It was not just that she was a woman. She was also a mother caring for a young daughter.

But that was nearly six decades ago, and on Friday, Ginsburg marks the 25th anniversary of her judicial oath on the US Supreme Court.

When she failed to land a law firm job, she turned to teaching, then became a women's rights lawyer and eventually won a federal appeals court seat. As a Supreme Court justice since 1993, she has authored scores of opinions that have helped set the course of the law, particularly on equality rights. She wrote the landmark ruling that forced the state-run Virginia Military Institute to admit women.

Now it is her scorching dissents that draw most public attention.

Popular culture has embraced the RBG phenomenon , perhaps because the woman who crusaded against sex discrimination is now a vocal dissenter on a high court that is becoming increasingly conservative.

She is also an original member of what is today's #MeToo movement, recounting her own experiences as a pathbreaking woman on campus and in the workforce.

The "Notorious RBG" meme, a play on the late rapper Notorious B.I.G., was created as a response to a 2013 dissent Ginsburg wrote when the court majority issued a milestone decision rolling back voting-rights protections. Ginsburg's dissents continue to energize Democrats, at a time when Republicans control the executive and legislative branches of government and the Supreme Court moves rightward.

From films to action figures, the entertainment world has shown a fascination with the trailblazer who changed the course of women's rights and at age 85 still pumps iron.

The documentary "RBG," co-produced by CNN, has made $13.5 million at the box office, according to comScore, and will be broadcast next month on the network. Oscar nominee Felicity Jones will play her in a feature film, "On the Basis of Sex," in December.

The justice said recently that she hopes to stay on the Supreme Court at least five more years , when she'll be 90. She has survived two bouts with cancer, colorectal in 1999 and pancreatic in 2009.

Ginsburg's celebrity might not have been predicted when President Bill Clinton chose her for the high court in summer 1993.

Then a 60-year-old federal appellate judge, she was not Clinton's first choice. He was looking for a flashier appointee and initially tried to woo former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to the bench.

Ginsburg, with her large-rimmed glasses, hair tied back in a short ponytail, presented the picture of seriousness. She spoke of taking "measured motions" as a jurist. Supporters portrayed her as a night owl who spent hours hunched over law books and legal briefs, tepid coffee and prunes at hand. Her daughter created a little book titled "Mommy Laughed," chronicling the few times it happened.

Once on the Supreme Court, Ginsburg was a sharp questioner and meticulous opinion-writer. She leaned in but without the attention-getting style of the first female justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, or gregarious longtime pal Antonin Scalia

She was hardly a liberal in the mode of contemporary justices on the left: William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall or Harry Blackmun. But as the court changed over the years and became more conservative with each retirement, she found herself carrying the banner for the left.

It is the lesson of Ginsburg's eight decades -- marked by early loss and professional rejection -- that life's vicissitudes can open unexpected doors and bring new opportunities.

Now carrying a commercial tote bag with the words "I dissent," she appreciates her icon status. But she still conveys a modest approach. When asked recently during a public appearance how she wanted to be remembered, she said, "As someone who did the best she could."

Early life marked by death

Ruth Bader was born in Brooklyn in 1933, the second daughter of Celia and Nathan Bader. Her older sister, who gave Ruth the nickname of "Kiki," died of meningitis before Ruth was 2 years old. (The justice's real name was Joan Ruth Bader, but she said that because so many girls in her kindergarten class were named Joan, her mother asked that she be called Ruth.)

Her mother encouraged her to excel in school. But she would not live to see her daughter's early achievements. Just before Ruth was to graduate from high school with honors, her mother died of cervical cancer. Ruth missed graduation, staying home with her grieving father, and her teachers delivered her various awards to her after the ceremony.

She attended Cornell University on scholarship as a government major. There she met Martin Ginsburg, whom she would later describe as the first boy who "cared that I had a brain."

They married in 1954 and the following year had their first child, Jane. A second child, James, was born 10 years later.

Ruth and Martin attended Harvard Law School. Ruth began when Jane was a baby, and soon was caring also for Martin, who had been diagnosed with testicular cancer.

She typed up his class notes and helped with his studies, learning to exist on very little sleep, as she kept up with her own studies and attended to daughter Jane. Martin recovered, graduated and landed a job in New York City in 1958.

By that point, Ruth had finished two of the three years of law school. When they moved to New York, she completed her law degree at Columbia University. She graduated in 1959, tied for first place in her class.

She was rebuffed for a Supreme Court clerkship by Justice Felix Frankfurter because she was a woman and then was turned down by major New York law firms. She later wrote that law firms in the 1950s were beginning to hire Jews. "They had just gotten over that form of discrimination," she wrote. "But to be a Jew, a woman and a mother to boot," she wrote, "that combination was a bit much."

She became a law clerk to a federal district court judge, then worked at Columbia as a researcher. Her early specialty was civil procedure, and she spent several months in Sweden in the early 1960s studying its legal procedures.

The women's rights movement beckons

While Ginsburg was teaching at Rutgers Law School, from 1963 to 1972, her interest in sexual equality was sparked by the broader women's rights movement underway. In the early 1970s, she has said in interviews, she realized how few court rulings, commentary and teaching materials covered sex discrimination. In 1972, she returned to Columbia University law school as a professor, the first woman to be named to a tenured position. That year, she also helped found the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project.

She argued six cases before the Supreme Court, winning five. Her strategy was distinctive. Rather than use only women as plaintiffs to challenge discriminatory government practices, she often chose men.

In an important 1975 case, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , the Supreme Court struck down a Social Security law that provided survivors' benefits for widows with small children but not for widowers with small children.

"The whole ACLU Women's Rights Project -- it would not have been possible 10 years earlier," Ginsburg said in a 2016 interview.

She said she felt that she was also in the right place in late 1979, when a spot suddenly opened on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Judge Harold Leventhal, then 64, died after suffering a heart attack. "Who could have predicted that?" Ginsburg said. "He was playing tennis."

President Jimmy Carter nominated Ginsburg to the DC Circuit, and she was approved by the Senate in 1980. Ginsburg said later that she had been hoping for a seat on the New York-based 2nd Circuit, where she and Martin were living. But it was fortuitous that she ended up on the DC Circuit, which has become a steppingstone to the high court.

She and Martin, a prominent tax lawyer, moved to Washington, where he began teaching at Georgetown University law school. ( Martin died in 2010 of cancer.)

On the influential appeals court that specializes in federal regulatory disputes, Ginsburg was an exacting jurist and moderate liberal. She became close friends with Scalia, whom President Ronald Reagan appointed to the DC Circuit in 1982 and then to the Supreme Court in 1986. Ideological opposites but both former law professors, they enjoyed editing each other's opinions. Opera lovers and avid travelers, they socialized regularly and, with their spouses, began a tradition of spending New Year's Eve together.

When Justice Byron White announced his retirement in 1993, Clinton considered several possible candidates, including Cuomo, who decided against what seemed to be the cloistered life of the court. Top aides thought Clinton was then ready to select Judge Stephen Breyer (whom Clinton chose the next year when another vacancy occurred).

Attorney General Janet Reno had been pushing Clinton to meet with Ginsburg. Nearly three months after White had made his retirement known, the President interviewed Ginsburg on June 13.

The next day he formally nominated her in a Rose Garden ceremony. Ginsburg's life story and background in women's rights appealed to Clinton, who when announcing the selection emphasized that law firms had rejected Ginsburg because she was a woman raising a child.

He said she represented to women's legal rights what Thurgood Marshall "was to the movement for the rights of African-Americans."

When she accepted the nomination, Ginsburg said of her late mother, "I pray that I may be all that she would have been had she lived in an age when women could aspire and achieve, and daughters are cherished as much as sons."

Ginsburg was approved by the Senate 96-3 on August 3 and took the judicial oath on August 10, becoming the first justice appointed by a Democratic president in 26 years; the last had been Marshall, named by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967.

A high court evolution

On the Supreme Court, Ginsburg has been best known for her opinions related to civil rights. In her first term, as she joined an opinion (written by O'Connor) that enhanced workers' ability to prove job discrimination based on sexual harassment, Ginsburg added a concurring statement that underscored the unequal treatment of women in the workplace.

"The critical issue," she wrote in in Harris v. Forklift Systems, "is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed."

In 1996, she wrote the court's opinion forcing the state-run Virginia Military Institute to admit women. She said the state's military school "serves the state's sons" yet "makes no provision whatever for her daughters. That is not equal protection" as required by the Constitution. The vote was 7-1; only Scalia dissented. Justice Clarence Thomas, whose son attended VMI, did not participate.

In 2017, VMI honored Ginsburg. During a speech to the school's cadets , she observed that opposition to the Supreme Court ruling had faded when the school saw "how much good women could do for the institution."

The VMI decision may have been a high-water mark for her on behalf of a court majority. Many of Ginsburg's civil rights opinions have been, by and large, written as a dissenter.

Since 2010 and the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Ginsburg has been the most senior liberal justice and a robust voice for the left. Her 2013 dissent in a case invalidating a major portion of the Voting Rights Act, Shelby County v. Holder, inspired the Notorious RBG meme, the viral social media brainchild of Shana Knizhnik, then a New York University law student. Mugs and all manner of other retail tchotchkes followed.

She continues to speak boldly through her dissents, but also during interviews. In July 2016, she complained to reporters for The Associated Press and The New York Times about then-candidate Donald Trump, saying she could not take him seriously, and kidded that if he won she might move to New Zealand. Critics said such remarks could undermine her appearance of judicial impartiality.

When asked her if she regretted her sentiment, she only ramped it up. "He is a faker," she told CNN . "He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that."

Trump jumped into the fray, saying "her mind is shot" and that she should resign. Ginsburg ended up putting out a statement, regretting her "ill-advised" remark and vowing to "be more circumspect."

The day after the November 2016 election, she wore over her black robe the collar (black with silver crystals) she reserves for days in which she issues a dissenting opinion.

Experiences that continue to resonate

While she has since avoided addressing the Trump presidency beyond her judicial opinions, she has continued to speak on the issues of the day. Earlier this year, at the Sundance Film Festival, she praised the #MeToo movement. "I think it's about time," she said. "For so long, women were silent."

She recounted an episode from her days at Cornell, as she prepared for a chemistry test. "My instructor said ... 'I'll give you a practice exam,'" Ginsburg said. The next day she discovered that the practice exam was, in fact, the real test.

"And I knew exactly what he wanted in return," she said. "I went to (the instructor's) office and said, 'How dare you? How dare you?' And that was the end of it."

In an earlier interview, she told me that as a law professor she had trouble getting male colleagues to listen to her. "I don't know how many meetings I attended in the '60s and the '70s, where I would say something, and I thought it was a pretty good idea. ... Then somebody else would say exactly what I said. Then people would become alert to it, respond to it."

That still occurred when she became a justice, she told me in a 2009 interview. "It can happen even in the conferences in the court. When I will say something ... and it isn't until somebody else says it that everyone will focus on the point."

Her direct, even defiant, approach has boosted her profile, even as she says she hopes for less division on the Supreme Court.

She remains an optimist. "I have been lucky at every turn," she says, adding that it may have been for the better that she never landed the law firm positions she sought.

"I would have been long retired from a law firm," rather than in a life-tenured position on the nation's highest court. "Things that look bad at the time can turn out to be the greatest thing."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum acknowledged Sunday that his "Medicare for all" plan would require increasing taxes on corporations in his home state.

Gillum said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he would "absolutely not raise taxes on everyday working Floridians" to institute the proposal. Pressed on whether wealthier Floridians would see a tax hike, he said corporations would front the plan.

"We will increase taxes for corporations in our state who, right now, just so you are aware, only 3% of companies in the state of Florida pay the corporate tax rate. ... And that 3% under the Donald Trump tax scam got a windfall of $6.3 billion overnight due to the tax reform that took place in Washington, DC," Gillum said.

"We're not asking for all of it," he continued. "We simply said we believe that we ought to bring a billion of that money back into the state's government because being a cheap-date state has not worked for the state of Florida."

A spokesman for Gillum said the mayor was citing an analysis by the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy in 2015 that said only about 53,000 corporations in Florida, or about 3 percent of the total, paid any state corporate income tax.

__label__world Story highlights ARSA was accused of the massacre by Myanmar's government in September

Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar

(CNN) Members of a Rohingya militant group allegedly massacred dozens of men, women and children, execution-style in Hindu villages in Myanmar's Rakhine State last year, according to a new Amnesty International report.

In mid-2017, ARSA fighters engaged in "scores of clashes with security forces," according to Amnesty. At the same time, ARSA committed "serious human rights abuses...including unlawful killings and abductions," the human rights group said.

"It's hard to ignore the sheer brutality of ARSA's actions, which have left an indelible impression on the survivors we've spoken to," said Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at Amnesty International.

On August 25, 2017, ARSA militants attacked a Hindu village in northern Maungdaw Township, and rounded up some 69 men, women and children, the majority of whom were killed, "execution-style," according to survivors who spoke to Amnesty.

He's also the co-host of the "Politics & Polls" podcast. Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) This past week President Donald Trump went after some of his favorite targets. Within the span of a few days, he lashed out at migrants in Central America who are seeking legal asylum in the US, dismissed his predecessor as "Cheatin' Obama," brought back his false claims about voters committing massive fraud in the 2016 election and went after a few of his most-hated news organizations, including CNN and the Washington Post. "The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact," the president tweeted Sunday morning.

None of this is new. The rhetorical barrage of anger is a prime example of the president's favorite political tactic -- he classic wartime strategy of vilifying, criminalizing and dehumanizing the "enemy."

In times of war, it has been common for presidents to drum up public support for a military operation by rallying the nation against an evil that lurked overseas. Sometimes it hasn't taken much effort by a president to make this case, such as with Adolf Hitler in the early 1940s. Other times, such as with Saddam Hussein in 2002 and 2003, the commander in chief faces a much bigger challenge in trying to prove that an enemy represents a direct threat that requires military action.

This tactic has been central to the President's method of political combat at home. Often using catchy monikers to make his case, President Trump goes all in when he rips apart a target, with the goal of making certain the public can never look at that person or institution the same way again. By the time he is done with them, Trump's hope is that the public won't trust an individual or organization, won't believe anything that they say and will fear them as threats to the republic.

Since showing that he could do this to his Republican primary competitors and then Hillary Clinton, Trump has stuck to this playbook. His vitriol has been intense and he has been willing to go to extreme lengths -- stretching the truth or making things up -- to generate fear and anger.

__label__politics Since the beginning of the 115th Congress, more than 40 Republicans have left or announced they plan to leave the House by the end of the year. A handful of members have resigned amid scandal . Another group is leaving to run for higher office -- for seats in the Senate or to become governors of their home states.

Still, the majority of Republicans leaving Congress this cycle are leaving politics altogether -- a side effect, they say, of the political climate and President Donald Trump, a commander in chief who hails from their own party.

CNN sat down with three outgoing Republicans -- all of whom left for different reasons -- about why they are calling it quits.

Ryan Costello: The reluctant retirement

Ryan Costello, 41, is still new to Congress.

Elected in 2014, the lanky, laid-back congressman is a rare brand in the House GOP conference: a young moderate willing to break with his leadership and his President on everything from gun control bills to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Representing the Philadelphia suburbs, Costello has remained left of many of his colleagues. However, in the Trump era, the congressman is reluctantly moving on, fed up with the polarization of not only Washington but also the country at large.

"I feel, increasingly, that if you're a member of Congress, they assume that you're not good," he told CNN in a recent interview. "They assume that you're not telling the truth. No matter what you do, someone's out there locked and loaded to say something disparaging, false, mean, in an attempt to have other people not like you."

But Costello -- unlike some of his older colleagues, who've decided to hang it up after decades-long careers or after being term-limited out of powerful committee chairmanships -- said t he Pennsylvania state Supreme Court's redrawing of his district so that it became more Democratic-leaning also was a major factor.

"I'm 41. I have an 8-month old. I have a 4-year old. I just lost half my congressional district. The state Supreme Court decided that they were going to try and take me out," Costello said.

Another factor? The reality that no matter what day it is in the Capitol, he typically is inundated with questions about Trump.

"No matter what I say or do, I feel all I do is answer questions about Donald Trump rather than health insurance or tax policy," Costello said. "I think it's a very challenging political environment, and when you add on top of that just the demands from a work-family balance, I just felt it was best for me to take stock in my life and have eight months to decide what I'm going to do next rather than, potentially, six weeks."

When he walks away, Costello said, he'll miss the camaraderie he felt with other members at times and the "pinch-me" moments, the experiences he couldn't have had if he weren't a member of the US House of Representatives.

"There is the occasional pinch-me moment. There's the occasional bang-my-head-against-the-wall moment, too, but there's the occasional pinch-me moment," he said. "That is something that I'll certainly miss."

Jeff Flake: Trump's foil stepping aside

JUST WATCHED Flake: the choice was embrace Trump, or retire Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Flake: the choice was embrace Trump, or retire 00:51

There are few Republicans in Washington who have been more uncompromisingly outspoken about Trump and shortcomings than Arizona's Sen. Jeff Flake.

From the earliest days of the presidential campaign, in which Trump suggested Mexican immigrants were rapists and Flake's Arizona GOP colleague, Sen. John McCain, didn't deserve the distinction of war hero because he'd been captured in Vietnam, Flake has been crystal clear that he thinks Trump's bombastic style is hurting the country and endangering America's reputation abroad.

It's Trump and what he represents about the far-right and nativist underpinnings of Flake's beloved Republican Party right now that drove the 55-year-old senator to decide that now was as good a time as any to retire from Congress.

"Our debt has increased massively; we're no longer the party of free trade. We've become a party of anger and resentment, and that is not the optimistic vision that I cut my teeth on as a Republican listening to Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush or others," Flake said.

After a single term in the Senate and more than a decade in the House of Representatives, Flake will leave at the end of the year just after his youngest son has graduated from high school and he and his wife, Cheryl Flake, are empty-nesters.

"My wife reminded me the other day that we had done this completely backward. I thought if I ever run for office, when I was younger, much younger, that it would be after the kids were grown," Flake said. "Instead we raised our kids during this period and now they're leaving the nest and I'm retiring."

Flake said the first thing he plans to do is take a big trip (maybe a couple), similar to the exit strategy of former President Barack Obama.

"I will go (to) an island or two. I've done that in the past, even when I've been in session, just to find a break and as a hobby," he said. "Go out and survived on an island with no food or water. That's my kind of idea of fun."

As he heads for the exit, he leaves some unfinished business. Flake -- who has been among the Republicans who worked relentlessly on immigration restructuring and enshrining the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program into law -- said he's frustrated he hasn't been able to see the legislation through. He also lamented that he's leaving at a time when the Senate isn't doing as much legislatively as he wishes it was, in part because of arcane Senate rules and in part because, he said, leadership on both sides of the aisle has shielded members from difficult votes.

"We end up in this dance where we just don't vote very much. That needs to change. Take a vote. Just take a vote," he said. "I hear sometimes from my colleagues, 'We can't do that because the President doesn't support it.' Ultimately the President has to sign or reject what we pass, but to obsess over whether the President will agree with what we've put on his desk just means that we put very little on his desk."

Behind the scenes, Flake said, there are many more Republicans as concerned about the President and the direction of the party as he is. From public policy to the Russia investigation, Flake said, members in the GOP are more vocal behind the scenes than they are before the cameras.

There is one issue where members are especially worried: No one wants Trump to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.

"All of us are quietly, and sometimes publicly, warning, or begging, or admonishing the President not to go that route. I certainly hope he doesn't," Flake said.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: The first Latina in Congress retires

JUST WATCHED 'I'm not a Trumpian. I'm a Republican' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'I'm not a Trumpian. I'm a Republican' 01:47

In the span of a single hour, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's office was never not doing something.

The Floridian sat down with CNN, met with a landscape architect and entertained representatives from an after-school program for underprivileged kids, asking questions and engaging in a manner that many members who've been around Capitol Hill for as long as she has lost long ago. Everyone was offered Cuban coffee, perhaps the secret to Ros-Lehtinen's boundless energy and enthusiasm for a job she's held for nearly three decades.

Unlike other members walking away this cycle, Ros-Lehtinen doesn't have a list of gripes about her job, the hours, the fundraising, the endless mix of meetings. She loved it all, she said.

Instead -- as the first Latina ever elected to Congress (a fact she herself didn't know until after she'd won her seat) -- Ros-Lehtinen offers a glimpse into just how much Congress has changed for women and minorities in a body where they are steadily gaining ground.

"When I first got to Washington, there were not even 30 women. Not even 30 women in the House. I don't know what the number is now. I've lost count, there's so many of us, thank goodness. Is it parity? Is it what it should be? No. But is it getting better? You bet," she said.

Still, Ros-Lehtinen argues there is more work to do on some committees, like House Foreign Affairs, where she served her entire congressional career and once chaired.

"We need to do better in getting more women involved in those kinds of committees, so that when the audience is looking at us, they're thinking, 'Oh, yeah. This is representative,' " she said.

When she retires, Ros-Lehtinen said, she hopes to split her time between Washington and Florida. While Miami is her primary residence, she said she has a "dumpy" townhouse in DC in a great location and wants to "save it for a rainy day." She's not interested in shunning politics altogether. Even in the era of Trump, who she admits has made Washington more polarized, she believes Congress has always been a tough place.

"It seems a little more antagonistic, so that part has changed a little bit, but it's not like this was 'Leave it to Beaver,' 'Mayberry R.F.D.,' 'The Donna Reed Show,' " Ros-Lehtinen said. "It was never a Pollyanna, Mary Poppins place. It was always rough and tumble politics."

The congresswoman leaves her post with very few regrets, although she admits she would have liked to have helped establish an American Latino Museum as well as passed her bill that would allow Holocaust survivors to present a case in court, something they aren't able to do. She also once aspired to have a perfect voting record, but that was shattered on her first day in Congress in 1989, when she got an unexpected invitation to meet with the father of her congressional campaign manager, George H.W. Bush and Jeb Bush, respectively.

"George Herbert Walker Bush was the President and he had campaigned for me in Miami, so the first day, I get sworn in and his office calls me up, the White House, and ... says, 'The President would like to see you,' " she recalled. "I said, 'Well, we have votes.' So the very first day, I missed like seven votes, so so much for my perfect voting record, which is something I wanted to do."

On a desert plateau 36 miles from the tiny South Australian town of Marree lies one of the country's greatest unsolved modern mysteries.

Lines run through the barren earth, carved one foot deep and over 115 feet wide. Stretching over 2.6 miles, the lines join together to form an image of an Aboriginal figure wielding a stick or boomerang.

This is the Marree Man, one of the world's largest geoglyphs. In the 20 years since it first appeared in 1998, nobody has stepped forward to claim responsibility, giving rise to countless theories and investigations.

Now, an Australian entrepreneur is offering $3,712 ($5,000 AUD) for information regarding its creation.

Dick Smith, founder of Dick Smith Electronics and Dick Smith Foods, decided to tackle the mystery in 2016.

In the last two years, he and his team have pored over images and videos, investigated the various theories, and reviewed the few pieces of evidence available -- to no avail.

He believes a group was responsible, and is now hoping that a sizable cash award will help bring forward new information.

"I can't see how it was done by one person, you'd have to have three or four to do it, and it would take weeks to put in. In that case, how has it been kept secret for 20 years?"

American origins?

The most popular theory is that an American (or a group of Americans) were behind the geoglyph.

Immediately after it was discovered, a series of press releases were anonymously faxed to the Marree Hotel and to newspaper The Advertiser, describing "the world's largest work of art." However, people quickly noticed that the writing used American spelling and language, including the use of miles instead of kilometers.

500-year-old Vatican mystery solved

More evidence emerged pointing to an American creator, including a buried plaque bearing the image of an American flag and the Olympic rings.

However, many Australians, including Smith, believe these clues to be red herrings.

An alternative theory credits Aboriginal artist Bardius Goldberg with the work. Goldberg, who lived in Alice Springs, had apparently told friends he was responsible for the Marree Man. However, this was never confirmed, and Goldberg died in 2002.

Some have theorized that it was done by the Australian army. Others yet insist it was the US Air Force, leaving a parting gift after they left Woomera in the late 1990s.

The harsh desert environment took its toll on the Marree Man, and with little maintenance, its lines began fading. However, locals plowed the lines back in 2016, keeping the Man and the mystery alive.
__label__politics (CNN) If Democrats are going to have a realistic shot of winning the Senate, they will have to win the races in two of the states with primaries on Tuesday: Arizona and Florida. If they lose either one, their chance to win the Senate goes down precipitously.

Democrats have an uphill battle to take back the Senate in November. They need a net pickup of two seats, and only nine of the 35 seats up for election in 2018 are currently held by Republicans. Ten of the Democrats (or independents who caucus with the Democrats) occupy seats in states President Donald Trump won in 2016.

Arizona ranks as the Democrats' top pickup opportunity in 2018. It is one of only two seats with Republican senators and taking place in states that Trump won by fewer than 5 points or lost. It is the only state that meets this description where no incumbent is running for re-election. (Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring.)

Stay up to date on key election dates and other events, such as town halls and debates, as they get added throughout the year. Subscribe on your Google or Apple calendar.

Arizona is also a state that may be becoming more purple. It hasn't had a Democratic senator since Dennis DeConcini left the chamber in 1995. Yet Arizona was one of the few states where Trump's 2016 margin was smaller than Mitt Romney's was in 2012.

Likely Democratic nominee Kyrsten Sinema looks to take full advantage of Democratic gains. Sinema, who is the second most moderate Democrat in the House, all but cleared the field upon announcing her entry into the race last year.

Her probable opponent is Republican Rep. Martha McSally, who also has a fairly moderate voting record. McSally, though, has had to fight her way through a tough three-way primary against the more conservative Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. The latest polling shows a clear McSally advantage in the primary, which no doubt pleases those who want a Republican to win in the fall. Her primary battle, however, may have cost her. McSally has had to adopt some more conservative and Trump-friendly rhetoric.

Sinema has held a consistent general-election lead over McSally in the area of 5 to 10 percentage points. This same polling has both candidates under 50%. That could give McSally room to grow, once the general election campaign begins.

Still, Sinema is a favorite for the fall campaign. Candidates in her polling position win about 75% of the time. That's necessary good news for Democratic Senate hopes, though far from sufficient. Without winning in Arizona, Democrats would need to win in Tennessee (where Trump won by 26 points in 2016) or Texas (where Republican Sen. Ted Cruz continues to be ahead of Democratic wunderkind Beto O'Rourke). They'd, of course, also need to win in Nevada, where Trump lost by 2 points, but where Republican Sen. Dean Heller has managed to stay neck and neck with Democrat Jacky Rosen.

The Florida Senate race is something altogether different.

Normally, senators like Democrat Bill Nelson don't lose re-election. In the over 110 times since 1982 when an incumbent senator of the opposition party has run in a midterm, the incumbent has lost only four times. Three of those four times were in years (1998 and 2002) when the president had an approval rating north of 60%. Trump's approval rating is in the low 40s. And all of those four occurrences happened in states that were reliable votes for the president's party in presidential elections. Florida is a swing state, on the other hand.

Even when Republican Gov. Rick Scott entered the race, it looked like it was going to be a tough road for Republicans. Scott had barely won his two elections in 2010 and 2014, and both of those took place in very good Republican years.

In other words, this should have been a race that Nelson won fairly easily. That has not been the case.

Scott has led in most of the recent polling by low single digits. Florida insiders too believe that Scott is a small favorite over Nelson.

Just what the heck has happened? Two key factors are working in Scott's favor.

First, he has raised a lot more money than Nelson . This has allowed him to spend a lot more on the airwaves.

Second, Scott's simply more popular than he was during his two runs for governor. Thanks in part to his actions after Hurricane Irma, his approval rating rose significantly . For the first time in his governorship, Scott has seen an extended period of positive net approval (approval minus disapproval) ratings.

It's far too early to count Nelson out, though. The fundamentals of this race still favor him.

Most of the polls that have given Scott a lead have been of lower quality (i.e. non-live interviewer or not transparent about their data collection), and Nelson had a small lead in earlier polls of higher quality.

Further, Nelson actually has a cash-on-hand advantage, though Scott has personal wealth he can spend. Still, you can be sure national Democrats will be spending a ton on the race in the final two months of the campaign.

Democrats, simply put, cannot afford to not put in a vigorous effort in Florida. Like with Arizona, Democrats need every win they can get, and this race on paper shouldn't be as difficult as other states. Democratic incumbents in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota face much tougher electoral winds.

A loss in Florida, like in Arizona, would make a tough Senate map nearly impossible for Democrats.
__label__world (CNN) At 6 am when Gutama Habro arrived at the Target Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the line for tickets already snaked around the block. Within hours, 20,000 fans had packed the venue. "People around me were crying," says Gutama, a 28-year-old medical laboratory scientist. "Seeing this was a dream come true."

Gutama wasn't at a pop concert. This was the final leg of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's three-city American tour. Held in July, it was the first time the 42-year-old had visited the more than 251,000 Ethiopians living in the United States, many in self-imposed exile -- fleeing ethnic clashes, violence, and political instability in their homeland. "The level of hope was something we had not seen since the election of Barack Obama," says Mohammed Ademo, an activist who fled to the US in 2002 and founded OPride.com , a news outlet that was blocked for years at home.

Since taking office on April 2, Africa's youngest head of government has electrified Ethiopia with a dizzying array of liberal reforms credited by many with saving the country from civil war. Abiy has freed thousands of political prisoners , unblocked hundreds of censored websites, ended the 20-year state of war with Eritrea, lifted a state of emergency, and planned to open key economic sectors to private investors, including the state-owned Ethiopian Airlines.

In the capital city of Addis Ababa, taxi windscreens are plastered with Abiy stickers, while citizens are changing their Whatsapp and Facebook profile pictures to pro-Abiy slogans and spending their money on Abiy T-shirts. Elias Tesfaye, a garment factory owner, says that in the past six weeks he has sold 20,000 T-shirts bearing Abiy's face, which cost about 300 birr ($10) each. In June, an estimated four million people attended a rally Abiy gave in the capital's Meskel Square.

Tom Gardner, a British journalist who lives in Addis Ababa, says there is an almost religious fervor to what has been dubbed " Abiymania ." "People talk quite openly about seeing him as the son of God or a prophet," he says.

On the verge of civil war

A prime minister's wardrobe doesn't often attract attention. But the blazers with purple or green and gold trim that Abiy wore on his US tour were not just a natty pick: this was traditional Oromo attire.

Left, Abiy Ahmed in Washington and, right, with his family in Minnesota on his US tour in July 2018.

That's significant. Abiy is Ethiopia's first prime mister from the country's biggest ethnic group, the Oromo, who make up one third of its 100 million people. Ethiopia has more than 90 ethnic groups , and for decades the country's politics have been organized along these divisive lines.

In 1991, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) toppled the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam, whose communist regime had imposed military rule since 1974 . Mengistu had thousands of his political opponents murdered and ignored a famine that killed one million people -- a tragedy that found a global spotlight in the 1984 Band Aid charity record "Feed The World."

Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1980.

The TPLF began as a small band of guerrilla fighters from the Tigray ethnic group, who account for six percent of Ethiopia's population. As the party prepared to assume power, in 1989, it engineered a coalition with larger ethnic groups, such as the Oromo and Amhara, to bolster its legitimacy. The catch? "The TPLF formed the rest of the parties -- they don't have an autonomous existence," says Tsedale Lemma, editor-in-chief of the Addis Standard , an independent newspaper.

of other ethnic groups prompted an Until Abiy, that coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), ruled with an iron fist. Government marginalizationof other ethnic groups prompted an exodus of professionals from the nation and secession cries from the Oromo at home. Government plans to annex Oromo farmland in order to expand Addis Ababa saw civil unrest explode across Ethiopia in recent years.

As the country disintegrated into chaos, in February 2018 Prime Minister Haile Mariam Desalegn did something African leaders rarely do. He quit. A state of emergency was called for the second time in 18 months and an internet blackout followed, including in the capital. "It was devastating for the economy," says Tsedale.

"Everyone feared that if Ethiopia didn't get an Oromo leader then the nation would collapse into civil war," says Abel Wabela, a former engineer for Ethiopian Airlines, who was imprisoned for blogging about democracy under the previous administration. "Luckily, we got Abiy."

The selfie prime minister

Abiy is nothing like those who came before him. He hugs politicians in public, takes selfies with fans, and doesn't just smile for the cameras, he beams. His message to Ethiopia's ethnic groups has been: "Take down the wall, build the bridge."

Abiy embraces Tamagn Beyene, an outspoken critic of the previous Ethiopian governments, during his American tour.

In Minnesota, he asked the crowd to "medemer," literally, be added to one another. "If you want to be the pride of your generation," he said, "then you must decide that Oromos, Amharas, Wolaytas, Gurages, and Siltes are all equally Ethiopian." In a country physically carved up along ethnic lines (many groups were given their own region to govern in 1991, as the country moved to ethnic federalist politics), this is a revolutionary message.

"He talks in a language people understand," says Ademo, who joined Abiy's US tour as a consultant on the American diaspora. Embracing the previous government's enemies is a classic Abiy move. "People cry because for the first time they see light at the end of the tunnel. People have finally found the leader they've been waiting for."

It helps that Abiy's own identity bridges ethnic groups: his father is a Muslim Oromo while his mother was a Christian. He is fluent in Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya as well as English. In Minnesota, he addressed the crowd in all three of these Ethiopian languages, as well as some rehearsed Somali for attendees from Ethiopia's restive eastern region.

His professional experience is also diverse. In the 1990s, Abiy was a United Nations peacekeeper in Rwanda, he subsequently headed Ethiopian cyber security agency INSA and served as minister of science and technology before shrewdly leaving the embattled central government to become deputy president of the contentious Oromia region, aligning himself with that area's struggle.

in protest against government land grabs and ethnic killings. "If I had gone back, I would have been As Abiymania swells, there is talk of a " brain gain ." Ethiopians are being pulled into his orbit, and back to a country that now has the fastest growing economy in Africa. Ademo returned to Addis last month. Olympic Marathon silver medalist Feyisa Lilesa plans to do the same in September. He has been exiled in the US since crossing his arms at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Gamesin protest against government land grabs and ethnic killings. "If I had gone back, I would have been killed ," says the runner. Former political prisoner and democracy blogger Atnaf Berhane says that in Addis "for the first time in six years, I don't feel like I'm going to be arrested."

Feyisa Lilesa protests as he takes second place in the men's marathon race at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.

Abiy's own safety might not be so assured. In June, a bomb was detonated at a rally he gave in Meskel Square, in what was seen as an assassination attempt . While Tsedale says many of the old guard are "disgruntled" by Abiy's disrupting of their political hegemony, there is also a pragmatic "reformed wing" of the TPLF that backs his leadership.

Arkebe Oqubay, a founding member of the EPRDF, senior figure within the TPLF and government minister, appears to be in their ranks. "Abiy is young and he brings vigor," he says. "The whole country should get behind him."

A cult of personality?

Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed waves to the crowd at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa on June 23, 2018.

There's a slightly awkward sticking point in Abiy's success story. While he presents himself as a liberal champion, in four months in office he hasn't given an interview. Private media, for a time, stopped being invited to government events for "reasons we don't understand yet," Tsedale says. Consequently, a question mark hangs over much of Abiy's worldview and biography, other than the fact he is married with three daughters. On August 25, however, he did hold a three-hour press conference -- his first -- at which Tsedale says he seemed "relaxed and convincing."

Having already visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the US and Djibouti, Abiy is the region's "most active diplomat by some way," Gardner says. Ademo notes that he has taken tough questions from the public at multiple town halls.

Official news now comes almost exclusively via the Twitter account of Abiy's chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, who posts his boss' achievements in real time. As ethnic violence in rural areas has claimed lives in recent weeks, Abiy's silence and Fitsum's cheer leading have jarred. "You have people being lynched in Shashemene and then he [Fitsum] is tweeting about Abiy visiting the Jimma Industrial Park. It's ridiculous," says Mula Geta, an Ethiopian living in Tel Aviv, Israel.

And the government still appears to be turning off the internet during flashes of unrest.

Supporters of Ethiopian Prime Minister attend a rally on Meskel Square in Addis Ababa on June 23, 2018.

"The government should be doing more to address such violence and ensure there are credible investigations into killings," says Maria Burnett, associate director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch.

Furthermore, while Abiy has apologized for the torture that political prisoners endured in jail under previous governments, there is no sign that offending guards will face charges.

Ahmed Shide, minister of government communication affairs, did not reply to CNN's request for comment. Abiy did not reply to multiple CNN requests for interview.

We should be cautious of leaders who emerge and appear to be a messiah for everybody. Natasha Ezrow, professor in the department of government

Perhaps the biggest concern is that "Abiymania," and the faith it confers, will blind Ethiopians to the potential flaws of their leader, and weaken the democratic process. Natasha Ezrow, a professor in the department of government at Essex University in England, says: "We should be cautious of leaders who emerge and appear to be a messiah for everybody." Ethiopia, she adds, has "no institutions for democracy" and is "used to a strong man." Unless Abiy implements significant checks on his own power, then it will be hard to avoid a dictatorship, she says.

For now, Ethiopians worldwide are hoping that will not be the case.

"For a country like Ethiopia, Abiy is one in a million," says Geta. "He really could be one of the greatest leaders that Africa ever saw."
__label__politics Former President Barack Obama spoke of the present moment, where "so much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. Trafficking in bombast and insult. Phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear."

McCain, Obama said, "called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that."

Obama added: "What better way to honor John McCain's life of service than as best we can follow his example to prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, and in fact it is demanded of all of us as citizens of this great republic."

Concluding his remarks, Obama added, "That's perhaps how we honor him best, by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power, that there are some things that are worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding."

"At his best," Obama said, "John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt."

The former president walked out from behind the podium and into the open arms of Cindy McCain, and the two briefly embraced as she appeared to thank him for his remarks.
__label__politics (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence once argued the president of the United States should be held to the highest moral standards to determine whether he should resign or be removed from office.

Pence made the argument in two columns in the late 1990s, where he wrote that then-President Bill Clinton's admission of an affair with a White House intern and prior lies to the public about the matter, possibly under oath, meant Clinton should be removed from office.

Yet Pence also moved beyond the specifics of the Clinton case: He made a far-reaching argument about the importance of morality and integrity to the office of the presidency.

Pence wrote the columns in the late 1990s when he was a local Indiana radio host and prominent conservative voice in the state arguing Clinton had lost his moral authority to lead the country. One of the columns , "The Two Schools of Thought on Clinton," was posted on his now-defunct website for his radio talk show. Another column, "Why Clinton Must Resign or Be Impeached," was posted on his congressional campaign website. Both columns were archived by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The columns ran in various Indiana newspapers at the time but did not get national attention.

Dismissing the idea that the president is "just the like the rest of us," Pence wrote, "If you and I fall into bad moral habits, we can harm our families, our employers and our friends. The President of the United States can incinerate the planet. Seriously, the very idea that we ought to have at or less than the same moral demands placed on the Chief Executive that we place on our next door neighbor is ludicrous and dangerous.

__label__world Tham Luang caves, Thailand (CNN) The operation to rescue the remaining boys and their coach from a flooded cave in northern Thailand was expected to resume Monday morning, but heavy rain threatened to further complicate the mission.

Four of the 12 boys were extracted from the Tham Luang cave network in the Chiang Rai province Sunday evening, before the operation was suspended overnight to allow oxygen tanks to be refilled before rescue teams begin the next phase.

The four boys, who were taken to a Chiang Rai hospital for further medical examination, are said to be in good health, with their condition described by officials as "not that bad."

But rescue teams don't have an abundance of time. Rain began to fall on Sunday, and more rain is forecast throughout the coming days, which could undo the ongoing efforts to drain the flooded caverns where the other boys remain trapped.

"We have two obstacles: water and time," said Chiang Rai Gov. Narongsak Osotthanakorn earlier Sunday, as rain began to fall across the site near the cave entrance.

"This is what we have been racing against since day one," he said. "We have to do all we can, even though it is hard to fight the force of nature."

'A very smooth operation'

Sunday's mission went quicker than it had in drills over the last several days, according to Osotthanakorn.

Previously, the entire round trip through the cave network was thought to take about 11 hours. But the first of the four boys emerged from the cave entrance about nine hours after a team of 18 international cave diving experts went in to retrieve them.

An ambulance leaves the Tham Luang cave area after divers evacuated some of the 12 boys trapped with their coach for 15 days.

The boys wore "full face masks and the rescue divers carried them out through the passage in the cave complex," Osotthanakorn said in a news conference after the rescue.

"It was a very smooth operation today," he added.

While the governor would not confirm the identities of the four boys, he said the first one emerged at 5:40 p.m., followed by the second boy 10 minutes later. Two other boys emerged from the cave at 7:40 p.m. and 7:50 p.m.

Twelve boys -- aged between 11 and 16 -- and their coach, were discovered by two British divers on July 2, nine days after they abandoned their bicycles and disappeared into the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex.

Pressure mounting as rain dominates forecasts

Rescuers have a dwindling window of opportunity, with forecasters predicting the return of heavy monsoon rains in the coming days, effectively sealing off the cave until October.

It was the rain that stranded the boys and their coach inside the cave to begin with, after they ventured into the cave network last month.

"The heaviest rain has yet to come," said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Rain is forecast for at least the next three days.

Rescue teams have been helped by the fact that the rain stopped for several days, allowing water to be pumped out of the cave and making it possible for the four boys and specialist rescue teams to make the final leg of the journey on foot.

Osotthanakorn told reporters there would be a meeting Sunday evening to plan next steps, and that authorities want to ensure conditions are stable before beginning the next phase of the rescue.

A dangerous journey



Those still inside the cave are perched on a small muddy ledge 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) inside the cave complex, surrounded by floodwater and with a Those still inside the cave are perched on a small muddy ledge 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) inside the cave complex, surrounded by floodwater and with a limited supply of oxygen.

For the boys -- some of whom can't swim -- the most dangerous part of the journey out of the labyrinth cave system remains the first kilometer, in which they are required to pass through a flooded channel no wider than a person.

During this process, rescuers need to hold the boys' oxygen tanks in front of them and swim pencil-like through submerged holes. Having completed this section, the boys are then handed over to separate, specialist rescue teams, who help assist them through the remainder of the cave, much of which they can wade through.

Initially, officials said the strongest boys would be taken out of the cave first.

But Osottanakorn said on Sunday it would be up to boys and a doctor inside the cave with them to determine the order in which they would exit. That decision would also depend on a medical examination by the doctor.

"I don't know who will come out first," the governor added.

Divers have previously described conditions in the cave network as some of the most extreme they have ever faced.

The decision to move the boys using divers has not been taken lightly. On Friday, a former Thai Navy SEAL died while returning from an operation to deliver oxygen tanks to the cave.

Finnish volunteer diver Mikko Paasi, a long-term resident of Thailand, said the death of the Thai Navy SEAL had changed the mood on the ground and made real for rescuers just how dangerous the mission had become.

"Definitely, you can feel it that it has an effect, but we're moving on. Everyone is a professional so we're trying to put it away and avoid it happening again," he said, adding: "Everybody is focusing on getting these boys out -- keeping them alive or getting them out."

Families remain vigilant, hopeful

In the hours preceding the rescue, a letter the boys had sent to their families was published on the Thai SEALs' Facebook page. The letter shows the boys in good spirits despite their ordeal.

In neat blue handwriting, 11-year-old Chanin Viboonrungruang, the youngest of the group, told his parents not to worry, and said he was looking forward to eating fried chicken.

JUST WATCHED CNN talks to father waiting for trapped son Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN talks to father waiting for trapped son 02:37

His parents, along with other families, have maintained a constant vigil at the site since the boys became trapped.

On reading the letter Saturday evening, Chanin's father, Tanawut Viboonrungruang, said he felt a great sense of relief. "I had been worried about my son, that he would be exhausted, he would be tired," he said.

The aunt and grandmother of one of the boys, Prajak Sutham, said earlier in the day they learned the rescue effort was underway via Facebook, and were anxiously awaiting news that Prajak had made it out safely.

"It's like I'm counting every second," said Salisa Promjak, the aunt. "I want to see his face. I want to see how he gets out, how they get him out ... I am so happy."

Onlookers watch and cheer as ambulances deliver boys rescued from a cave in northern Thailand to hospital in Chiang Rai, Thailand, after they were transpored by helicopter on July 8, 2018.

Asked what she would say when she first sees her grandson, Kiawakham Chantaphoon said, "Grandma loves you the most in the whole world."

They also wanted to express their gratitude to the rescue teams working to free Prajak and his teammates.

"As a cousin and as a representative of all 13 families, I cannot find words to explain our feelings and how glad and grateful we are," said Promjak. "Just the words 'thank you' is not enough to explain all the feelings we have for them."

Rescued boys begin the recovery process

Now that the first of the boys have been taken to a nearby hospital, doctors there will begin evaluating the impact to their long-term health

One of the primary concerns will be the boys' exposure to a lack of oxygen, said Dr. Darria Long Gillespie of the University of Tennessee. "As soon as they get out, that's what they'll be checking: their oxygen levels and their breathing."

Thai officials said Friday that oxygen levels inside the cave plummeted to a dangerous 15% -- shy of the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's " optimal range " of oxygen, which is between 19.5% and 23.5%.

As oxygen drops below the lower threshold of the optimal level, the body begins to undergo changes and may face the serious risk of hypoxia, the condition that causes altitude sickness, according to OSHA.

The boys will also be checked for malnutrition, dehydration and an array of other health effects.

(CNN) If Barack Obama had behaved the way President Donald Trump has, Republicans would be demanding investigations and an impeachment proceeding.

In fact, more than a year after Trump took office, Republican outrage over anything and everything Obama or Hillary Clinton-related still knows no bounds. In fact, for fun, I periodically tune into Fox News, because on that network Clinton is actually president -- at least on the days they aren't suggesting Barack Obama still is, and he's to blame for some current wrong.

They are so petty that GOP Rep. Peter King was once outraged that Obama dared to wear a tan suit to a press conference! Imagine if Obama had saluted a general in the brutal North Korean military the way Trump did at the summit in Singapore this week.

Beyond that, congressional Republicans commissioned hearing after hearing when it came to Obama and Clinton. For example, GOP-controlled congressional committees conducted five probes surrounding the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. They even appointed a special panel that investigated the Benghazi incident for over 2½ years at a price tag of nearly $8 million of our tax dollars.

Even today, the Republicans in Congress are still investigating Hillary Clinton's emails. And Trump recently alluded to the need for additional investigations of Obama, when he tweeted: "Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation?"

But where are the investigations by Congress of Trump -- or even the outrage over Trump's apparent misconduct and possible crimes? Sure, a few brave and soon-to-retire Republicans have spoken out, but it seems the majority of the GOP fears Trump's "cult," or as I call it "Cult 45." In the spirit of transparency, good government and rooting out corruption, there need to be congressional investigations into a variety of Trump-related activities.

Just imagine...

1. If Obama had a chain of hotels where foreign government officials and others trying to curry favor with the Obama administration stayed, the Republican Party leadership would have been demanding investigations into his finances. And yet, they remain silent as Trump stands accused of violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause for potentially doing just that. In fact, there is a federal lawsuit pending by Maryland and Washington, D.C., attorney generals alleging Trump personally profited from foreign dignitaries staying at his Washington hotel -- which they deem a violation of this anti-corruption clause.

2. If Obama had stayed at his own hotel and made taxpayers foot the bill for his protection, the Republican Party leadership would have been demanding a full accounting of his costs to the taxpayer. And yet, they remain silent, even though Trump has been using American tax dollars to cover his stay at his hotels. Trump has stayed at his own properties well over 100 times since being sworn in as President and has charged taxpayers for services he used while there. For example, Trump billed us over $130,000 for the Secret Service's use of golf carts while protecting him at his golf courses.

3. If Obama had a charity with questionable spending habits, the Republican Party leadership would have called for an investigation into his charity. (Lord knows they have been doing it to Hillary Clinton regarding the Clinton Foundation!) And yet, it remains unlikely we will hear any Republicans call for investigations into Trump's charity despite the fact that the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit on Thursday alleging Trump and his three eldest children engaged in "persistently illegal conduct" at the President's personal charity.

4. If Obama had lied about a letter he helped Sasha or Malia write, the Republican Party leadership would have branded him dishonest and questioned his integrity. And yet, they remain silent, even as news breaks that Trump helped his son draft a misleading letter about the nature of his meeting with Russian nationals at Trump Tower, one which was set up to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.

5. If Obama's personal lawyer had sold access to the White House, the Republican Party leadership would have called for an immediate hearing to discuss both the lawyer's conduct and any potential knowledge Obama had of the situation. And yet, they remain silent, even as more and more stories emerge regarding Michael Cohen's selling of information and access to the White House.

6. If Obama had been accused of sexual misconduct, the Republican Party leadership would have called for his impeachment. (They certainly didn't hesitate when Bill Clinton was president.) And yet, they remain silent, despite the fact that Trump has been accused by at least 15 women of inappropriate behavior, including sexual harassment or assault.

7. If Obama had tried to use a government institution to silence his opposition, the Republican Party leadership would have ordered he cease and desist -- and then held a hearing about it. As a reminder, when the IRS allegedly was unfair to tea party groups, the GOP Congress sprang into action holding hearings. And yet they remain silent as Trump asks the US Postmaster to raise the postage on Amazon because Trump wants to hurt his frequent Trump critic, The Washington Post, which has the same owner.

8. If Obama had fired the FBI director who was leading an investigation into his campaign, Republican Party leadership would have accused him of obstructing justice. And yet, they remained silent when Trump fired James Comey. Yes, I know Robert Mueller is investigating this, but Congress should be as well.

9. If Obama refused to release his tax returns, Republican Party leadership would have accused him of hiding sordid business dealings. And yet, they remain silent, even though Trump has yet to release his tax returns to the public.

10. If Obama's daughters had potentially benefited from a deal their father had done with a foreign country, Republican Party leadership would have demanded a thorough investigation into the President's family's business dealings. And yet, they remain silent, even after Ivanka Trump recently received approval for trademarks from the Chinese government -- in the same time frame as her father agreed to help Chinese-owned phone company, ZTE.

And the list goes on.

If Democrats reclaim either or both chambers this fall, you can be certain they will begin to investigate these scandals. But until that day comes, we can expect more double standards, as the GOP protects Trump at the expense of the American people.

1. Immigration

Outrage at the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents who illegally cross the border with Mexico continues to grow. On Father's Day, a group of Democratic lawmakers visited a facility where children are being held, and they were angry at what they saw. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley said Trump's "zero tolerance" policy should be called "zero humanity." Reporters toured the warehouse-like building too and described seeing hundreds of children in chain-link cages , apparently sleeping on the floor on mattresses with mylar blankets.

CNN's Stephen Collinson and Lauren Fox wonder how long the controversial practice will be politically sustainable amid the growing wave of criticism. Former first lady Laura Bush added her voice to the complaints, calling the policy "cruel." And current first lady Melania Trump said she "hates" to see kids separated from their families and "believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart."

President Trump suggested that he's using the issue to get Democrats to submit to his immigration demands, which include funding for a border wall and curbs on legal immigration. He also falsely claimed the Democrats are responsible for his policy. He's supposed to meet with House Republicans tomorrow to hash out a possible path forward on a pair of immigration bills.

2. New Jersey shooting

Twenty-two people were hurt in a shooting at a 24-hour art festival in Trenton. The suspect, Tahaij Wells, is believed to have been killed by police and had just been released from prison. The shooting was tied to gang violence and wasn't an act of terror, police said. Before the shooting, police had been trying to shut the festival down because of several fights. As many as 1,000 people were in the area when the shooting started early Sunday morning.

3. Colombia presidential election

Ivan Duque is projected to win Colombia's presidential election , held yesterday. A win by the social conservative is especially noteworthy because he's been openly opposed to the peace deal with FARC rebels that current President Juan Manuel Santos helped negotiate. Under the deal -- which ended a 50-year conflict that killed more than 220,000 people -- the rebels agreed to lay down their arms, exit the jungle and pursue their aims via politics rather than guerrilla warfare. While Duque has said he doesn't want to tear up the agreement, he also believes the peace pact is too lenient on former rebel fighters.

4. Migrant crisis

The 630 migrants who had been turned away by Italy and Malta arrived in Spain over the weekend, some of them singing and dancing as their ships reached the port city of Valencia. The migrants, who had spent a harrowing week at sea, were picked up off the coast of Libya. The group included at least 100 minors and seven pregnant women. France also offered to allow some of the migrants to settle there.

5. Video games

Today, the World Health Organization will add a new condition to its list of diseases: gaming disorder . Parents have often grumbled about "digital heroin," and the WHO announcement backs them up. Gaming disorder, the group says, has characteristics similar to substance abuse and gambling disorders: taking precedence over other activities, loss of control of these behaviors and significant distress and impairment of relationships. But not all psychologists agree the designation is warranted. One said that in his experience, those addicted to gaming are using it more as a coping mechanism for either anxiety or depression.

AND FINALLY ...

Getting it in
__label__world (CNN) A police officer who swapped places with a female hostage during an attack by an ISIS supporter on a supermarket in southern France has died of his wounds, French authorities said.

Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 45, was shot in the neck Friday after offering to take the place of a woman during a gunman's assault on the Super U supermarket in Trèbes.

Police found two unexploded homemade bombs, a 7.65 mm pistol and a hunting knife when they searched the market after the attack, a French judicial source told CNN.

Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, here in 2013, was hailed as a hero by authorities.

The attacker, Radouane Lakdim, 26, a Moroccan-born French national, was a petty criminal already on the radar of French police for his links to radical Salafist networks, authorities said.

When he burst into the supermarket Friday, he shouted he was a soldier from ISIS, witnesses said, before opening fire and killing a worker and a customer. He was shot dead by police on the scene.

"Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already contributed so much," French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. "By giving his life to end the murderous escapade of a jihadist terrorist, he died a hero."

Interior Minister Gérard Collomb announced the officer's death Saturday, which raised the number of victims in the gunman's rampage to four.

The attacker killed two other people and wounded more than a dozen others in the supermarket raid. Before then, he had killed another person Friday while stealing a car.

"France will never forget his heroism, his bravery, his sacrifice," Collomb said on Twitter.

He 'gave his life for the freedom of the hostages'

As Friday's attack was underway, Beltrame offered to exchange himself for one of the female hostages held inside the Super U supermarket, Collomb said. He was shot while entering the market.

Beltrame had left his phone on so police could hear his interactions with the gunman, Collomb said.

As soon as they heard gunfire, police went in and killed the gunman.

Police respond to the hostage situation Friday in the southern French town of Trèbes.

Beltrame died Friday night, police said.

"I bow to the courage, the sense of sacrifice and the exemplary nature of this officer who gave his life for the freedom of the hostages," the French National Police said on Twitter.

Illustrious career as officer

Married with no children, Beltrame had served in the French military police and received a number of awards for bravery.

He served in Iraq in 2005, and was given an award for bravery in 2007, Macron said. For four years, he was a commander in the Republican Guard, which provides security at the Élysée Palace, home of the French president.

In 2012, he was knighted in France's prestigious Legion of Honor. Beltrame also was secretary-general in the Ecology Ministry for four years.

Last year Beltrame was appointed deputy commander of the anti-terror police in the Aude region.

According to the newspaper La Dépêche du Midi, Beltrame led a simulated terror attack in December on a supermarket for training purposes, similar to the one Friday in which he lost his life.

"His leadership skills, his willingness, his unfailing commitment were appreciated by everyone, especially in the development of counterterrorism capacity in the Aude police force," Macron said.

How the rampage unfolded

Before the supermarket, the gunman stole a car, killing one person in the vehicle and wounding another, the interior minister said.

The gunman then shot at four National Police officers who were jogging in Carcassonne. The driver tried to run the officers down. One of them was wounded, but he was not in serious condition.

French police block access to Trèbes as they respond to the hostage situation Friday.

"People were absolutely calm before and never thought that there could be an attack in a town like this," Collomb told reporters, adding that the risk of terrorism in France remained "very high."

Two others detained

On Friday, police detained a woman who was "very close" to the gunman Lakdim and "shared his life," prosecutor François Molins said.

A second person was arrested Saturday, the Paris prosecutor's office told CNN. The unidentified male, born in 2000, was described as a friend of Lakdim's.

Macron: 'We've paid the price'

France remained under a state of emergency for about two years after the Paris attacks. It was lifted late last year.

"Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack," Macron told reporters Friday. "We've paid the price of the danger of the terrorist threat in blood for several years."

Macron said the investigation will answer several questions -- when and how the gunman was radicalized, and where he got a weapon.

The ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency described the gunman Friday as a "soldier" of the militant group but offered no evidence ISIS had any contact with him.

"This attack has been claimed by ISIS, and it is currently being analyzed," Macron said.
__label__politics (CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is ABC Monday Night Football MIKE theme by Edd Kalehoff.

Polls of the week: Four internal House polls released this week by groups aligned with Democratic or liberal causes. Conservative and Republican groups released no internal House polls this week. This is part of a pattern seen this year with left-wing groups putting out 93% of the partisan polls collected by FiveThirtyEight compared to only 7% by right-wing groups.

The House of Representatives is difficult to predict because non-partisan polling for individual districts is limited and often not that accurate. Much of the polling released is done by partisan groups.

The obvious problem with partisan-sponsored polls is that it tends to only see the light of day when it looks good for the side who is conducting the poll.

But, of course, a group first needs to get a poll with good results for their side to actually release it. This got me thinking that if one side fields a lot of polls that end up favorable to their side, then maybe they're more likely to release more internal polls than other side.

It turns out that this has been true in past years.

Earlier this year, I collected House district level polling since 2006. For each campaign cycle from 2006-2016, I looked at what percentage of House internal polls were put out by left-wing groups compared to right-wing groups and compared it to the election result.

In every year but one, left-wing groups have put out more internal polls relative to right-wing groups. Still, there is a clear relationship between how many internal polls each side is releasing and the election results. The more internal polls put out by left-wing groups relative to right-wing groups, the better Democrats tend to do in House elections.

For example, 2006 was the year in which left-wing groups ended up putting out their highest share of internal polls relative to right-wing groups. That cycle, they put out 77% of the internal polls and Democrats had a net gain of 30 House seats in that election.

Contrast that to 2010, when Republicans had a net gain of 63 seats in the House. That cycle left-wing groups put out just 35% of the internal polls released by either side.

Of course, we're not close to November yet. Based upon prior election cycles there will be a bit of a reversion to the mean. That is, left-wing groups will probably have a clear edge in polls released come November 2018, but it won't be as large as the 93% to 7% advantage it is today.

At this point in the 2006 cycle, Democrats had a somewhat similar 85% to 15% lead in percentage of internal polls put out to the public. That declined by the end of the election year.

Democrats, though, would surely take a 2006-like wave (or something a little bit better). It would be enough to get the net gain of 23 seats to take back the House.

Now, there is no guarantee that 2018 will look better or even like 2006. We're only dealing with a sample size of six elections here. This year right-wing groups may be withholding good looking internal polls for some unknown reason.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is considering Washington attorney Pat Cipollone as a possible successor to White House counsel Don McGahn, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.

Cipollone, a partner at the Washington law firm Stein Mitchell Cipollone Beato & Missner, is a seasoned litigator and former Justice Department official who served during President George H.W. Bush's administration. But he came to know Trump after advising the President and his legal team concerning the special counsel's investigation, a source familiar with the matter said.

Cipollone becomes the second person whose name has been floated as a potential McGahn replacement. White House attorney Emmet Flood, who handles the White House's response to the special counsel's investigation, is also a top contender to succeed McGahn

Cipollone did not immediately return a request for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said: "We have no personnel announcements at this time."

Jay Sekulow, counsel to the President, praised Cipollone as a "brilliant attorney."

"I have had the privilege to work with him and can attest to his skill, integrity and knowledge of the law. If selected by the President, he would make an outstanding White House counsel," Sekulow said.

Cipollone's law firm notes that he is experienced in "a wide variety of cases, including complex maters" such as class action lawsuits, regulatory disputes involving federal agencies, congressional investigations and financial matters.

Cipollone also has "substantial expertise in defamation counseling and litigation," according to his law firm biography.

Trump could also choose to keep Flood in his position handling the response to the special counsel's investigation while bringing in another attorney to handle the more traditional tasks of the White House counsel, particularly if Republicans lose the House and Democrats launch a series of investigations into the White House.
__label__politics (CNN) Comedian Michelle Wolf's savage takedown of everyone from President Donald Trump to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders to the media was -- and will be -- the talk of Saturday Night's White House correspondents' dinner in Washington.

Some -- mostly on the left -- saw it is a speak-truth-to-power moment à la Stephen Colbert's speech at the 2006 White House correspondents' dinner . Others -- mostly on the right -- viewed it as a vile, hate-filled address that was neither funny nor appropriate.

Most journalists in the room -- and I was among them -- were largely quiet during Wolf's speech, particularly the second half when she got very personal about Sanders. (No, this does not mean journalists are humorless or can't laugh at themselves -- so save it.)

I took a bunch of my notes on my phone during Wolf's speech. I thought I'd share them -- and expand on them -- here. These are in no order other than how they occurred to me. (You can watch the whole speech yourself here .)

Wolf had zero interest in playing to the room

Introducing the "Daily Show" comic, White House Correspondents' Association President Margaret Talev praised Wolf as someone who was very much not part of the world of Washington. That was seen as a good thing, given that the criticism of Washington and its denizens since the election of Trump is that they/we are deeply out of touch with normal Americans. (A coastal comedian is not exactly "regular" people, but whatever.) I wonder whether Talev thought Wolf's I-could-care-less-about-any-of-you approach was such a great idea after the comedian's speech.

Most comedians who speak at the correspondents' dinner take a fair number of shots at the attendees in the room. But they also play along with theme of the night, which attempts to be a celebration of the free and independent media as well as a chance to shine a light on some of the best journalists in the country.

Wolf didn't do that. She wanted to napalm the room. And she did. Unapologetically.

Wolf went for lots of low-hanging fruit

There are LOTS of way to go after Sanders. I personally think that she is overly antagonistic to the reporters who cover the White House and misleads on the regular. But to make fun of Sanders' makeup? ("I think she's very resourceful, like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's lies," said Wolf.) Like, really?

I know lots of liberals will -- and already have via Twitter -- painted the attacks on Sanders as the press secretary getting what she deserved. I don't subscribe to that idea. Sanders showed up, sat on the dais and played along. She knew she was likely to get made fun of. But she would have no reasonable expectation that Wolf would go after her looks and refer to her as an "Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women."

I'm stunned that Sanders sat five feet away from Wolf and just took it.

Being funny is one thing. Bullying people because you can is another. And Wolf's treatment of Sanders was bullying.

And, yes, by the way, Trump is a massive bully. Making fun of a disabled reporter, stereotyping ethnic groups, attacking reporters for how they look -- all of that stuff is totally and completely unacceptable. And he knows exactly what he is doing, which makes it worse.

But two wrongs don't make it right. Because Trump bullied a disabled reporter doesn't mean Wolf should be able to bully Sarah Sanders. Bullying is bullying. And it's wrong. Always.

Wolf's criticism of the media was (generally) on point

The most powerful line of Wolf's speech, which will inevitably get overshadowed by what she said about Sanders, was this on the media and Trump:

"He has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him."

The first sentence there is 100% right. It is absolutely beyond debate that Trump has been good for the news business. The amount of news he creates coupled with the number of people who consume news about him has made cable news and print media more relevant (and profitable) than ever before.

The second sentence I take some issue with. Yes, cable ran Trump's primary speeches because he said and did things that no one else would do -- and that people would watch. And, yes, when I was at The Washington Post, I wrote about Trump regularly because he said and did things that no one else did.

But that, to me, is different than "creating" Trump. Donald Trump's candidacy was formed and sharpened by an angry and embittered GOP electorate who was sick of their own party, of Washington, of the media, of everything. He was rising whether the media covered him wall to wall or not; he was the angry id of the GOP. The media didn't create that.

The abortion stuff was beyond the pale

Here's Wolf's joke about Vice President Mike Pence's opposition to abortion: "He thinks abortion is murder which, first of all, don't knock it 'til you try it — and when you do try it, really knock it. You know, you've got to get that baby out of there."

Does anyone think this joke is funny? You can hate abortion and think it is murder. You can feel as though it's not the government's business what you do with your body and how you handle your own life. But, does anyone celebrate abortion -- even jokingly?

Wolf got exactly what she wanted

Don't be fooled: Wolf knew exactly what she was doing on Saturday night. She knew that the speech -- at least in parts -- was likely to go over like a lead balloon in the room. And that it would stir huge amounts of controversy in its wake.

THAT WAS THE POINT.

Ask yourself this: Did the average person know who Wolf was before Saturday night? (I will admit, I did not. And, yes, I know Wolf had never heard of me either.) Search interest in her soared last night and continued to spike Sunday morning, according to Google Trends . She is the talk of every Sunday talk show. She will be a regular topic on cable TV -- and late-night TV -- this week.

(CNN) With all due respect to Jeff Bezos and other billionaires who plan to spend billions of dollars of their personal wealth on space travel, hundreds of millions of children who lack access to basic health care and schooling more urgently need help right here on Earth.

The world economy is pumping trillions of dollars into the accounts of a few thousand people. These riches should be directed first and foremost to end the millions of needless deaths caused by extreme poverty, and to educate the hundreds of millions of children who lack schooling. The billionaires would still have enough left over to indulge their longing for mega-yachts, personal space ships, private tropical islands, and other conspicuous consumption.

The digital age has created winner-take-all markets in information -- including our personal data -- and Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergei Brin, and others are giddily reaping the benefits. In the past dozen years, according to Forbes Magazine, the number of billionaires and their net worth have both roughly tripled, from 793 billionaires with $2.6 trillion in net worth in 2006 to around 2,200 billionaires with $9.1 trillion as of March this year.

The flood of wealth to the top vastly outpaces economic growth. Much of the wealth reflects the redistribution of income from low-skilled workers, whose jobs and earnings are being lost to robots and artificial intelligence, to the super-rich owners of these "smart" systems. National income is shifting away from lower-skilled labor to the owners of high tech , including key technologies whose development was originally taxpayer-funded, like the Internet itself and Google's search engine.

The system is rigged for those at the top. The tech giants divert their mega-wealth offshore, usually with the connivance of the IRS, which turns a blind eye on outrageous schemes that reassign US-based intellectual property to overseas tax havens.

The companies harvest our personal data, for which they pay nothing, to earn their fortunes. They are given patents that create 20-year artificial monopolies on technologies that should be in the public domain.

The billionaires and the corporations they own use campaign donations and media power to cajole our "representatives" in Congress to represent them rather than us. The result is tax cuts and tax gimmicks for the billionaires, and massive deficits and debt left for us and our children to repay. Companies like Amazon entice cities to join the fiscal race to the bottom, as they compete to attract Amazon through offers of local tax breaks and publicly financed infrastructure.

The wealth at the top is rising so rapidly that even when Bill and Melinda Gates, the greatest philanthropists of our age, nobly give away several billion dollars each year to fight disease and hunger, their wealth soars anyway, with new capital gains vastly outpacing their giving. In 2010, Gates pledged to give away at least half his wealth and called on other rich individuals to do the same. At that time he was worth $53 billion. Today, his net worth is $94.8 billion.

Nearly 200 wealthy individuals have joined the Giving Pledge over the past eight years, fewer than 10% of the billionaires. Moreover, there is no reporting or accountability of their actual giving. All in all, most of the world's richest people have not yet joined the battle to end poverty. Yet their wealth is so vast that these few individuals could dramatically improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people.

Hundreds of millions of impoverished children live without access to basic health care or schooling. Around 5.6 million children under the age of five die each year because there is no clinic to safeguard their births, help them, if necessary, to take their first breath, provide life-saving antibiotics to fend off respiratory infections, or ensure timely access to a $1 dose of life-saving anti-malaria medicine in the event of an infective mosquito bite.

Hundreds of millions of children lack access to adequate public schools with trained teachers, electricity, books, and hygienic facilities. The result is that kids leave school after a few years without basic skills needed for the 21st century.

These debilitating conditions could be overcome for a tiny fraction of the vast wealth of the billionaires. A mere 1% of the billionaires' net worth each year would amount to around $91 billion, a sum that could ensure access to health care and education for the poorest children across the globe. (UNESCO estimates a global financing gap for education of $39 billion per year ; WHO professionals estimate a global financing gap for health of $20-$54 billion per yea r).

The billionaires should give this sum voluntarily, but when they don't, governments should put on a 1% net worth levy to fund the basic health and education needs of the world's poorest people.

When I led a commission 17 years ago that pointed out how modest levels of aid could make great strides against killer diseases like AIDS, TB, and malaria, I was told that the aid would be stolen, the poor would not adhere to the drug regimens, and so on. This is the blather of rich people.

In fact, when new institutions were established, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria and the US Government's PEPFAR program to fight AIDS, the programs saved millions of lives . Even so, despite the overwhelming evidence of their success, these worthy life-saving organizations remain bereft of adequate funding.

The mega-rich expect the adulation of the masses and often get it. Yet the forbearance of society for the antics of the mega-rich will soon wear thin. Too many people are suffering, too many lower-skilled workers are losing their jobs and earnings, too much wealth is being frivolously squandered, and too much power over our lives is being asserted by big tech and other corporate giants.

Donald Trump channeled the rising unhappiness into his electoral victory, but his trade wars and tax cuts for the rich only widen the divide. Real answers depend on redirecting the mega-wealth towards those in urgent need.

People as dynamic and capable as Jeff Bezos should aim their great wealth and energies toward the world's urgent challenges: extreme poverty, needless disease, illiteracy, and environmental devastation. For those who don't do so voluntarily, governments should put a levy on mega-wealth.

Once society's urgent needs are faced and financed head on, there will be enough time and wealth to reach for the stars.
__label__world (CNN) The historic moment of unity that brought them together for the first time in years is now over.

"Reality often brings people back to earth pretty quickly. The two states are technically at war, and there's no consensus in South Korea on how to deal with this, just as there's no real consensus in the US on how to deal with North Korea," said Andrew O'Neil, dean of the Griffith Business School at Griffith University in Australia.

"A mistake is often made that there's a hunger for a resolution at almost any cost on the part of the South Koreans. I think there were quite a few South Koreans who are very wary of [South Korean President] Moon Jae-in's attempts to reach out to the North," he said.

The two sides may be talking again, says O'Neil, but questions remain about what engagement with the North looks like going forward, and how the South can get Pyongyang to the table for talks. "The summits in 2000 and 2007 were essentially the result of South Korea bribing the elder Kim [Jong Il] to come to the summit," he argued.

I t's not clear whether Pyongyang, pleased with the diplomatic wins it sustained during the two weeks of the Games, will pull back, resume its missile tests, and continue with aggressive rhetoric towards not only the South, but also to South Korea's ally, the United States. It has already reacted hostilely to fresh US sanctions, calling them an "act of war."

Some North Korea experts believe the Olympic pause has given the regime valuable time to work on its nuclear program and that another launch is simply a matter of time.

It's been months since Pyongyang has carried out a missile test, and there are some who believe the regime will soon make good on its threat to follow up its alleged H-bomb test last year with a thermonuclear test in the atmosphere.

What matters then, is whether that diplomatic progress is obliterated with another launch, and if the North is prepared to lose that leverage at this point in its renewed dialogue with the South, as the US continues to look to tougher sanctions against Pyongyang.

On Monday, after meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong at the presidential palace in Seoul, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the US should ease its position on preconditions for talks.

"There is a need for the United States to lower the threshold for talks and North Korea should show its willingness to denuclearize," Moon said in a statement.

Talks with US?

Moon said that he'd met with the North Korean delegation in Pyeongchang before the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games and told them that North Korea-US talks should happen "as soon as possible." Moon in a statement on Sunday said the North Koreans agreed that "the inter-Korean relationship and North Korea-US relationship should develop together."

"We should not take them too seriously given that the North Koreans themselves have not made any public announcement that indicates any willingness to put their nuclear/missile programs on the table as part of a dialogue," O'Neil remarked. "Remember this is a US precondition for any meaningful dialogue."

The White House responded with cautious optimism to Moon's statement.

"We will see if Pyongyang's message today, that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization," the White House said in a statement.

"In the meantime, the United States and the world must continue to make clear that North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are a dead end," the statement continued.

Joseph Siracusa, a professor of human security and international diplomacy at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, said it wasn't clear what the North Koreans in Seoul were prepared to do to advance peace talks.

"What we do know, is I'm sure that the people who are going to the meetings are empowered to make some move on this," Siracusa said.

The talks didn't include presidential adviser Ivanka Trump, who was in South Korea to lead the US delegation at the closing ceremony. Like US Vice President Mike Pence at the opening event, Ivanka sat just feet away from the North Koreans, but barely gave them a sideways glance although she did stand up and clap as the joint Korean team entered the stadium.

The people attending the closing moments of the Games and staying for meetings in Seoul included Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman of the party's central committee and the former chief of North Korea's top military intelligence body.

The two sides will discuss the North's involvement in the upcoming Winter Paralympics. The talks will be held in the border village of Panmunjom on Tuesday at 10 a.m. local.

Kim Yong Chol is widely believed to have masterminded the 2010 sinking of the corvette Cheonan, a South Korean navy ship, killing 46 sailors. He is on a list of people sanctioned by both Seoul and Washington. During his recent trip to South Korea, Pence visited the Cheonan memorial and used the occasion to show that the US "stand(s) with our allies."

Propaganda victory

The Winter Olympics, says Siracusa, was a "propaganda victory" for Pyongyang. "They got themselves invited, they didn't have to pay the bill and for a couple of weeks they looked normal," he told CNN.

Most importantly, he says, North Korea's successful Games appearance -- cheering squads, a friendly Kim sibling and no defectors to the South -- also succeeded in driving a wedge between South Koreans who want reunification and rapprochement, and those who don't.

The North Korean Olympic team and the official delegation that comprised of Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo Jong and Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's ceremonial head of state, were closely watched everywhere they went. Competing athletes and cheer squads were met with South Korean protesters in some places, a cogent reminder that not everyone was thrilled with the red carpet rolled out for the visiting neighbors from the North.

"The North Koreans want reunification, but on their terms," said Siracusa. "The South Koreans would rather have a confederation with these people than a nuclear war. And this has also complicated the South Korean alliance with the US," he said.

"I think it has complicated the life of President Moon and whether he will do something with the Americans," he continued. "Moon has a promise through the Americans to talk without preconditions, but sanctions aren't going away until the North Koreans do something positive. What does that mean? It could mean anything."

Moon in the middle

Moon, a liberal who has declared he wanted to be remembered as the leader "who built a peaceful relationship between the North and the South," now has to balance his ambitions for peace with a disgruntled domestic population and an uneasy ally in Washington.

The North Korea and South Korea Olympic teams enter together under the Korean Unification Flag during the Parade of Athletes during the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games

Eurasia Group said in a briefing note it believed it will be difficult for Moon to sustain support for a North-South summit. It quoted several polls showing South Koreans' dissatisfaction with his decisions including the formation of a joint women's hockey team (over 72% opposed it), and having athletes march under a single flag (only 40% supported the move).

"Moreover, a Seoul University poll in January found only four out of 10 respondents believing that unification was necessary," the group said in a statement to the press. "Young people in their 20s and 30s are the most opposed to the idea of reunification."

The political right, the Eurasia Group argues, has been keen to criticize Moon's handling of the Olympics. "Kim [Jong Un]'s decision to hold a military parade on February 8 reinforced suspicions among conservatives and the broader public that he is not acting in good faith."

Undeterred ambitions

While hailing progress between the two countries last week, Moon warned about moving too quickly to talks in a bid to satisfy "impatient" hearts. He said that while the North and the South will move slowly to hold talks, the path to any kind of reconciliation necessarily runs through Washington as well.

"I hope that this will lead to an improvement in inter-Korean relations -- not only inter-Korean relations, but we also believe that there has been slowly, but gradually, a growing consensus on the need for dialogue between the United States and North Korea," Moon told reporters on February 17.

"We hope that the dialogue between the two Koreas will be able to lead to dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and eventually denuclearization."

Vice President Mike Pence sits between second lady Karen Pence and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the opening ceremony. Behind Pence are Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of North Korean Parliament, and Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Ever mindful of the US alliance, Moon has continued to include Washington in his comments regarding progress with North Korea, sustaining a view held by US President Donald Trump that North Korea has reached out because of the US' firm stance on sanctions.

On Friday the US showed little sign of lessening pressure on Pyongyang, imposing new sanctions against 27 entities and 28 vessels either registered or flagged in several countries, including North Korea, China and Singapore.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US is "aggressively targeting all illicit avenues used by North Korea to evade sanctions, including taking decisive action to block vessels, shipping companies, and entities across the globe that work on North Korea's behalf." He said the move was aimed at shutting down North Korea's illicit maritime smuggling activities.

"The latest US sanctions, which envisage potentially boarding North Korean surface vessels with force, were accompanied by a thinly-veiled reference by Trump to using military strikes if sanctions don't work," said Andrew O'Neil. "This is nothing new in US policy, but it does serve as a major reality check in the afterglow of the Winter Olympics and hopes that Inter-Korean relations may be entering a new phase."

The bond between the US and South Korea is what analysts like O'Neil believe North Korea is trying to fracture. "I also think it's probably a way for the North Koreans to push out further the prospect of military action from the US, because as long as the North is seen to be engaging with the South, they're not testing missiles," he pointed out.

It also gives the North an opportunity to continue to seek funds from the South, and any other accommodations it can get while wrestling with sanctions and maintaining its refusal to de-nuclearize, he added.

"The South Koreans aren't fools either," said O'Neil. "They've been down this path many times before."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) North Korean officials did not show up to a planned meeting with US officials at the demilitarized zone Thursday, where they were expected to continue discussions on repatriating the remains of Americans killed during the Korean War, a senior US official tells CNN.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Thursday that the North Koreans postponed the meeting the day it was supposed to take place.

Citing a senior North Korean official, Nauert said, "Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol ‎agreed in his dialogue with Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo to have his team meet with an American team on or about July the 12th to move forward with the repatriation of American service members' remains. Mid-day, on July the 12th, they contacted us and offered to meet on Sunday July the 15th," Nauert said in a statement. "We'll be ready."

Pompeo ignored a question about the apparent snub when asked by reporters traveling with him in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday.

The development is likely to fuel growing skepticism over North Korea's commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as promised during last month's meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore.

__label__world (CNN) If you've been watching the political shenanigans in Australia's capital with growing incredulity, spare a thought for the Australian voter: the person Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Thursday should be at the center of every politician's focus, and not an afterthought.

If you haven't been watching, a quick recap: a right wing faction within Turnbull's Liberal Party, which governs the country as part of a coalition government with the National Party, tried to seize power earlier this week.

The leadership contest, known as a "spill," came after Turnbull backtracked on an energy bill he wanted to push through parliament but didn't because it would have failed to garner enough support even from within his own party's ranks.

Turnbull who won the initial leadership contest 48 votes to 35, told the media of his satisfaction over the outcome, and averred that the government would carry on with its primary job, governing.

That was Tuesday.

By Wednesday night, all pretense of solidarity his challengers -- chief among them now former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton -- had shown with Turnbull in the preceding hours was abandoned.

Thursday, the contest was back on.

Parliament shut down five hours early as Liberal politicians huddled to count votes and collect numbers. Turnbull emerged later to tell reporters that he'll hold a party vote on Friday if his opponents presented a letter with enough signatures to support his ousting.

"The public hate what is going on at the moment. They want everyone here to be focused on them," Turnbull said later. "I have done everything I can to keep the Liberal Party and indeed the Coalition united."

But as he ponders what are likely his final hours as Australia's latest prime minister, he couldn't resist throwing a grenade or two at his party colleagues before shutting the door firmly behind him.

'Classic, back-to-the-wall' Malcolm

If Turnbull is going to end his almost three years as Australia's premier on Friday, he's made it clear he won't make it easy for Dutton and those who back the Queensland conservative.

For starters, there's the possibility that Dutton, an immigration hardliner, might be in breach of the constitution over his financial interests in childcare centers that received millions of dollars in government subsidies.

The country's solicitor-general was investigating and will provide advice on Friday that could determine whether Dutton, tipped to be the country's new leader by the end of the week, is even eligible to keep his seat in parliament because of the conflict of interest.

"I cannot underline too much how important it is that anyone who seeks to be Prime Minister of Australia is eligible to be a member of Parliament because a minister, let alone a Prime Minister, who is not eligible to sit in the House is not capable of validly being a minister or exercising any of the powers of a minister," Turnbull said Thursday.

"This is classic, back-to-the-wall Malcolm Turnbull. Looking for legal loopholes, looking for delaying tactics, and never giving in," wrote Annabel Crabb , a political writer for Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Additionally, he has dangled the prospect that the ruling coalition, which governs by a single seat majority in the lower house of parliament, would lose that tiny advantage should the no-confidence vote move ahead on Friday.

"If the motion is carried, I will treat that as a vote of no confidence and I will not stand as a candidate in the ballot," Turnbull said.

"I made it very clear that I believe former prime ministers are best out of the parliament and I don't think there's much evidence to suggest that that conclusion is correct. It's not correct."

That remark was a subtle jab at the man he ousted from the leadership in 2015. Tony Abbott remained in parliament after that putsch, and has been one of the main protagonists in the bid to oust Turnbull.

Crisis of their own making

The greatest irony for the federal politicians, who critics argue base policy decisions on popularity polls, is that should Dutton assume the premiership on Friday, he's not likely to keep the job beyond the next election.

The current opposition leader is the Labor Party's Bill Shorten. Shorten got 27% in that latest poll.

There's even the possibility that Dutton may not be able to hold onto his own electoral seat . He holds the Queensland state seat of Dickson by a mere 1.6%.

"The conservatives within the Liberal party have put their unpopularity down to their lack of a conservative identity, while liberals within the same party consider the conservatives as unelectable," said Rodger Shanahan, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute.

"This appeared at first blush as a conservative move to re-establish the Liberal Party's conservative credentials," he told CNN. "But the longer it goes on, there's a feeling that this is less about ideology and more about more prosaic issues like revenge and personal ambition."

Australia's former home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, faces the media at a press conference in Canberra on August 21, 2018.

Ugly questions around race

Former prime minister Julia Gillard, who took part in her own share of leadership contests when she was in parliament, told an audience in Melbourne Thursday that she feared the country was headed into an election "that would be quite ugly around questions of race."

"There's been no secret that there will be campaigning on law and order questions, putting to the forefront people's race and ethnicity rather than the crime," she said.

Dutton's unpopularity stems in large part from his hardline stance on immigration tests and social issues, including his opposition to same-sex marriage before its legalization in 2017. He also boycotted the national apology to the generations of Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their parents and families and made to assimilate into white Australian culture.

But he has been bolstered by conservatives in the national dialogue, both in politics and in the media , something Turnbull also spoke to during his remarks on Thursday.

"You have got to judge the political actions by their outcomes. I think what we're witnessing -- what we have witnessed at the moment is a very deliberate effort to pull the Liberal Party further to the right." Turnbull said.

"What began as a minority has by a process of intimidation, you know, persuaded people that the only way to stop the insurgency is to give in to it. I do not believe in that. I have never done that. I have never given in to bullies, but you can imagine the pressure it's put people under."
__label__politics (CNN) A senator is asking the Treasury Department to turn over records of a lucrative real estate sale Donald Trump made to a Russian billionaire as the Senate Finance Committee looks into Trump's ties to Russians.

Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee's ranking member, on Friday requested the financial records of the sale of Trump's former estate in Palm Beach to Dmitry Rybolovlev.

Wyden's letter outlined how Donald Trump bought a 6.3-acre property in Florida for $41.35 million in 2004 and then sold that property to a company owned by the businessman four years later. The sale price to Rybolovlev more than doubled Trump's initial investment, to $95 million. The property's appraisal in 2008 fell short of that sale price by $30 million, Wyden said.

"In the context of the President's then-precarious financial position, I believe that the Palm Beach property sale warrants further scrutiny," the Oregon Democrat wrote. "It is imperative that Congress follow the money and conduct a thorough investigation into any potential money laundering or other illicit financial dealings between the President, his associates, and Russia."

As ranking member, Wyden has the right to ask for these documents, and some of his past efforts to receive Trump-related records from Treasury have produced results. Still, Wyden's letter doesn't carry the weight of a bipartisan request or one from the majority. Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown little interest in investigating Trump's finances.

__label__politics (CNN) French President Emmanuel Macron said he believes US President Donald Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal next month "for domestic reasons," describing the US as "insane" for its constant global policy U-turns, according to reports.

Macron's remarks appeared to be a concession that he may have failed to convince Trump to stay party to the agreement during his three-day visit to Washington.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to ditch the landmark deal, which obliges Iran to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the suspension of economic sanctions.

Trump has long criticized the agreement as being too soft on Iran, but has signed several waivers to continue the suspension of the sanctions during his time in office, keeping the deal alive. He has said more recently that he will refuse to sign the next round of waivers on May 12 unless the agreement is amended to take a tougher stance.

"My view -- I don't know what your President will decide -- is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons," Macron told US reporters in Washington on Wednesday, according to the Guardian.

He said he did not have any specific inside information, but believed there was "a big risk" Trump would leave, according to CBS.

In reference to Trump having pulled the US from the Paris climate change agreement as well, Macron said changes in the US stance on several world issues might work in the short term but were "very insane in the medium to long term," the Guardian reported.

Trump used the same term to describe the Iran deal on Tuesday, speaking alongside Macron at a joint press conference.

"It's insane, it's ridiculous, it should haven ever been made. But we'll be talking about it," Trump said. "It was a terrible deal."

A US withdrawal would deal a blow to the other nations that helped broker it. Many had placed their hopes on the French leader to temper his American counterpart. Iran has also said it will not accept any alternative deal and threatened to resume nuclear activity should the current agreement be scrapped.

A bigger, better deal?

French President Emmanuel Macron, left, with US Presdient Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

Macron has positioned himself as a negotiator between Europe and the US, and appears to have established an influential relationship with President Trump. His visit to the US this week has been a charm offensive peppered with handshakes and kisses between the two leaders to pronounce their warm relations.

But in an address to the US Congress on Wednesday, Macron appealed to the country's leaders to preserve the Iran deal and remain part of the global community, taking a clear jab at Trump's "America First" agenda.

He reaffirmed France's commitment to the Iran accord, reminding Congress that both his country and the United States had signed it. "That is why we cannot say we should get rid of it like that," he said.

Trump has criticized the current agreement for failing to address Iran's ballistic missile program or its role in the Syrian conflict. European leaders have sought to address those issues separately.

Macron earlier this week said there was no plan B for the Iran agreement, but on Tuesday he indicated there may be room for a new deal to curb Iran's regional ambitions and ballistic missiles program that would run alongside the existing nuclear pact.

Trump said he would pull the US out of the deal during his election campaign, but in January he ramped up pressure on his European allies to "fix the terrible flaws" of the deal by May 12 or he would withdraw.

"My commitment, my action is not to try to convince President Trump to walk away from his campaign's commitments or to change his mind. I'm not a masochist," Macron said Wednesday at a press conference in Washington. "I believe that what we should be doing is to try to find an efficient way to build this genuine multilateralism."

Macron swipes at Trumpism

In his speech to Congress, Macron pushed the US to consider rejoining the Paris climate change agreement, which Trump announced his country would leave last year.

He gave an impassioned speech in which he reminded Congress that the US "invented this multilateralism" and now needed to help preserve it.

"We can choose isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism. This is an option. It can be tempting to us as a temporary remedy to our fears," Macron said.

"But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse, but inflame the fears of our citizens."

He also warned against the growing strongman-style of leadership seen in several parts of the world.

"Personally, if you ask me, I do not share the fascination for new strong powers, the abandonment of freedom and the illusion of nationalism."
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that the European Union is worse than China on trade during a conversation that portended the tense end to this year's G7 summit.

In a meeting at the White House during the French president's visit to Washington in April, Macron suggested the United States and France should work together to resolve shared trade problems with Beijing, prompting Trump to make his remark, a person in the room told CNN.

Trump told Macron during their meeting in Washington that there are too many German cars in the United States, the source previously told CNN. The source did not say Trump explicitly said he wanted all German-made cars out of the US. Trump focused his conversation with Macron on German trade for about 15 minutes in the one-hour meeting.

Trump has been on a tear about German trade and cars in particular, bringing up the issues with other European leaders with whom he has met over the last few months, the source said.
__label__politics Greenbelt, Maryland (CNN) President Donald Trump should not be barred from renting rooms to foreign governments, even those that say publicly say they are doing so to curry the President's favor, a Trump administration attorney argued Monday.

Arguing the emoluments clause of the Constitution is "not a comprehensive conflict of interest" rule, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate told a federal court the President must actually take action favorable to the foreign government -- a quid pro quo, or exchange -- to run afoul of the law.

Trump is not responsible for a foreign official's "unilateral attempt to sow favor," Shumate said.

At one point, federal district judge Peter Messitte asked: "How is that different from bribery?"

Bribery, Shumate said, would require the President to have "some corrupt intent."

__label__politics Michael D'Antonio is the author of " Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success " (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) During an hourlong performance Tuesday at a table crowded with lawmakers -- let's call it The President Show -- Donald Trump appeared determined to prove two things. The first was obvious: After much speculation about his temperament, inspired by the dark portrait painted in the book "Fire and Fury," he no doubt wanted to show himself to be an executive in command of the issues and fit to govern. The second was that he is a good man with a warm heart.

In Trump's eyes, the meeting was a huge success. On Wednesday, he said at his first Cabinet meeting of 2018, that the session a day earlier was a "tremendous meeting" and that it got "great reviews."

In truth, in the role of executive, Trump should get three out of five stars because he spoke calmly and didn't insult anyone.

However he showed little understanding of the immigration issues he was supposed to discuss and seemed to abandon his own bargaining position. He even embraced the role of a figurehead who would do whatever Congress dictates as he promised that, if "this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it."

Trump's turn in the role as good-hearted man was marked by lines like, "Truly, it should be a bill of love, and we can do that." He was referring to devising a plan that would protect from deportation 800,000 young immigrants who live under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

What he didn't say was that he personally set in motion the cruel policy that would begin their deportation in March, and that he campaigned for president by repeating anti-immigrant slurs that tapped into prejudice with dangerous results -- as in the case of two brothers who attacked a Latino man in Boston, with one of them later telling police, "Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported."

The word "love", as voiced by Donald Trump, has a strange tone. It's like listening to a first-day student repeat after the instructor in a foreign language class. You recognize the words, but not the feeling behind them.

He sounded similarly off-key last autumn when he talked about how he "loved" Puerto Rico when he visited after Hurricane Maria. In fact he met few actual victims of the storm and his administration's response to the island's needs lacked the energy (read "love") shown for the people of Texas and Florida in similar circumstances.

Similarly, a President who has said he loves "all the people of our country" has proven to be a most divisive figure, picking winners and losers in everything from tax policy (sorry residents of Democratic-leaning "Blue" states) to civil rights issues. He loudly imagined talking about a generic protesting athlete as a "son of a bitch."And, quite bizarrely, Trump followed up his many acid remarks about US intelligence agencies by telling people at the Central Intelligence Agency , "I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you."

Altogether, Trump's attempt at self-revealing comments, whether he's voicing the love in his heart for some people, or his hatred for others, like protesters and members of the press, depict a man whose emotional declarations seem manipulative, staged, and hollow.

His most authentic expressions of feeling seem to come when he's angry or mocking. In those moments, it's easy to hear that he means what he says. However when he tries to show warmth, he is far less convincing and his motivations are transparent.

When he visited the CIA at the start of his presidency Trump was trying to repair the damage done as he denigrated intelligence agencies and faced the prospect of trying to carry out policy with a bureaucracy he had savaged. His expressions of concern for the DACA "dreamers" comes as much of America worries about the fate of these young people and their deportation looms as a remarkable act of heartlessness.

Besides a general desire to be seen as more humane, Trump hinted Tuesday at another reason why he would want to appear warmer and more congenial. This he revealed when asked about the potential presidential candidacy of media-mogul Oprah Winfrey, who sparked talk of a run with a speech at the Golden Globes awards ceremony. In that speech, Winfrey hit many of the themes Barack Obama struck when he burst on the national scene in 2004 and she inspired a viral #Oprah2020 online movement.

Trump came alive when asked about Oprah's potential, saying, "I know her very well. You know I did one of her last shows. She had Donald Trump -- this is before politics -- her last week. And she had Donald Trump and my family. It was very nice. No, I like Oprah. I don't think she's going to run. I don't think she's going to run. I know her very well."

What Trump knows about Oprah is that after decades of a five-days-a-week national talk show and dozens of movie and TV roles that resonated with feeling, Oprah, one of the most famous women in the world, is known for her authenticity and warmth. No one has revealed his or her heart to greater effect and, along the way, she has made emotional honesty possible for public figures.

Recall Oprah talking about her trouble in childhood, her struggles in love, or even her effort to manage her weight and you are recalling the deeds of a woman who taught America how to speak from the heart. In the process, she demonstrated that her own heart is full, strong, and open in ways that Trump cannot match. The President surely understands the power of Oprah's emotional authenticity and it was this understanding that prompted his own effort to show warmth toward the DACA dreamers.

The trouble for Trump is that he has spent a lifetime showing the world that love and compassion are not his strengths. Whether he was trying to evict people from an apartment building he bought in New York or encouraging people to rough up protesters at his rally, Trump has shown that his true emotional nature is cold, not warm, cramped, not expansive.

With Oprah and her abundant love looming on the political horizon, Trump seems to have intuited that he needs to show a little kindness himself. If he wants the audience, or rather, the country, to buy his performance, he'll need to cultivate some of the real thing.

__label__politics Tucson, Arizona (CNN) Arizona now has a historic all-female Senate race -- and it is already getting nasty. Images of a pink tutu against a US Air Force flight suit are one candidate's opening salvo in what could be one of the most expensive and highest-profile races this November.

Either Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema or Republican Rep. Martha McSally will become the first female US senator from Arizona in what could be a critical result for which party controls the Senate. Early signs are that the all-woman race will be anything but dainty.

McSally started the fight early, even before she won Tuesday's primary against right-wing challengers , with her first ad against Sinema, who also won her party nomination this week.

America's first woman to fly in combat for the Air Force, McSally deployed to the Middle East after the 9/11 attacks. The ad shows side-by-side pictures -- McSally in her flight suit underneath a fighter jet versus Sinema in a pink tutu, protesting the Iraq War with bongo drums and a protester in a tie-dye T-shirt behind her.

The images could not be more different.

Rep. Martha McSally's ad uses pictures of her and her opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, left, in very different situations.

"She's in a pink tutu. I'm in my uniform," McSally said in an interview with CNN, explaining why she chose to open her general election campaign with this ad. Wearing a gold necklace with a fighter jet emblem, McSally underscored her groundbreaking role as a woman in the military and her lawsuit against the Pentagon that eliminated the regulation for military women to cover their heads and arms while in Saudi Arabia.

"I served in the military 26 years and put my life on the line for our freedoms. I've fought for women's rights. She's out there protesting in a pink tutu, while we were in harm's way."

From poverty to politics

McSally's hard-charging fighter pilot personality is reflected in her personal fitness, too. The 52-year-old has competed in triathlons and is often on the jogging trail before her campaign team has even woken up and cracked open their phones.

And in this, her opponent may match her stride for stride. Sinema, 42, was the first serving member of Congress to compete in an Ironman triathlon. She cheekily tweeted a link this week about extreme athleticism as the new midlife crisis.

If McSally's barrier-breaking military service resonates powerfully in the state, so does Sinema's cinematic story of a childhood in extreme poverty.

Sinema and her two siblings moved with their mother from Arizona to Florida, where they faced homelessness and poverty.

Sinema was born in to a middle-class Tucson family, whose financial woes escalated during the 1980s. Her parents divorced, and her mother remarried and moved Sinema and two siblings to Florida with their new stepfather. The financial troubles would deteriorate further in Florida, Sinema recalled.

"Being homeless for three years is not easy," she said, reflecting on how her family moved into an abandoned gas station. "Living without running water, without electricity, sometimes being hungry, it teaches you to value every opportunity that comes your way."

The poverty gave Sinema her own youthful purpose to push hard. She graduated from Brigham Young University early and returned to Phoenix to do social work in low-income communities. She then earned master's, law and doctorate degrees from Arizona State University and became a criminal defense attorney before running for the state Legislature with the Green Party. She came out publicly as a bisexual and led a campaign to defeat a same-sex marriage ban. Sinema joined the Democratic Party and ran for the US House, winning as the only openly bisexual member in Congress

Trying the high road

But if her background on paper sounds like that of a forceful liberal, Sinema paints herself in ads and in person as an upbeat, unifying moderate. Sinema points out her congressional voting record of about 60% in line with President Donald Trump, touting a moderate record with an ever-diversifying Arizona. Shifting demographics in the state have pushed the politics more purple and Trump won Arizona in 2016 by less than 4 percentage points

"I'm not an ideological person," said Sinema, cheerful as she spoke with CNN in an interview. "I'm very practical, common sense. Very focused on getting the job done. I think that's spoken to a lot people in Arizona who are the same way. We share those same values."

Democratic operatives in Arizona say McSally's ad certainly stings, but Sinema's campaign plans to forge ahead by taking the high road. She easily won her primary, and Democratic state sources say her general election plan will be to point out McSally's embrace of Trump and her shift to the right in the GOP primary.

Sinema, a Democrat, says she is a moderate in line with what she believes to be the thinking of most Arizonans.

At a polling place on primary day, Sinema greeted voters, reacting with disciplined calm when asked repeatedly about the attacks from McSally. "Our campaign is 100% focused on the work that we're doing to listen to Arizonans and respond to their everyday concerns," she told CNN.

"As I travel the state, I hear from everyday Arizonans what they care most about. And they don't really care about whether someone has an R or a D at the end of their name. What they care about is who's going to roll up their sleeves and just solve their problems."

Woman vs. woman

Still, McSally's video challenge to Sinema is an eye-catching gambit.

remarked Kelly Dittmar, a Rutgers University assistant professor with the "That ad -- wow,"remarked Kelly Dittmar, a Rutgers University assistant professor with the Center for American Women and Politics . The center has been tracking the record-breaking number of women running for office this year but notably watching Arizona with its high-profile race between McSally and Sinema.

"McSally's ad reinforces what have typically been credentials for candidacy most associated with men," Dittmar said. "Importantly, she doesn't downplay the fact that she is a woman but does contrast with Sinema the type of woman she is, contrasting the performance of gender between the two women. One (is) more associated with stereotypically masculine roles and strengths, and the other associated with traditional conceptions of femininity and, more specifically, weakness and/or a lack of seriousness to deal with the serious national security issues she raises in the ad."

Republican McSally highlights her former military service as she campaigns across Arizona.

In a year where women have prized their authenticity, from their gender and race professions to even personal tattoos , Arizona's single gender US Senate race promises to alter the national narrative on gender in politics.

"Women candidates who offer different types of experience, perspectives and images of leadership will help to expand all of our notions of who can and should serve in government," Dittmar said. "An all-female race makes it even harder for voters and observers to ignore this diversity among women."

More ads will certainly roll out in the coming weeks as money floods into a race that national Republicans see as critical to maintaining their control of the Senate and that national Democrats see as a potential gain.

DefendArizona, a political action committee formed by some of the state's most powerful business leaders, has already reserved nearly $5 million in TV airspace this fall, said spokesman Barrett Marson. "And that's an initial reserve," added Marson, saying the PAC had already spent more than $3 million to prop up McSally.

Sinema has plenty in the bank to counter McSally's attacks. Between January and August, her campaign had raised more than $10 million, with $2.4 million cash on hand. McSally also raised $7.7 million, with $1.9 million on hand in the same period.

A hope that perspective outranks gender

Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is one of those who faced another woman in her Senate run in 2014. Democrat Natalie Tennant opened her campaign for Senate with an attack ad against Capito, then a member of the House. The ad accused the lawmaker of being part of an obstructionist and gridlocked Congress, prompting Capito to call the opening ad "vindictive."

The seven-term congresswoman would eventually defeat Tennant soundly, making history in West Virginia as that state's first woman in the Senate. She was also the first Republican senator elected by West Virginia in almost 60 years.

Shelley Moore Capito broke a glass ceiling when she defeated another woman to become the first female US senator from West Virginia.

"Yes, of course, there is a difference between running against a man and running against a woman," Capito told CNN. "But I think it has more to do with the different perspectives we have when it comes to the issues."

Capito welcomes matchups such as the McSally-Sinema race, looking forward to the day when it's no longer notable that so many women are candidates.

"It's a positive change in the makeup of our political landscape. I was the first woman elected to the Senate from the state of West Virginia," she said. "I'm incredibly proud of that, and I want that accomplishment to be inspiration and motivation for other young women in West Virginia -- as well as women across the country. We need even more women running for office -- at all levels."
__label__world (CNN) It was like a first date that had gone exceptionally well. Hungarian leader Viktor Orban and Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini spoke of a shared passion, exchanged compliments and promised to see each other again.

After their rendezvous on Tuesday in Milan, the staunchly anti-migrant Orban described Salvini as his hero for refusing to allow rescued asylum-seekers, stuck on a boat, to set foot on Italian soil unless the European Union settled them elsewhere.

Salvini said he hoped Tuesday was just the first of many more encounters with Orban to change Europe's destiny.

The burgeoning relationship between the two far-right figures may look like just another political bromance, but it could turn out to be a Trojan horse for EU leaders, once worried that Brexit would tear their post-war union apart.

Hardline Brexit supporters in the UK accuse EU leaders of trying to ensure Britain's withdrawal from the union is a failure so that other member states don't follow the country out the door, a charge that EU leaders vehemently deny.

In the meantime, far-right factions across the EU are eying big wins in the European Parliament elections next May, an opportunity that comes only once in five years and promises huge regional influence over policies, most crucially on migration.

As talks of a French "Frexit" or a "Nexit" in the Netherlands and other nations fade from public discourse, the EU is more likely at threat from those who want to bend the bloc from within.

Jerome Rivière from France's far-right National Rally, formerly known as National Front, was optimistic the election results would favor euroskeptic parties.

"I believe that for the first time we might be in a position to have a new majority in the next European election," he said.

"If we do not have a majority, I believe we will have a minority strong enough to prevent them from what they are doing right now."

A perfect storm

What these parties have lacked for so long has been unity to coordinate action in the European Parliament. The Orban-Salvini relationship shows that an appetite for such unity is growing. In the past, anti-establishment populist parties that have had beef with the EU have also been at loggerheads with each other.

Hungary and Italy, for example, clashed over migrant policy several times in 2016. Italy, a frontline nation for asylum-seekers, has long pressed Hungary to take in a share of refugees to lessen its burden. But Hungary has advocated a hardline zero-immigration policy since the mass movement of asylum seekers into Europe in 2015, at the height of the Syrian war. Most other EU nations have accepted asylum-seekers under the union's relocation program, but Hungary has refused to, along with several other eastern European states.

Bilateral cooperation between like-minded parties, voter apathy and the European Parliament's electoral system could be the perfect storm that hands Europe's levers over to populists.

Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens, but turnout at each vote has fallen consistently over the years -- just over 42% of registered voters cast a ballot in the last election in 2014, according to the Public Opinion Monitoring Unit.

"The euroskeptic parties do better in European elections than they usually do in national elections, that's because the voters on the one hand believe that the European elections are somewhat less important than the national elections," Doru Frantescu, an EU affairs expert, told CNN.

Euroskeptic parties also tend to take European elections more seriously for the obvious reason that one of their main objectives is to challenge the EU.

The European Parliament's system also benefits fringe parties. Instead of winning seats on a first-past-the-post basis, candidates need simply to pass a low threshold of the popular vote. This has meant that parties like France's National Rally have a far greater presence in the European Parliament than they do in their own national assemblies.

This representation in the European Parliament is already in play.

MEP John Stuart Agnew from the far-right UKIP party in Britain argued in a European Parliament opinion report that human-induced climate change was "negligible" and pointed to cosmic ray fluctuations, the sun, oceans and water vapor as "factors that really do change our climate." This kind of denial of climate change science was unheard of in the European Parliament just a few years ago.

Frantescu said it's unlikely skeptical far-right parties can gain control of parliament, but that doesn't mean their influence won't grow. With the European Parliament already fractured, even a small increase in seats could make a significant difference.

"You don't need to gain a majority in the European Parliament to exert influence on the EU policies and the (European) Commission, you just need to have a somewhat solid minority," Frantescu said.

A strong minority could be effective in blocking policy, he said, and a small boost in influence in parliament could be the start of greater change in the longer-term.

"The European elections are not the end of the movie, or the end of the world, rather it's the beginning," he said.

"The question is will they be able to coordinate afterwards. Will they be able to get maybe good results in the national elections in the member states? ... Will they get their hands on other national governments so that they can exert pressure in the council of the EU, which is the other key legislative body of the European Union?"

The Bannon effect

Some of the parties looking to shake things up in Brussels are counting on Steve Bannon, US President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, to help buoy their electoral results.

Bannon has been on several European tours to galvanize like-minded political outfits and even helped launch The Movement, a "supergroup" uniting populists to challenge the European establishment.

"Everybody agrees that next May is hugely important, that this is the real first continent-wide face-off between populism and the party of Davos," Bannon said in an interview with the Daily Beast in July , referring to Davos, Switzerland, as symbol of the world's liberal elite. "This will be an enormously important moment for Europe."

Steve Bannon, left, with France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen after giving a speech at her party's annual congress on March 10, 2018 in Lille, France.

Movement founder Mischaël Modrikamen, leader of the Belgian People's Party, said Bannon was offering resources to help the new alliance at the elections.

"He will bring tools that were in use in the States. They won the election against all odds. He will bring tools of course. Europeans are already using them," he told CNN, adding that big data was one area European parties could benefit from.

"We are in a big fight for the soul of what I believe should be Western civilization."

Salvini has floated a similar idea to Bannon's supergroup, calling for a European "League of Leagues" to unite populists. Salvini's spokesman told CNN that the minister had met with Bannon to exchange ideas, at Bannon's request.

But pro-EU MEPs say they are not threatened by Bannon. Elmar Brok, a German MEP, said he was confident pro-EU members would prevail in the elections and that Bannon's efforts to intervene in European affairs would likely backfire.

He accused Bannon of using Europe's far-right figures to destroy Europe and pivot power to other nations.

"In this sense, Mr. Bannon is very helpful to us because we can easily explain to our people that the purpose of all that is to weaken European nations in such a way that they do not have to play any role in this world, and that this becomes a world of Washington, Beijing and Moscow," he said.

Analysts also question how influential Bannon can be. The unity he and Modrikamen are seeking will not be easily achieved.

"A profound problem is that this is the fragmented European landscape. Many of these right-wing parties, or right-wing populist parties, they may all have problems with the EU, but many of them have problems with each other," said Alexander Clarkson, a European and international studies lecturer at King's College London.

"So for Bannon to come in and try to create unity out of all these very powerful, very well-financed movements that don't necessarily like each other, I think that says more about an American, not just Bannon, but an American media's version of European politics and Bannon's vision of European politics."

(CNN) Since the Second World War -- spanning 14 US presidents, Republican and Democratic -- the occupant of the Oval Office has been referred to as "the leader of the free world." Until now.

Over his 18 months in office, Trump has surrendered that mantle without a mandate to do so. Trump's impulse is to echo Russian President Vladimir Putin's talking points and advance his agenda, even as elements of his administration attempt to push back to protect longstanding American interests.

Time and again the world has witnessed what journalist Luke Harding describes in his book "Collusion" as Trump's "weirdly deferential behavior toward Putin -- his singular reluctance to criticize, his boundless willingness to appease, his desire for face time."

JUST WATCHED Anderson Cooper: Trump performance disgraceful Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Anderson Cooper: Trump performance disgraceful 02:00

This past week offered new lows in this shameful dance on the world stage, capped by what Anderson Cooper diagnosed as a "disgraceful" performance at Helsinki, in which Trump was more critical of Democrats and his own Justice Department than of Putin or Russia.

In the days before his largely unsupervised chat with Putin in Helsinki, Trump attacked our NATO allies at a Belgian summit, suggesting the US could "go our own way." He nonsensically blamed President Barack Obama for Russia's invasion of Crimea, insulted German Chancellor Angela Merkel, undercut embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit and described the European Union as a "foe" of the United States.

__label__world (CNN) Here is a look at Sunni extremist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) .

The Yemeni-based arm of al Qaeda, AQAP, emerged when al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and Yemen unified in 2009.

Many analysts believe AQAP is the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate

AQAP's main goals include establishing a caliphate in the Arabian Peninsula, implementing Sharia law and targeting local, US and Western interests in the Arabian Peninsula and worldwide. AQAP has targeted multiple embassies, as well as foreign tourists, using car bombs and suicide bombs.

Anwar al-Awlaki served as the spokesman for AQAP until his death in 2011.

Al-Wuhayshi was succeeded by AQAP's military commander, Qassim al-Rimi.

AQAP is funded through robberies and kidnappings, as well as through donations from supporters.

In an effort to rebrand, AQAP has sometimes gone by the alias Ansar al-Sharia (AAS), which means "supporters of Islamic law." However, numerous groups have taken on the name Ansar al-Sharia, and not all are associated with AQAP

__label__politics (CNN) A federal judge in Boston said Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement shouldn't remove people who are in the process of applying for green cards just because they have final orders of removal.

US District Judge Mark Wolf issued the ruling during a hearing in the case of New England couples -- US citizens who are married to undocumented immigrants -- who say they're being caught in a "trap" by the government to arrest immigrants. The couples argue that the "provisional waiver process," which allows undocumented immigrants to try to obtain citizenship, is being used incorrectly.

Wolf also denied the government's motion to dismiss the case.

"ICE may only remove them from the US after considering the fact that they were pursuing provisional waivers," Wolf said in court Thursday. "I am not precluding ICE from taking action."

Wolf's statement was not a preliminary injunction, which would have been a court order for ICE to stop deporting undocumented immigrants who were going through the waiver process.

It is unclear if the government would face a penalty if it doesn't abide by the ruling, and if this would apply outside the New England area.

Five New England couples are suing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, ICE officials, President Donald Trump and Boston-area law enforcement officials after they said multiple spouses with final orders of removal were detained by ICE after sitting down for marriage interviews with their US-citizen spouses at a Boston-area US Citizenship and Immigration Services office. Such interviews are part of the application process to prove their marriages to US citizens are legitimate, enabling them to move toward legal status.

Emails entered as evidence in the case show what appear to be efforts between Citizenship and Immigration Services employees and ICE employees to coordinate the interview appointments and arrests of people appearing for interviews with final orders of deportation. USCIS said that, in general, when its officers encounter someone with outstanding warrants or removal orders, they will notify the appropriate law enforcement agency. DHS did not comment further.

American Civil Liberties Union attorney Matt Segal, who along with attorneys from the firm WilmerHale is representing the five couples named in this suit, said his interpretation of Thursday's ruling is that while it wasn't styled as a court order, "it is a ruling on the law, and our expectation -- and presumably the court's -- is that the government is going to comply with the law as it's now been interpreted by the court."

"So as of the ruling today the law from the court's perspective is that people cannot be targeted for arrest and removal unless there is consideration given to the fact that they're pursuing this provisional waiver process," Segal said Thursday.

CNN asked the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, if it plans on complying with the ruling and a spokeswoman replied: "As a matter of policy, we don't comment on pending litigation."

Court filings from the ACLU show that about 13 people have been arrested at marriage interviews in the Boston area since January. The ACLU says it is asking other New England residents to contact them if they are not citizens and believe they are being targeted for ICE arrest or removal, despite being in the process of applying to become lawful permanent residents.

The situations the couples face came to light after a Rhode Island woman, Lilian Calderon, 30, was taken into ICE custody in January when she and her husband went to a nearby USCIS office for a marriage interview so she could begin trying to become a lawful permanent resident.

Calderon is a Guatemalan immigrant who was brought to the US when she was 3 years old. She is married to a US citizen, Luis Gordillo, and the couple has two children. She alleges in the case that after her interview was complete, she was "unexpectedly detained by ICE."

Calderon had been subject to a final order of removal since the age of 15, after her father's asylum application was denied. Her Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals application was also denied in 2017 because, according to the complaint, "she had not provided sufficient evidence of her continuous presence in the United States."

Calderon was held in an ICE detention facility in Boston from January until Feb. 13, after Wolf issued an order prohibiting ICE from deporting her while her lawsuit is pending.

ICE officials testified that they believe the arrest in Calderon's case was justified, per Trump's January 2017 executive order calling for "the faithful execution of immigration laws of the United States ... against all removable aliens."

After Wolf's ruling Thursday, Calderon said, through a spokeswoman, that she and her husband were "delighted" the judge has allowed the case to proceed.

"Luis and I were trying to do what the government asked of us so that our family could continue to be together," Calderon said in the statement to CNN. "This gives us hope that no other family will have to endure what we have."

Both parties are expected to file written status reports on the case to Wolf by Sept. 12.

Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don't let that happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2018

The President's warning comes just days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a similar warning to Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, saying an attack on Idlib was something that Syria and Russia "agreed not to permit," and that the US "sees this as an escalation of an already dangerous conflict."

Sergey Lavrov is defending Syrian and Russian assault on #Idlib. The Russians and Assad agreed not to permit this. The U.S sees this as an escalation of an already dangerous conflict. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) August 31, 2018

Trump and Pompeo's warnings come as US officials grow worried that an assault on Idlib could involve the use of chemical weapons if the rebels are able to slow regime advances.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has moved armed helicopters closer to Idlib in recent weeks, according to two defense officials. The US is concerned they could eventually be used to launch another chemical attack as well as a conventional assault.

__label__politics (CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Gathering Crowds , by John Scott from the television show "This Week In Baseball ."

A new Quinnipiac University poll finds that President Donald Trump's approval rating is 41%, with a disapproval rating of 54%. That's largely consistent with live-interview national polling taken the last few months.

When you break it down by race, Trump's approval rating is 9% among black voters. His disapproval rating is 85% among them.

There is another poll out in which more than 30% of black voters supposedly approve of Trump's job performance. Trump's biggest fans have trumpeted this poll as a sign that he is breaking through with African-Americans. The problem is the poll is almost certainly incorrect.

Polls of higher quality such as Quinnipiac's -- probability-based polls that are transparent about their data -- have consistently found Trump's approval rating to be much lower. The President's approval rating in these polls completed since July has averaged 12% with African-Americans. His disapproval rating has averaged 84%.

Here's the thing though: It does actually seem that Trump has gained support among African-Americans since the 2016 election.

The network exit polls had Trump winning only 8% among black voters in 2016. Hillary Clinton took 89% of their vote. That is, Clinton won black voters by an 81-percentage-point margin.

Trump's average net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) with blacks right now is -72 points. In other words, he's shrunk his deficit by 9 points.

I would argue, though, that the President has made an even bigger improvement. To make an apples-to-apples comparison, we can look at a post-election Pew Research Center study with verified voters. Pew found that Clinton had an even larger margin 85-point margin with black voters, of 91% to 6%. If this study were correct, it would mean that Trump had doubled his black support since the election. (Note: Trump's approval rating with blacks in a Pew poll in June, not included in our average, was 14%. Again, this suggests he has gained since the election.)

of Trump's approval rating comes with a fairly wide margin of error. That's why I decided to look at the President's average approval rating since April in Even with averaging, the African-American subsample in these polls is small enough that our current estimateof Trump's approval rating comes with a fairly wide margin of error. That's why I decided to look at the President's average approval rating since April in Gallup's tracking poll . Doing so gives us a total sample of about 2,500 black respondents, a fairly robust sample size.

In this Gallup data since April, Trump's approval rating has averaged 13%. His disapproval rating has averaged 84%. Both of which are slightly better for Trump than our average since July.

What's interesting is that when you compare Trump's approval rating in Gallup polling with the percentage of the vote he got against Clinton in every other ethnic or racial group, Trump is doing worse now than he did back in 2016.

Is it possible that these high-quality pollsters are simply missing black respondents who dislike Trump? Sure. That, though, is a theory without any evidence that I know of.

Quinnipiac, Could it be that some African-Americans are saying they approve of the President but they won't end up voting Republican in an election? Of course. Additionally, many black voters undecided on Trump may go with the Democrats in the end. That said, there doesn't seem to be any sign of that in polling from Marist College Pew or the The Washington Post . The Democratic margin on the generic congressional ballot with black voters isn't any greater in these polls than Trump's net approval rating among them would imply.

It just seems that for whatever reason the President has picked up a small, but statistically significant, amount of support among African-Americans. The fact that he has done so while losing support among all other racial groups makes it that much more impressive.

It's not clear that this shift in sentiment will make much of a difference in 2018. Democrats still hold a sizable lead on the generic congressional ballot. A lead large enough that they should win control of the House, if everything holds through November.

Still, the importance of even a slight shift in African-American voter sentiment shouldn't be underestimated. They make up greater than 10% of the US electorate, and more in key swing states like Florida, Michigan and Virginia.

If you were to apply the changes we see in Trump's approval rating among blacks compared with his vote share in 2016 and all other groups voted the same, it would mean a shift in the national margin of about 1 percentage point toward him. In these swing states mentioned, it could be even greater.

One point may not seem like a lot, but remember that's half of Clinton's national margin in 2016. George W. Bush was able to win 2004 in part because he made a small gain among black voters similar to that Trump seems to have made since his own election.

If Trump is able to hold on to his additional African-American support, it could aid him in 2020.
__label__world (CNN) — The maneki-neko goes by many names.

The waving cat, the lucky cat, the beckoning cat.

There are even more variations in its meaning.

It's generally believed a lifted left paw invites success in business, while a raised right is for protection at home.

While many may associate the talisman with Chinese business establishments, their origins actually reside in Japan.

There's some debate as to which city holds the claim, but the most enduring legend is that of Gotokuji in Setagaya district, Tokyo , where the original feline inspiration for the figures has its own temple.

l e v a r t

The maneki-neko's origins

Nestled in the quiet neighborhood, you'll find the temple is swarming with the smiling ceramic kittens when you travel here.

According to local lore, when the temple was a mere hut in the 1400s, the monk who overlooked it struggled to live on his meager income. Despite this, he had a cat he loved so much he even shared his meals with it. One day he asked the cat to bring good fortune.

A short time later several samurai arrived during a rain storm, explaining the cat waved them in from the road. The monk served them tea and shared his teachings. The samurais were so delighted and one announced himself as Naotaka Li, lord of Hikone, Koshu prefecture.

Having his eyes opened by the monk's words, and considering it the will of Buddha, the lord donated rice fields and crop lands to the temple, making it the grand shrine it is today.

Years later, when the cat passed away it was enshrined as a god called Shobyo Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy, and a monument was established on the grounds for the animal.

Today visitors to Gotokuji leave the tailed talismans as a gesture of gratitude for wishes that have been fulfilled. The uniform maneki-nekos arrange to form a veritable kitty army, numbering into the thousands. Even more are available to purchase at the temple, ranging in sizes from just 3 centimeters to a foot tall to leave as an offering or take home as a good luck souvenir.

A veritable meow mix

While the feline figurines at Gotokuji Temple are uniform white, different colors denote different meanings. The traditional tri-color versions grant general prosperity, while white stands for purity, black for luck, red for protection from illness and pink for luck in love.

There are a wide variety of beliefs and specific variations when it comes to colors, such as some who think gold grants special fortune, while green is thought to aid in academics.

Mostly identical, a few Gotokuji figures stand out.

Some have dates going back years or messages written on them.

"Meow! Food!" reads one. Another sports a mini-sombrero while one wears a pearl necklace. Miniature versions occupy almost every available space, between shelves and even atop the heads of some of the larger statues.

Ruminating on what continues to drive maneki-neko enthusiasts to Gotokuji, Micha Robertson, the owner of the Lucky Cat Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio, explains that aside from the historical significance, "is the feeling that even though all of the cats on the grounds are essentially the same, each one represents a different person's hopes or desires."

Maneki-nekos traditionally wear a bib and bell, sometimes painted on, to represent the Gotokuji monk taking special care of his cat. They are also usually depicted holding coins, but being of a Samurai family's temple, Gotokuji maneki-nekos are empty-handed.

In the warrior society, while the opportunity for success is offered, it is up to the person making the wish to capture it.

__label__politics "My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will," Cohen told ABC's George Stephanopoulos . "I put family and country first."

Ruh roh. If Cohen -- now potentially facing any number of criminal charges -- is putting family and then country first, then, um, he's not putting Donald Trump first. Which is worrisome if you are Trump.

Here's the thing: No one really knows what Cohen knows (or doesn't) about the President himself, the 2016 campaign, the first family or the many business dealings of the Trump Organization.

What we do know: Cohen has been, for years, the guy who fixed things for Donald Trump. The person who was willing to do what was necessary to make sure Trump was able to glide past potential pitfalls.

Like, for example, allegations just before the 2016 election from a porn star named Stormy Daniels that she had engaged in an extramarital affair with Trump. Concerned that those revelations might jeopardize Trump's chances of winning, Cohen established an LLC in Delaware -- Essential Consultants -- to funnel $130,000 to Daniels in exchange for her silence. Once that payment was revealed, Cohen said he had acted entirely on his own, with no guidance from Trump or anyone in the campaign. And that he had used his own money to pay off Daniels, which wound up being false -- as Rudy Giuliani exposed shortly after coming on as a member of Trump's legal team. Trump had actually paid Cohen in a series of monthly installments -- although, according to Trump allies, he had no idea what the money was for or what it was going to.

Ahem.

The Daniels episode is illustrative of Cohen -- and his role in Trump's orbit. So, too, is the fact that during the election, the National Enquirer would send early copies of stories about Trump's opponents to Cohen. The Enquirer also gave Cohen sign-off power on stories about Trump before they ran, according to The Washington Post . So, yeah.

Cohen did Trump's dirty work -- in the campaign and before it. Was Trump aware of all (or any) of it? Who knows? Likely not, allowing him plausible deniability if/when things ever went sideways.

I tend to think of the Trump-Cohen relationship like a big-time college basketball coach and one of his assistants charged with recruiting. The head coach knows -- in a general way -- that the assistant is pushing the boundaries of acceptable conduct in order to get the best kids to come to the school. The head coach assumes, for his own sake, that pushing the boundaries does not mean breaking the rules. But either way, he doesn't have any working knowledge of what the assistant is doing. Good kids come to the school, the head coach is happy. The assistant is well compensated. Win-win.

But if the assistant gets caught doing something illegal, then things change. The assistant, desperate to cut a deal for himself, may seek to implicate those above him in the chain of command -- dropping as many dimes as he can to save his butt. And that's when the head coach might need to start worrying.

Which brings me back to Cohen. While no charges have officially been filed against him, there's an expectation that the Southern District of New York has plenty against Cohen. (Agents raided his home, hotel and office in April and seized millions of files .)

And Cohen now seems to be wavering -- bigly -- in his past unflinching support of Trump. In fact, a friend of his who is in regular touch with him, told CNN this : "He knows a lot of things about the President and he's not averse to talking in the right situation. If they want information on Trump, he's willing to give it."

Now. Some of that may simply be positioning and posturing -- trying to get Cohen the best possible plea deal for himself. But it's hard to imagine that the Southern District prosecutors would give Cohen a deal if there was nothing that he had to tell them about a bigger fish.

Is that fish Trump? And how much does Cohen know? And on what?

Lots and lots of questions we don't know the answers to. But the fact that Cohen is now publicly sending signals that he is not averse to making a deal has to make the President nervous.

If it doesn't, it should.

__label__world (CNN) Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former wife of the late President Nelson Mandela , has died at age 81.

The family said in a statement that she passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year.

"Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela was one of the greatest icons of the struggle against apartheid," the statement said. "She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country."

Her death came as a shock. "None of us had predicted this," a family spokesman told CNN.

Madikizela-Mandela was known as the "Mother of the Nation" because of her struggle against white-minority rule in South Africa.

Nelson and Winnie Mandela raise clenched fists to supporters upon Nelson's release from jail in February 1990.

She was married to Nelson Mandela for 38 years, including the 27 years he was imprisoned on an island near Cape Town.

"She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the struggle for justice in South Africa one of its most recognizable faces," the statement said.

The couple were divorced in 1996, two years after Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black President. They had two daughters together. Nelson Mandela died in 2013.

A longtime stalwart of the ruling African National Congress, or ANC, political party, Madikizela-Mandela was a member of South Africa's parliament at the time of her death.

One of the last official visits she received was from current South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who went with her to Soweto township last month to encourage people to register to vote in next year's presidential election.

On Monday, Ramaphosa praised Madikizela-Mandela as "an advocate for the dispossessed and the marginalized" and "a voice for the voiceless."

"Even at the darkest moments of our struggle for liberation, Mam' Winnie was an abiding symbol of the desire of our people to be free," Ramaphosa said in a statement. "In the midst of repression, she was a voice of defiance and resistance. In the face of exploitation, she was a champion of justice and equality."

A memorial service for Mandela will be held April 11 and an "official national" funeral will be April 14, Ramaphosa said.

Born in 1936 in what is now known as the Eastern Cape province, Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela was the daughter of a history teacher.

As a young social worker, she married Nelson Mandela in 1958 at age 22, and stood by him in the years following his 1964 conviction and life imprisonment sentence for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.

Madikizela-Mandela led an international campaign calling for his release.

While Nelson Mandela was banned from reading newspapers, his wife was his link to the outside world. Madikizela-Mandela told him of the changes taking place in his homeland and became his often outspoken and controversial public voice.

Nelson Mandela was finally freed in 1990. His defiance of white-minority rule and his long incarceration for fighting against state-sanctioned segregation focused world attention on South Africa's apartheid system, making him the symbol of the struggle to end the practice and bring racial equality to his country.

Outside Africa, Madikizela-Mandela was known largely because of her ex-husband, but in South Africa she was the mouthpiece and face of the bitter struggle against the racist regime.

"She refused to be bowed by the imprisonment of her husband, the perpetual harassment of her family by security forces, detentions, bannings and banishment," said Archbishop Desmond Tutu in a statement. "Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists."

A controversial legacy

Although Madikizela-Mandela, who suffered from diabetes, helped usher in a new, more equitable South African political system during her lifetime, she was also entangled in a number of scandals over the years.

In December 1988, her bodyguards, known as the Mandela United Football Club, kidnapped four boys belonging to another anti-apartheid party. One of them, Stompie Moeketsi, was murdered a few days later.

In May 1991 she was sentenced to six years in prison for kidnapping in relation to the incident, but the sentence was later reduced to a fine.

Madikizela-Mandela bounced back and in 1993 was elected president of the ANC's women's league. In 1994, when her then-husband became President, she was elected to parliament and became deputy arts and science minister in the country's first multi-racial government.

Ever the feisty campaigner, Madikizela-Mandela continued to provoke controversy with her attacks on the government and her strident appeals to radical young black followers.

She was expelled from her husband's cabinet a year later.

Madikizela-Mandela was re-elected for a second parliamentary term in 1999 but resigned four years later after she was convicted of fraudulently taking out bank loans and theft -- the loans were used to help poor people.

Her conviction for theft was overturned a year later because she had not recognized any personal gain from her actions.

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission also accused her of human rights abuses during the apartheid years.

Something of a firebrand, she continued to clash with successive ANC presidents in and out of parliament for the rest of her life.

Tributes to Madikizela-Mandela

Madikizela-Mandela was also close to Julius Malema, the leader of the left-wing populist Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party. He made his tribute on Twitter with a simple black frame and crying emojis.

In 2011, Madikizela-Mandela was the subject of a Hollywood biopic starring Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Hudson, along with an opera that premiered in Pretoria, South Africa. She did not like the film.

"I was not consulted," she told CNN in June that year. "I am still alive, and I think that it is a total disrespect to come to South Africa, make a movie about my struggle, and call that movie some translation of a romantic life of Winnie Mandela."

The 2017 British documentary "Winnie" painted a more realistic portrait of her. As the tributes continued to roll in Monday, one of the most tweeted was from the British actor Idris Elba.

Rest in peace Mama Winnie. My heart is heavy right now. You lived a full and important life contributing to the liberation of a nation by force and ACTUAL ACTIVISM. You will never be forgotten. 👊🏾 — Idris Elba (@idriselba) April 2, 2018

"Rest in peace Mama Winnie. My heart is heavy right now," the actor wrote. You lived a full and important life contributing to the liberation of a nation by force and ACTUAL ACTIVISM. You will never be forgotten."

South Africa's parliament said it was "shocked and saddened" by Madikizela-Mandela's death.

"Today we have indeed lost a great leader, a champion of freedom and development, a people's hero, and a Mother, and a defender of the down-trodden," it said in statement Monday. "May her soul rest in peace."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he holds his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin personally responsible for Moscow's attempts to interfere in the 2016 US election.

"I would because he's in charge of the country just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country," Trump said. "So certainly as the leader of the country you would have to hold him responsible."

Trump's views surrounding election meddling have been repeatedly called into question. As recently as this week -- immediately after his one-on-one meeting with Putin -- Trump appeared to believe Putin's denial over the US intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

"In a key sentence in my remarks I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't,'" Trump said on Tuesday. He explained he had reviewed a transcript and video of his remarks.

"The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia,' " he said. "Sort of a double negative."

The White House was once again sent into clean-up mode Wednesday when Trump said "no" when a reporter asked him if Russia was still targeting the United States. Press secretary Sarah Sanders later claimed Trump was saying "no" to answering questions, not to whether the Russians are targeting the US.

When pressed in his Wednesday interview on whether his acceptance of the US intelligence analysis meant that he thought Putin lied when denying any Russian involvement, Trump said he "didn't want to get into whether or not he's lying."

"I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted," Trump said.

He said his message to Putin warning against future interference was "very strong" during their meeting Monday.

"I let him know we can't have this. We're not going to have it. And that's the way it's going to be," Trump said.

Trump also said once again that he wants to sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election and Russians' ties to the Trump campaign.

"I've always wanted to do an interview, because look, there's been no collusion," Trump said.
__label__politics (CNN) Democrats have hit an unexpected speed bump in their drive to regain control of Congress: unsettling signs that the party may not generate as much turnout or support among Latino voters this fall as it expected.

Despite a procession of provocations from President Donald Trump -- from ending deportation protections for so-called "Dreamers," young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents, to his now-terminated policy that resulted in children being separated from their undocumented parents at the border -- a growing number of Democratic strategists are privately concerned that their candidates are not consolidating Latino support as much as they anticipated in several key races.

While cautioning that there is still time to reverse the trend, they point to signs of wavering Hispanic support and engagement in House districts in Texas, Nevada, Florida and California, and in Senate races in Texas, Nevada, Florida and Arizona.

"I still think it's a little too soon to push the panic button, but having said that, we are not seeing the types of numbers with Hispanic voters that we should be seeing with the most hostile person to ever hold public office against Hispanics as the President," said Fernand Amandi, principal at Bendixen & Amandi International, a Democratic polling firm that specializes in studying Latino voters. "And that in and of itself is a concern. I'm flabbergasted."

Private Democratic polling has found surprisingly lackluster results among Hispanics in such House races as the San Antonio-area House seat, where Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones is facing Republican Rep. Will Hurd; the exurban Los Angeles seat that Republican Rep. Steve Knight is defending against Democrat Katie Hill; and the battle in Orange County, California, for the open seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.

Not all Democratic strategists see cause for alarm. Latino Decisions, another Democratic polling firm that specializes in Latino voters, and Stanley B. Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, have each recently released separate surveys for Democratic organizations that find the party maintaining a healthy lead over Republicans when Hispanics are asked which party they intend to support in House elections.

Yet virtually everyone on both sides of this Democratic debate agrees on one point: Despite all his confrontational rhetoric and policies, Trump alone appears unlikely to reverse the usual falloff in Hispanic turnout during midterm elections, and he may not even widen the typical Democratic advantage among them in their vote preferences.

Neither public polls nor private research suggests an organic surge to the polls among Hispanic voters outraged by Trump is developing the way it appears to be coalescing among college-educated white women and African-American women. And that means Democrats face their typical challenge of energizing a community whose voter participation has remained stubbornly low.

"I think that the turnout is not guaranteed and all of the candidates and the interest groups have a lot of work to do," said Matt Barreto, co-founder and managing partner of Latino Decisions. "They don't want the anger to sit there and fester and turn into so much frustration that people don't feel that there is anything they can do."

From Florida to California

The alarms among Democrats over Hispanic intentions have been triggered partly by a series of recent public polls showing their candidates underperforming with those voters in several key races.

The findings start in Florida, where a recent Mason-Dixon survey showed Hispanics providing Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson only a narrow 44 percent to 39 percent lead over Republican Rick Scott. Republicans typically run better among Hispanics in Florida than elsewhere, because the state's large Cuban population has historically tilted right.

But Democrats have been improving because of their strength among Florida's growing Puerto Rican community, which has swelled again in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Exit polls found that Hillary Clinton beat Trump among the state's Hispanic voters by 27 percentage points in 2016. Yet Scott's aggressive outreach to the community has raised fears among Democrats that Nelson won't nearly match that margin with Latinos.

Several Texas polls have also shown surprisingly modest advantages for Democrat Beto O'Rourke over Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The most recent Quinnipiac Poll gave O'Rourke just a 12-percentage-point lead over Cruz among Latinos. The nonpartisan Texas Lyceum Poll gave O'Rourke a comparable 15-point lead among all registered Latinos and a wider, but still subpar, 19-point lead among the Latinos the survey deemed likely to vote.

Joshua Blank, manager of polling and research at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project, says that while most Texas Latinos support Democrats, there's no evidence yet that Trump's agenda is prompting much defection among the significant minority of them who consistently back Republicans.

"The reality is there are about one-third of Texas Hispanics who hold relatively restrictionist attitudes on immigration, support Republican positions, support Republican candidates ... and they were doing that while (Republican) politicians in this state were spending $800 million on border security and trying to pass sanctuary city laws with 'show me your papers' provisions," Blank said. "It's not that Trump comes along and Texas Hispanics are saying: 'What's going on here?' It's what has been going on here, and they have already arrived at those opinions."

In a third key Senate race, a public poll in Arizona , from OH Predictive Insights and the local ABC channel, found Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema underperforming among Latinos against her most likely Republican opponent, Rep. Martha McSally. The survey actually found McSally leading with those voters, though few in either party consider that a possibility on Election Day, and OH Predictive Insights, which conducted the poll, cautions that the margin of error among Latino voters is high because the sample is small. Even so, some Democrats privately worry that Sinema has focused too much on convincing center-right white voters that she is concerned about border security and not enough on persuading Latinos she will defend their interests.

Also raising some eyebrows: The most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll put Trump's approval among Latinos at 39 percent, well above his 28 percent share of the vote among them in 2016, according to exit polls.

Some Latino activists have long viewed public polls of their community -- including exit polls -- as unreliable and contended they tend to underrepresent respondents who speak mostly Spanish, a group that leans more toward Democrats. And other surveys show less reason for Democratic concern.

The most recent national Quinnipiac University poll, for instance, put Trump's Latino approval at 27 percent -- almost exactly equal to his vote among them -- and in Monday's weekly Gallup average, just 23 percent of Latinos approved. A recent Latino Decisions poll in 61 competitive House districts, conducted for a consortium of civil rights advocacy groups, found Democrats holding a roughly 40-percentage-point advantage among Latino voters.

Trump is 'in the strongman tradition'

Amandi says that despite these mixed signals in polling, he sees evidence that Trump and the GOP have maintained a beachhead of support among Latinos.

"My instant analysis is it's because of the economy," he says. "These are people who are not necessarily paying attention to every inning of political baseball. They are working. They are maybe getting a little bit more money."

Moreover, Amandi says, even Trump's belligerent style has found an audience among some Latinos, especially older men: "He's in the strongman tradition of the Latin American caudillo."

Yet Barreto's poll for the coalition of civil rights groups still found that about three-fourths of Latinos opposed both the border wall and Trump's now-abandoned "zero tolerance" policy and nearly 90 percent supported legal status for the "Dreamers." Barreto says the only reason Republican performance among Latinos might look relatively stronger in current surveys -- or on Election Day itself -- is if turnout among them remains low. The reason is that Latinos who lean Republican also tend to be older -- and thus more reliable voters in low-turnout elections.

"I have not seen any data that I would consider an accurate reflection of Latinos that Republicans are increasing (their share), or they will be over 25 percent of those voters," Barreto says. "The only reason it would be different is not that they are winning over more people; it would be if some Latinos who are Democratically leaning stay home."

Recent history offers evidence for that argument. In the House races during the low-turnout midterm elections of 2010 and 2014, Republicans won a higher share of Latino voters -- 38 percent and 36 percent, respectively -- than they did in House contests during the higher-turnout presidential years of 2016, 2012 and 2008 (from 30 to 32 percent), according to exit polls.

What about turnout?

That contrast highlights what remains the biggest concern about Latinos among Democratic strategists: Will they vote in sufficient numbers? In the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, Latino turnout plummeted from its levels in the presidential elections just two years earlier: While about half of eligible Latinos voted in each of those presidential elections, a low number to begin with, the figure fell to under one-third in 2010 and a little over one-fourth in 2014.

Turnout among Latinos remained essentially stagnant at just under 50 percent in 2016 despite all of Trump's harsh rhetoric at the community. Barreto says his survey found a high level of anger at Trump among Latinos, especially younger generations, and he argues that anger has been a good predictor of heightened turnout. On the other hand, public surveys measuring how closely voters are following the election and whether they are certain to vote have mostly found Latinos still lagging other groups.

Poring over such ambiguous evidence, Henry Fernandez, a principal at the African American Research Collaborative, which studies issues relating to black voters, says the direction of Latino turnout this fall is not yet clear.

He says the increased Republican reliance on racially confrontational messages in the Trump era -- such as comments about the Central American gang MS-13 during the Virginia governor's race last fall -- has clearly prompted a backlash among African-American voters, who "respond most strongly" to any political argument that targets racial divisions, even if they are not the direct subject of the attacks.

Even though the MS-13 attacks failed to lift Republican Ed Gillespie during the Virginia race, the barrage of ads in Tuesday's Ohio special House election accusing Democrat Danny O'Connor of supporting "amnesty for illegals" and "open borders" makes clear that Republicans are committed to stressing racially infused immigration themes through the fall.

Whether that provokes a surge in Latino participation, Fernandez said, may turn on how the nonpartisan groups and Democratic organizations working on turnout respond.

"If the focus of the parties and those organizations is on the predictable electorate, that would be a mistake," he said during a recent conference call with reporters to release the Latino Decisions survey. "There are many more people who are at play who could be potential voters. It's not just a question of what will those folks do on their own, but where will investments be made to encourage people to get out to vote?"
__label__world (CNN) Authorities in Nepal are launching a crackdown after it emerged trekking and mountaineering agencies were defrauding insurance companies for millions of dollars by charging them for unnecessary helicopter evacuations from Everest and other mountains in the Himalayas.

According to Ghanashyam Upadhyaya, a spokesman for the Nepal Tourism and Civil Aviation Ministry, the authorities are taking action against 15 companies -- including tour agencies, hospitals and helicopter businesses -- for their involvement in fraudulent activities.

Traveller Assist, a medical assistance company, said its investigations showed that in the first eight months of 2018, there were around 1,600 helicopter rescues in Nepal, at least 35% of which were fraudulent, costing insurers upward of $4 million.

Insurers had threatened to pull out of Nepal, potentially devastating tourism to the Himalayan nation, over the helicopter scams. Companies gave the government until September 1 to take action.

In a statement Tuesday, Traveller Assist Managing Director Jonathan Bancroft welcomed the government's investigation, adding that the "sheer scale of fraud and corruption in Nepal is so widespread that even if a company isn't involved in it, they are well aware that it happens."

A helicopter flies over hikers headed for Everest Base Camp. Companies have been found to be billing tourists for unnecessary evacuations.

__label__politics Imagine how it felt for the Trump administration.

Last month, we documented how the White House and President Donald Trump's Cabinet have been working hard to reshape the federal government while everyone else has been focused on the interwoven staffing dramas, personal betrayals, diplomatic foibles, guilty pleas and guilty verdicts that have hurtled around Trump's nucleus. Not to mention the forced separation of families at the border, a crisis that remains unresolved despite months of court orders.

It's hard to look away from a train wreck. It's impossible to look away from successive wrecks.

That's what this summer, from Memorial Day until almost Labor Day, has felt like after the high note of a successful North Korea summit through a disastrous meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to Trump's betrayal by former aides and the dramas du jour in between. It's enough to make you forget, for a moment, that the President is on the cusp of getting a second justice on the Supreme Court.

Here are some of the key moments from a summer that included no break:

North Korea talks stall after summit

Trump poses with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un at the start of their historic US-North Korea summit, at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore on June 12, 2018.

The summer actually started off pretty well for Trump when he upended decades of foreign policy and met June 12 with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. It was controversial, sure -- everything he does is controversial -- but it showed a Trump in control, shaking things up like he promised, and moving, he said, away from a nuclear North Korea. Trump's declarations that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat, issued immediately on Twitter upon his return to the US, have proved premature, however, as talks led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to agree with North Koreans on details of an agreement have stalled. Trump canceled a planned Pompeo trip to North Korea on Aug. 24.

A moment of weakness makes Putin look strong in Helsinki

Trump speaks beside Russian President Vladimir Putin during a press conference after their meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018.

When Trump stood next to Putin on July 16, he could have stood up for US intelligence officials, who have long unanimously said Russia actively interfered in the 2016 US election. But Trump won that election, so he's been loath to accept anything that questions it. Particularly when there's an ongoing investigation (he calls it a witch hunt) into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. So Trump seemed to side with Putin while he was standing next to the Russian leader, instead of his own government. It was a moment that gobsmacked the international community.

While Trump was busy trying to clean up in the days that followed, Putin's Kremlin started referring to military agreements he'd made during their private conversation. The Pentagon was caught unaware. You might ask yourself why in the midst of the Russia investigation Trump was meeting with the Russian leader. That's a valid question, particularly since Trump invited the meeting. It's hard to find anyone who says Putin didn't emerge with the upper hand

A self-inflicted immigration crisis that took children from their parents

JUST WATCHED 2,000 children wait to be reunited with parents Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2,000 children wait to be reunited with parents 02:47

The dramas of the Trump administration commanded headlines, but at points they gave way to the real policy problem that resulted in the US government taking undocumented immigrant children from their parents at the border. The "zero tolerance" policy was announced by the administration earlier in the year as a further deterrent to illegal immigration. Its scope led to a genuine and bipartisan public outcry over the summer, however, as it became clear that young children were being taken from their parents for what US law considers a misdemeanor crime. A series of legal cases ensued. The administration has yet to return all of the separated children to their parents

Michael Cohen pleads guilty, implicates Trump

JUST WATCHED The evolution of Trump and Cohen's relationship Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The evolution of Trump and Cohen's relationship 02:50

Once Trump's confidant, lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen is now more likely to be called "RAT" by his former boss, who prizes loyalty above all else. Cohen said last week in court that Trump had directed him to engineer payments to hush up a former Playboy model and former porn star just before the election. Both alleged they had affairs with the now-President years earlier. He denies those allegations, but there's tape of him talking about at least one of the payoffs with Cohen.

That Trump's good friend David Pecker, CEO of the company that owns the National Enquirer , which sat on the story about Playboy model Karen McDougal's alleged affair, and the CFO of the Trump organization were given immunity for the Cohen investigation makes the possibility of further legal action all the more frightening for the President. It was after the Cohen allegations that Trump took part in a federal crime that people again started talking about the possibility of impeachment. That kind of action still seems unlikely, to say the least. But being implicated as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal crime is never a good thing for a President.

Paul Manafort found guilty, won't flip

JUST WATCHED Manafort found guilty on 8 counts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Manafort found guilty on 8 counts 02:34

The Russia investigation continues, but special counsel Robert Mueller got his first conviction when Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chief, was convicted last week in a Virginia federal court on eight of 18 counts of tax and bank fraud. There's another Manafort trial coming in DC in September. The Virginia court, remember, is the one Manafort's attorneys were hoping would be friendlier. Trump's lawyers have repeatedly demanded that Mueller wrap up his investigation before the November election. But Mueller recently asked a federal judge for more time to work with the cooperating Michael Flynn. And Manafort's second trial has yet to start. Which makes it seem like Mueller will not be rushed, much to Trump's frustration at what he continues to attack as a "witch hunt." It's a witch hunt with a growing number of guilty pleas and now guilty verdicts.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to President Donald Trump, said Sunday that the author of an anonymous New York Times op-ed lambasting Trump wrote the piece to make trouble, not for patriotic reasons.

"I think the motivation was to sow discord and create chaos," Conway said on CNN's "State of the Union."

The Times' opinion section published an op-ed last week by an anonymous writer who identified as both a member of the Trump administration and the "resistance" to some of his policies and behavior. A wave of top administration officials condemned the piece and denied authoring it, and Trump called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate who authored the piece, although it offers no indication of a crime.

Conway said Sunday that she did not know if the person who wrote the op-ed broke the law, but she posited that any writer who would do such a thing might also have divulged classified information.

"We also don't know what this person has said to try to get that op-ed in The New York Times or what he or she has said to other people," Conway said.
__label__world (CNN) Russia will expel 60 US diplomats and close the US Consulate in St. Petersburg, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday, in retaliation for a similar move by Washington.

The 60 diplomats -- 58 from the US mission in Moscow and two from Yekaterinburg -- were declared "persona non grata" for activities "incompatible with diplomatic status," the ministry said, ordering them to leave the country by April 5.

US Ambassador Jon Huntsman had been summoned to the Foreign Ministry to be told of the decision, Lavrov said.

In response, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that Moscow "should not be acting like a victim."

She rejected the Russian government's suggestion that it is taking reciprocal action: "We don't see this as a diplomatic tit for tat," Nauert told reporters shortly after Moscow announced the move.

A bag that the 24-year-old man was carrying caught on fire and was later found to contain a plastic bottle with flammable material inside it, according to the statement.

"The man harbors extremist ideology, according to initial examination," the statement said, adding that the incident resulted in no casualties or damage.

At around 1:30 p.m. local time, reports began to emerge of an incident near the US Embassy in Cairo and the Embassy warned American citizens to avoid the building.

"We are aware of a reported incident on Simon Bolivar Street in Cairo. Please avoid the area and monitor local media for updates," the Embassy wrote on its Twitter account . "U.S. Citizens should/not come to the Embassy at this time," it added.

__label__politics (CNN) President Bill Clinton's former personal lawyer is endorsing Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that the judge would be a "strong advocate for decency and civility."

"Brett is the most qualified person any Republican President could possibly have nominated," Clinton's former lawyer Robert Bennett wrote in a letter Tuesday to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley and the top Democrat on the committee Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

The two men crossed paths when Kavanaugh was part of independent counsel Ken Starr's team that was investigating Clinton, and Bennett was Clinton's personal lawyer in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit in the mid-1990s, which "hardly seems like the winning recipe for a close friendship," Bennett wrote.

"Much like politics, litigation often brings out people's worst tribal instincts, and the temptation to view your opponent as a villain can be especially overwhelming when the stakes are high," Bennett wrote. "Despite being on opposite sides of the Starr investigation, however, Brett and I managed to avoid falling prey to that trap."

He added that their friendship was in large part Kavanaugh's doing, saying that the 53-year-old appellate judge possesses "an innate sense of fairness and civility that has governed his relationships with allies and adversaries equally."

(CNN) Dozens of schoolchildren on a field trip were killed in Yemen last week when a Saudi-led airstrike hit their bus. More than 50 people died; nearly 80 were wounded. Many victims were younger than 10.

Speaking by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a few days after the attack, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo "thanked the Crown Prince for Saudi Arabia's support for northeast Syria's urgent stabilization needs, its engagement with the Iraqi government, and its offer to help Iraq address its water and electricity shortages," according to the State Department. He reportedly never mentioned the bombing.

The decision to work with Saudi Arabia and condone its brutality did not begin with the Trump administration. A long string of American presidents has been deferential to this oppressive regime because it is seen as a source of stability in the Middle East, and because it is sometimes willing to do dirty work in America's broader interests.

But the Trump government is especially sympathetic to the Saudis, even at the expense of our closest allies. It says a lot when you're throwing your lot in with Saudi Arabia over Canada.

This despicable embrace of the Saudis should be a bigger scandal than it is. But the administration is benefiting from its own self-induced chaos and dysfunction. American journalists and the public are so focused on our domestic disorder that they pay ever less attention to conflicts abroad.

Our expectations have also adjusted steadily downward. It's disgusting that Pompeo didn't push the Saudis on their recent slaughter of children, but is it surprising?

After initially claiming that the attack was "a legitimate military operation," the Saudi government has now pledged to conduct an internal investigation. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called for "a thorough and transparent investigation into the incident," after refusing to confirm details because "we are not there on the ground."

Never mind that those Saudi Arabia internal investigations typically result in clearing them of any wrongdoing , and that the US government supplies many of the weapons used to kill thousands in a war-ravaged, starving country.

Saudi Arabia is an unapologetic violator of human rights, within its own borders and outside of them. In Yemen, the Saudi government has not only killed thousands in bombings, but it blocked humanitarian aid and other imports, triggering a massive famine and the worst cholera outbreak in history. Starving civilians seems to be an intentional part of its military strategy; so is barring journalists and human rights observers.

Yemen wasn't exactly within the sights of most Americans before Trump's election. But now, our interests have turned almost entirely inward, on the left and the right. As the midterms approach, the overwhelming weight of the political conversation is about Trump and domestic policy; immigration is about as close as we get to focusing on an issue related to people beyond our borders, and that's only because they're coming to those borders.

This political myopia makes sense, given the degree to which Trump and his cronies have upended American political norms, reshaped the Republican Party into something even more power-hungry and intellectually vacant, and threatened our very democracy.

JUST WATCHED Video shows bus moments before airstrike Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows bus moments before airstrike 04:02

But it also means that our narrowed view pushes crucial global issues to the periphery, and that the worst of American foreign policy is increasingly ignored. Journalists are doing their damndest to tell these stories and to press the powerful for accountability. But this administration has proven time and again that it is unapologetically unaccountable to the press.

And most average Americans either don't care about what happens to Yemeni kids or are too overwhelmed by immigrant kids held in chain-link pens here to add one more complex geopolitical issue to the mix.

And so we get Pompeo issuing thank-yous instead of excoriations and Trump staying silent (do we think he could even find Yemen on a map?). The press is laudably covering all of it. But not a single person will pay a price at the ballot box. Most Americans won't even notice.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Aerosmith's Steven Tyler felt some sweet emotion, and a little jaded, when he heard President Donald Trump use his band's song "Livin' on the Edge" before a campaign rally Tuesday.

In a cease and desist letter sent Wednesday, Tyler had his attorneys tell the President he could dream on if he thought he could continue using the song.

"This is not about Democrats vs. Republicans," Tyler said in a statement Wednesday.

"I do not let anyone use my songs without my permission. My music is for causes not political campaigns or rallies. Protecting copyright and songwriters is what I've been fighting for even before this current administration took office. This is one of the reasons why Joe and I have been pushing the Senate to pass the Music Modernization Act. NO is a complete sentence," he added.

The letter notes that this isn't the first time Trump has used Aerosmith music without the band's permission, referencing two previous cease and desist letters sent in 2015 during the presidential campaign.

__label__politics Phoenix (CNN) In replacing John McCain, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is set to make the most important decision of his political career -- one that could determine his future in Republican politics.

Ducey faces massive, competing pressures in selecting someone to fill McCain's Senate seat until a 2020 special election. Donald Trump and his supporters will want a reliable vote in the Senate and will blame Ducey if his appointee breaks with the President. McCain's camp, meanwhile, could prefer someone in the "Maverick" mold or a placeholder who wouldn't seek re-election.

Then there's Arizona's rapid evolution from reliably Republican to a diverse swing state where Senate seats won't be easy for the GOP to hold.

Republicans say Ducey is aware of those competing factors but aren't sure how he'll balance them.

"Of course he's considered what he would do," one Republican strategist close to Ducey said. "Of course. It's a very high responsibility."

But, the strategist said, Ducey directed aides and advisers to "not engage in any kind of speculation at all" about the appointment -- including discussing what qualifications and background Ducey might be looking for -- until after McCain was buried in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday.

"I don't think he wants to look backward. He's a young man, politically speaking, and so he wants to be able to narrate something about him here too," said veteran Arizona GOP strategist Chuck Coughlin. "Arguably this is the biggest decision of his career."

The former chief executive officer of Cold Stone Creamery, Ducey brought a cold, corporate style with him into the political world. "If you cross him, you're done," one Arizona Republican said. "He's got a very tight hand on that ship."

For a governor, Ducey's political orbit is small. His chief of staff, Kirk Adams, is a former Arizona House speaker who serves as Ducey's primary go-between with state lawmakers. Danny Seiden, who left Ducey's office to join a law firm, is another government and campaign veteran close to Ducey. Washington-based consultant Doug Goodyear, who maintains a Scottsdale home and was Ducey's neighbor, is close to the governor. And Republican strategist Danny Diaz was Ducey's general consultant before he managed Jeb Bush's presidential campaign.

Ducey has a working relationship with Trump, those close to him say -- and Trump's endorsement of Ducey after Tuesday's primary could be read as a sign that the White House is paying attention to his moves -- but he's closer to Vice President Mike Pence, who was elected governor of Indiana two years before Ducey became governor of Arizona.

People in Ducey's inner circle told friends as recently as Wednesday that they weren't sure who the governor would choose.

The only word from Ducey's office has been the lone statement senior adviser Daniel Ruiz has sent reporters since the weekend.

"Out of respect for the life and legacy of Senator John McCain and his family, Governor Ducey will not be making any announcements about an appointment until after the Senator is laid to rest. Now is a time for remembering and honoring a consequential life well lived," Ruiz said in the statement.

While Ducey's camp is quiet, speculation among Arizona Republicans has ranged from several women Ducey has appointed to state government posts to Cindy McCain.

Former Sen. Jon Kyl, who retired more than five years ago and is seen as a potential placeholder until the special election in 2020, wouldn't comment on whether he is interested in the job.

"I am not commenting on any of this until Senator McCain is laid to rest," he said in an email.

Ducey is likely to look for someone who would have the support of McCain's family, several Arizona Republicans said.

"I don't think they get to decide, but I think that'll certainly factor in," said Constantin Querard, an Arizona Republican strategist.

Arizona held its primary for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake on Tuesday. Rep. Martha McSally won a hard-fought three-way race and will face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in November.

The prospect of another Senate primary -- with outsider candidates like Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio looming as possible contenders -- is something national Republicans are likely to want Ducey to avoid.

Querard said former Rep. Matt Salmon and current Rep. David Schweikert are among the potential appointees who would be unlikely to face a challenge from the right.

"A lot of the other names you hear," he said, "the first thought is, 'Oh my gosh, we're going to have another primary in two years.'"

Adams, Ducey's chief of staff, is one possible contender. The downsides to an Adams pick are that he's much like the governor: A relatively young white male in a state that has never elected a female senator, and where diversity could help the GOP hold a seat that is sure to be a top Democratic target in 2020. It's the same problem that would come with appointing a current or former member of Congress like Salmon, Schweikert or another often-mentioned possibility, former Rep. John Shadegg.

Karrin Taylor Robson, a wealthy developer and member of the Arizona Board of Regents, is a potential choice that would please the GOP donor community in Arizona. Her father was a state Senate president and her brother was a Maricopa County supervisor who brawled with then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

State treasurer Eileen Klein, a chief of staff to former Gov. Jan Brewer and former member of the state Board of Regents, was appointed by Ducey to her job just months ago and is often among the first people mentioned by Arizona Republicans for the job. She replaced former state treasurer Jeff DeWit, who took a Trump appointment at NASA and, despite being close to Trump, is not seen as a candidate due to his history of brawling with Ducey.

Another possible contender is Barbara Barrett, a business executive and former ambassador to Finland. The knock on Barrett: Bad blood with McCain dating back to Barrett's 1994 effort to oust Gov. Fife Symington, a McCain ally, in a Republican primary.

__label__world (CNN) Myanmar's ruling junta of generals and its ineffectual civilian government has little to fear from the international community -- for now.

On Monday a United Nations fact finding mission investigating Myanmar's treatment of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled to neighboring Bangladesh last year recommended the country's military leaders be prosecuted for genocide

For that to happen, however, the United Nations Security Council needs to refer it to the International Criminal Court in the Hague. That looks unlikely.

"The UN Security Council is paralyzed, the fact that it hasn't moved on Syria or Yemen just undermines the whole operation of the Council, it undermines the international criminal court and its ability to actually bring about international justice," said Cecilia Jacobs, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University College of Asia and the Pacific in Canberra.

What these Rohingya refugees want you to know

What these Rohingya refugees want you to know

Myanmar rejects the findings and the accusations. When the UN Human Rights Council decided last year to send the mission to investigate, the Myanmar foreign minister said investigators would "do more to inflame, rather than resolve the issues at this time."

On Tuesday, Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Myanmar's presidential office, told CNN via text message that the government had already formed its own independent commission and there was no comment on the mission's findings.

State Counselor and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was singled out in the UN mission's statements, saying that she "has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine State."

No expectation of domestic justice

The damning UN report contains allegations of murder, imprisonment and sexual violence against the Rohingyas, carried out by the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw.

"Military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages. The Tatmadaw's tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine State, but also in northern Myanmar," the report said.

However, there was no possibility that Myanmar's investigation would ever really hold anyone senior accountable, says Aaron Connelly, a research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

"I make the case that Aung San Suu Kyi and this government has absolutely no intention to prosecute in any kind of transparent or balanced way crimes against humanity in Rakhine State," he told CNN. "I wouldn't be surprised if they go after some of the Rohingya militants, but they're not going to really go after the commanders who ordered these attacks."

JUST WATCHED Survivor tells of brutality in Myanmar Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Survivor tells of brutality in Myanmar 02:23

The Myanmar government has long claimed that its actions were in response to an attack on police outposts by Rohingya militants said to belong to the ARSA insurgent group.

Connelly said there might be " token prosecutions of enlisted personnel or junior officers," but as in the case of two Reuters journalists facing trial in Myanmar for their reporting on the Rohingya, "they've actually prosecuted more people involved in revealing the massacre than they have people involved in the massacre, so we're unlikely to see domestic accountability."

Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, have been charged under the state's Official Secrets Act and face up to 14 years of jail for their reporting on the Rohingya Muslim minority and the hundreds of thousands who fled to Bangladesh last year to escape violence and official persecution.

Depending on the UN Security Council

An absence of justice at home leaves the international community few options, particularly if the UN Security Council itself is unlikely to help, for several reasons.

Myanmar's main ally in the Security Council is China, and China has long defended the once isolated regime while the rest of the world has tried to sanction Myanmar's generals over the years for their political persecution of democracy activists, including in the past, Aung San Suu Kyi herself.

Russia has often sided with China against the other members of the Council.

Yet the administration of US President Trump, in particular his national security adviser John Bolton, is also unwilling to refer cases to the International Criminal Court because of the precedent it would set.

"The US mission to the UN has made it known that they're not going to make any ICC referrals at least as long as the prosecutors seek to investigate US war crimes in Afghanistan," noted Connelly. "John Bolton is also Enemy No.1 of the ICC , and has let it be known that there won't be any referrals as long as he's the national security adviser."

Another path to justice

There is another way, one which lawyers including Toby Cadman have pursued without having to deal with the UN at all.

"What we're trying to do is to get the International Criminal Court to use Bangladesh's territorial jurisdiction and look at forced displacement, and they have the jurisdiction to do that," he told CNN.

Because Myanmar isn't a party to the ICC, the international body has no jurisdiction to bring charges there. But the flight of hundreds of thousands of people from Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh -- which is a signatory -- might give the ICC an opening and an opportunity to still prosecute for genocide, Cadman argues.

"The forced displacement is an element of genocidal intent, it's to remove the Rohingya from Myanmar by forcing them out by killing, raping and looting. The forcing is an element. That's something the court may decide," he said.

JUST WATCHED Rohingya women subjected to sexual violence Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rohingya women subjected to sexual violence 03:16

Cadman, head of chambers at Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, has filed an amicus brief, along with other advocates, to the International Criminal Court to deliberate. A pre-trial chamber has to make that decision, he told CNN, and expects that announcement to come at any time.

"The ICC has jurisdiction, but again, we're looking at many many months, if not years if we see trials," Cadman said. "Slowly the wheels of international justice move, and they do move and that is the appropriate way forward."

The mission for evidence continues

In the meantime, it is imperative that human rights groups and international bodies continue to gather evidence to use should those trials ever go ahead, said Australian National University's Cecilia Jacobs.

"The fact finding mission and this report has been really crucial in building up the evidence for the prosecution, and there's nothing stopping the international community to gather (more) evidence," she said.

She blames the West's early encouragement of Myanmar's tentative outreach to the world after years of isolation as part of the reason the international community has so little sway with Myanmar now.

"I think they acted too early, and gave too many concessions before any meaningful political transition occurred, that has really left them without much leverage, and I think a lot of the behind the scenes diplomatic work that went on wasn't enough without the cooperation of the UN Security Council," she said.

The failure of the Security Council is less a criticism of the institutions supporting the UN, and more result of "the countries that interact with each other and use their prerogative to thwart action," said Connelly from the Lowy Institute.

"The failure here is in national capitals, not in Turtle Bay (home to UN headquarters in New York). The UN system has held up pretty admirably," he argues. "All those missions did their jobs and fearlessly came out with conclusions which at the time were quite shocking and they didn't hold back."
__label__politics (CNN) A list provided by the government suggests that fewer than half the migrant children younger than 5 years old who have been forcibly separated from their parents will be reunited with their families by Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said.

A court order issued June 26 set a deadline of July 10 to reunite the roughly 100 young children with their parents.

On Friday, Justice Department attorney Sarah Fabian told a court that officials might need additional time to track down dozens of parents who are no longer in custody -- including 19 who were already deported. Fabian said officials should have no problem reuniting children and the 46 parents who remain in ICE custody.

Court will reconvene on Monday.

In a media release Sunday, the ACLU said that the government had "initially provided incomplete information" by a Saturday night deadline to list the children under 5 it had forcibly separated from parents and a revised list provided Sunday gave the names of 102 children.

"It appears likely that less than half will be reunited by Tuesday's court-ordered deadline," the group said.

A July 26 deadline remains in place for the reunification of all migrant children separated from their families by the Trump administration.

"It's extremely disappointing that the Trump administration looks like it will fail to reunite even half the children under 5 with their parents. These kids have already suffered so much because of this policy, and every extra day apart just adds to that pain," Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said in the statement.

But an administration official said efforts to reunite the children are "highly encouraging."

"Consistent with the court's optimism and encouragement, the administration has worked tirelessly since Friday's status conference toward the shared goal of promptly reunifying families while ensuring the safety of the children," the administration official said.

"The results of that work have been highly encouraging, and the Department of Justice is eager to present its progress to the court on Monday and to chart a path forward to safely reunifying other families expeditiously."

Where are the parents?

Friday's hearing was the latest in an ACLU lawsuit over the administration's family separations. The case includes a broader group of thousands of other children and parents, but the hearing focused largely on the pressing deadline for children under 5.

The Justice Department attorney provided the most detailed description officials have released so far about this particular group of immigrant children who were separated from their parents. Of the roughly 100 kids, Fabian said:

• 83 kids have been linked to 86 parents.

• 16 kids have not yet been linked with parents.

• 46 of those parents remain in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

• 19 of those parents have been released from ICE custody.

• 19 of those parents have been removed from the United States.

• Two of the parents have criminal histories that will prevent officials from reuniting them with their children.

Officials have been marshaling "significant resources" as they work to comply with the court order, Fabian told the court Friday.

But she said their efficiency is hampered by requirements in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which sets out requirements officials have to follow when they release children into someone's custody.

It's one reason, she said, why officials are taking such painstaking steps to confirm parent-child relationships using methods that include DNA testing.

Gelernt took issue with the government's DNA testing , saying it should be used as "a last resort" and pointing to privacy concerns.

He argued the government does not have to follow such "lengthy, cumbersome procedures" to reunite separated families.
__label__politics (CNN) George F. Will is not the guy you'd think would be responsible for delivering the most devastating takedown of Vice President Mike Pence you will ever read.

And, yet, the conservative columnist's piece on Thursday is just that -- laying bare the total transformation of the former Indiana governor from principled conservative warrior to #1 fan of President Donald Trump.

Here's the first:

"His is the authentic voice of today's lickspittle Republican Party, he clarifies this year's elections: Vote Republican to ratify groveling as governing."

And, the second:

"Trump is what he is, a floundering, inarticulate jumble of gnawing insecurities and not-at-all compensating vanities, which is pathetic. Pence is what he has chosen to be, which is horrifying."

I told you it was brutal!

Will's penned destruction of Trump -- as only the always-use-the-$1,000-word-when-the-$1-word-would-do wordsmith can -- will draw most of the attention. But, it's a point that Will only implies about Pence that I think is the most important.

The simple fact is Pence, the day he decided to sign on as Trump's vice president, threw his lot, totally and completely, in with Trump. And, in so doing, broke with who he had been, politically speaking, up until that moment.

Let's go back in time. Pence came to prominence during his days in the House. He rocketed up through the ranks in Congress thanks to his ability to bridge the gap between social and fiscal conservatives and his telegenic presence on cable TV. He left Congress in 2012 to run for governor -- a move widely seen as laying the groundwork for a national bid.

But Pence's political future grew cloudy as chief executive of his home state -- bogged down by a massive national controversy over his decision to sign a religious freedom bill and then his backtracking on some of the provisions in it viewed as anti-gay. By 2016, Pence was facing a serious battle for a second term. His hopes of being a major player on the national stage had faded considerably.

And then Trump named him as VP.

From Pence's perspective, it all made sense. No one thought Trump would win. In the wake of that loss, Pence could effectively portray himself as a party guy, someone who signed on to a troubled ticket in hopes of rescuing it for the good of the party but ultimately couldn't do it. The Trump loss would fall entirely on Trump and his deep flaws as a candidate. Pence would emerge unscathed and, as importantly, with a massive amount of name ID and credibility with Republican activists and donors looking for a 2020 nominee to take down President Hillary Clinton.

Except Trump won. And that changed everything for Pence. The second it was clear Trump was actually going to be president, Pence grasped the fact that he was now wedded to Trump forever. And, rather than run from that characterization or try to create some healthy distance between himself and the wildly unpredictable President, Pence sprinted toward Trump and laid a massive bear hug on him. And he's never let go.

At every bill signing ceremony, Pence is there -- perched just off Trump's shoulder, smiling and nodding reassuringly. When Trump causes controversy with some impolitic comment, Pence is there to calm the jangled nerves of Republican congressional leaders and give media interviews about what Trump really meant. When Trump holds a Cabinet meeting, Pence is there to lavish praise on the boss man. ("I'm deeply humbled as your vice president to be able to be here," Pence told Trump at an end-of-the-year cabinet meeting in 2017. "Because of your leadership and because of the strong support of the leadership of the Congress, you're delivering on that middle class miracle.")

And, when Trump wants an attack dog, Pence is ready and willing -- sticking the knife in, albeit in the nicest possible way. ("I think it's time to wrap it up," Pence told NBC's Andrea Mitchell Thursday of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. "And I would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.")

Pence is all-out committed to ensuring there is never any space -- perceived or real -- between he and Trump. Trump is his meal-ticket to what he really wants -- which is the job Trump currently has. Whether Trump wins or loses re-election in 2020, Pence's only path to the Republican nomination is being seen by the Trump base as the natural heir to the President's political legacy.

Which is fine. But, as Will's column lays bare, it also represents a near-total abandonment of the principles Pence built his political career on.

Pence doesn't dine alone with women not his wife; Trump has been married three times and regularly flaunted his sexual prowess in the New York tabloids.

Pence was a committed deficit hawk in Congress; Trump has shown little concern with growing the deficit to facilitate his tax cuts and other policy proposals.

Pence is a creature of government, having been in elected office since 2001; President was the first office Trump ever ran for.

Trump is all brash New Yorker; Pence is a reserved Midwesterner.

Trump disdains the legislative process and institutional Washington; Pence was a member of House leadership.

On and on it goes. If you were picking a polar political opposite for Trump -- not just in tone but in policy emphasis as well -- you'd be hard pressed to find someone better than Pence.

None of that seems to matter to Pence, whose lingering image over the first 16 months of the Trump presidency is of a clapping, unquestioning supporter of anything and everything Trump does.

That, of course, is exactly how Pence wants you to think of him.
__label__politics (CNN) Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner on Tuesday voiced opposition to a plan to house migrant children separated from their families at the border in a private facility in his city, saying he doesn't want to be an "enabler" of the Trump administration practice.

Turner said city officials first heard last week from immigration activists that the owner of a former warehouse and homeless shelter on the edge of downtown signed a long-term lease with Southwest Key Programs , a nonprofit that runs about 26 immigrant children's shelters across Texas, Arizona and California.

Citing what he described as a moral duty to no longer be silent about the practice of separating families, Turner called on the state, which has to license the facility, the property owner and Southwest Key Programs not to move forward with the plan to house migrant children up to 17 years old in the facility.

"I do not want the city to participate in this process. I do not want our facilities and property owners to participate in this process," Turner said, joined by city, state and religious officials.

A representative for Southwest Key Programs could not be reached on Tuesday.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Interior Department moved this week to end an Obama administration ban on hunting bears in Alaska with bait, artificial light and dogs, along with other hunting practices in the state.

The proposal from the National Park Service, published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, took issue with protections for black bears, "including cubs and sows with cubs," as well as wolves and coyotes, including their pups, from "harvest practices that are otherwise permitted by the State of Alaska."

The 2015 rule now targeted by the National Park Service also prohibited using dogs to hunt black bears and using motorboats to hunt swimming caribou.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke came into office moving to expand public hunting ground from day one and issued directives last year aimed at fishing and hunting guidelines from the department.

The park service, in its proposal Tuesday, cited two of Zinke's orders, one calling on the agency to increase access to public lands for hunting and another that the park service said called on it to work with state partners, like Alaska.

__label__politics (CNN) The Supreme Court on Tuesday invalidated a provision of federal law that requires the mandatory deportation of immigrants who have been convicted of some "crimes of violence," holding that the law is unconstitutionally vague.

The case, Sessions v. Dimaya, had originated during the Obama administration but had been closely watched to see if the justices would reveal how they will consider the Trump administration's overall push to both limit immigration and increase deportations.

As expected after the oral argument, Justice Neil Gorsuch joined with the more liberal justices for the first time since joining the court to produce a 5-4 majority invalidating the federal statute. In doing so, Gorsuch was continuing the jurisprudence of Justice Antonin Scalia, who also sided with liberals when it came to the vagueness of statutes used to convict criminal defendants.

Only eight justices heard the case last term after Scalia's death, and in late June, the court announced it would re-hear arguments this term, presumably so that Gorsuch could break some kind of a tie.

President Donald Trump reacted to the ruling on Twitter on Tuesday evening, writing, "Today's Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by Congress -- House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. Keep America Safe!"

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said Sunday that he thinks about leaving the GOP "every morning."

The Nebraska senator's comment comes after he tweeted last week that he "regularly" thinks about switching to become an independent.

Sasse expanded on the thought Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union," telling anchor Jake Tapper, "I probably think about it every morning when I wake up and I figure out, why -- why am I flying away from Nebraska to go to D.C. this week? Are we going to get real stuff done?"

Sasse said he is "committed to the party of (Abraham) Lincoln and (Ronald) Reagan as long as there's a chance to reform it. But this party used to be for some pretty definable stuff. And, frankly, neither of these parties are for very much more than being anti."

Sasse, who has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, criticized the "chaos" and "reality TV circus" that he said is going on inside the White House, remarks that come amid reports of upheaval within the administration

__label__politics Story highlights Majority Leader McConnell decided not to hold a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill

They currently lack the 50 votes needed to pass the legislation

"It's obvious -- we don't have the votes right now" said Sen. Tim Scott

It's another blow to President Trump's legislative agenda

Washington (CNN) The Senate will not vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill to repeal Obamacare, Republican leaders announced Tuesday, dealing a devastating blow to President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers who tried to make a last-ditch attempt to deliver on the party's years-long campaign promise.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the decision at a lunch with fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, conceding what had become clear Monday night: They didn't have the votes.

"We haven't given up on changing the American health care system. We are not going to be able to do that this week," McConnell told reporters Tuesday. "But it still lies ahead of us, and we haven't given up on that."

Even as McConnell and his colleagues vowed that their goal of overhauling the country's health care system was far from over, Tuesday marked a clear end to the latest campaign to try to jam through a partisan bill to gut the Affordable Care Act. The budget vehicle Republicans were using to move the bill forward without any Democratic support was set to expire at the end of this week.

The sponsors of Graham-Cassidy said they were disappointed but would try again -- next time through a more transparent process. The new plan, they said, is to take another crack at health care through the 2019 budget reconciliation process (which would again only require 50 votes for passage) and hold committee hearings, markups and reach out to Democrats.
__label__world (CNN) The head of ISIS in Afghanistan, Abu Sayed Orakzai, also known as Sad Arhabi, and 10 other ISIS fighters were killed Saturday night in an airstrike in Nangarhar province, according to provincial spokesman Attaullah Khogyani.

The strike was carried out by Afghan and coalition forces after receiving intelligence from Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security, Khogyani said.

US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Lt. Col. Martin O'Donnell confirmed that the US targeted a "senior leader of a designated terrorist organization" in Afghanistan on August 25. He pointed to a statement by a spokesman for Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani that the head of ISIS -- called Daesh by the US military -- in Afghanistan was killed in the strike.

"I would also add that the United States unrelentingly continues its counterterrorism efforts against ISIS-K, Al-Qaeda, and other regional and international terrorist groups," O'Donnell said in a statement.

As ISIS has lost its foothold in Iraq and Syria, the US military substantially increased the number of airstrikes it conducted in Afghanistan, CNN reported last November. Military officials said that the success against ISIS in Iraq and Syria has freed up air assets to be used in areas like Afghanistan.

__label__politics (CNN) The past two years have been nothing short of a hellscape for Democrats.

The stunning election of Donald Trump in November 2016 has been followed by a presidency that has taken as its fundamental motivation the undoing of everything President Barack Obama accomplished -- from the Affordable Care Act to a series of clean air and clean water regulations to some sort of path toward citizenship for children brought to the United States illegally by their parents. Republicans have been broadly willing to rubber-stamp Trump — and overlook his conservative apostasies, exacerbating Democrats' angst.

But nothing has driven Democratic depression more than the fact that President Trump is now on the verge of appointing his second Supreme Court justice in less than 20 months on the job. Putting conservative Neil Gorsuch into the spot left vacant by conservative Antonin Scalia was one thing. Filling the seat of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, the widely recognized swing vote on a number of major cases in recent years, with Brett Kavanaugh, a man who came to fame due to his role in the Starr Report , was quite another.

And it was all made worse for the party -- much, much worse -- by the fact that due to a series of rule changes begun by Democrat Harry Reid when he served as Senate majority leader, every one of the 49 Democrats in the Senate could vote against Kavanaugh and he can still wind up on the bench.

With the Democratic Party largely leaderless and the 2020 presidential primary race still a long way off, one person has served as a rallying point for dispirited Democrats: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
__label__politics (CNN) Democratic House candidates dominated fundraising in the second quarter of 2018, a sign of enthusiasm among Democrats heading into November's midterm elections.

In 72 of 95 of CNN's key House races , the leading Democrat outraised the leading Republican, including at least 40 Republican incumbents.

Of 21 races CNN rated as "toss up," the most competitive designation, Democrats held the fundraising edge in 17 contests.

Democrats also had the advantage among races considered more favorable to Republicans, leading 18 of 24 races rated "lean Republican" and 17 of 28 races rated "likely Republican." And Democrats led 20 of 22 races rated "lean Democrat" or "likely Democrat."

Even Rep. Steve Stivers, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is tasked with preserving the GOP's House majority, was narrowly outraised by his Democratic challenger Rick Neal. Stivers still has a prohibitive advantage in cash banked and his race in Ohio's 15th District is rated by CNN as solid Republican.

Many Republicans faced significant second quarter fundraising deficits in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

In California in particular, after a slate of competitive primaries in early June, a wave of newly minted Democratic nominees consolidated resources and appear to pose a formidable threat to multiple GOP incumbents.

Republican Rep. Steve Knight (CA-25) saw his second quarter haul nearly tripled by Democratic challenger Katie Hill. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (CA-48) was outraised nearly 5-to-1 by Democrat Harley Rouda. And Democrat Josh Harder took in nearly half a million more than Rep. Jeff Denham (CA-10). Still, Knight and Denham maintained considerable advantages in cash-on-hand, while Rohrabacher and Rouda emerged almost tied.

It's a similar story in Texas, where Republican Reps. John Culberson (TX-07), Will Hurd (TX-23), Pete Sessions (TX-32) and John Carter (TX-31) were all outraised by their leading Democratic challenger, though each incumbent still had more banked at the end of the quarter. Democrat MJ Hegar, who emerged from a May run-off to face Rep. Carter, posted one of the strongest fundraising hauls of the period on the heels of a viral biographical video, raising $1.17 million compared to just over $266,000 for Rep. Carter.

Hegar was one of 20 non-incumbent Democrats in CNN's key races that raised over $1 million for their House bids in the second quarter alone. Among the other top Democratic fundraisers: Amy McGrath in KY-06, who raised over $1.2 million; Gina Ortiz Jones in TX-23, who raised over $1.2 million; Mikie Sherrill in NJ-11, who took in over $1.8 million; Katie Hill, who raised $1.3 million; Jason Crow in CO-06, who took in over $1 million; Tom Malinowski in NJ-07, who raised over $1.3 million; and Randy Bryce, running for retiring Speaker Paul Ryan's seat in WI-01, who raised over $1.2 million.

Two other high-profile Republican incumbents facing tough re-elections -- Rep. Carlos Curbelo (FL-26) and Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10) -- edged their leading Democratic challenger in second quarter fundraising.

And most Republican incumbents retained the advantage in money banked for the rest of the cycle despite large gains made by their Democratic opponents.

However, GOP Rep. Mike Bishop (MI-08), who saw his second quarter haul more than doubled by Elissa Slotkin, fell further behind in cash on hand. And Rep. Leonard Lance (NJ-07) now trails Malinowski by nearly half a million in the bank after his Democratic challenger's big quarter.

Lance was one of a few New Jersey Republicans who saw their Democratic challenger post strong second quarter fundraising totals. In NJ-03, Democrat Andy Kim nearly doubled Rep. Tom MacArthur's haul and even took a lead in cash on hand of nearly half a million dollars. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05) -- a first-term Democratic incumbent in a race rated "likely Democrat" -- outraised his Republican challenger by nearly 6-to-1, and has over $4.5 million banked.

In Utah's 4th District, incumbent GOP Rep. Mia Love reversed the trend, posting a strong second quarter with over $1 million raised, though she narrowly trails her Democratic challenger, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, in cash on hand.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee celebrated the second quarter fundraising totals in a release Tuesday, saying over 70 Democratic challengers had outraised their Republican opponent in the second quarter (including races rated as uncompetitive by CNN).

"Democrats have the infrastructure and message to capitalize on a historic surge of grassroots energy by raising record amounts from small-dollar, online contributions. There's no question that Democrats are charging into the general elections with all the momentum, said DCCC spokesperson Tyler Law.

The NRCC spoke to their candidates' significant cash advantages in a statement. "Democrats in moderate, competitive districts have spent the majority of their money highlighting their progressive bona fides. Meanwhile, Republicans have continued to pad their campaign coffers and are well positioned to execute effective campaigns this fall," said NRCC national press secretary Jesse Hunt.
__label__world Seoul, South Korea (CNN) The leaders of North and South Korea will hold a summit in Pyongyang in September, both countries announced Monday.

It will be the third in-person meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The two first met in April, pledging to forge closer relations and work to formally end the Korean War in an agreement called the Panmunjom Declaration

They then held an impromptu meeting in May at the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas.

Representatives from the two Koreas announced the September meeting after a round of high-level talks between officials from Pyongyang and Seoul at the DMZ Monday.

Ri Son Gwon, North Korea's point man for inter-Korean relations, told reporters that the date has been set, but would not confirm exactly when in September the meeting would be held.

"What's very important is that both governments do all they ought to do regarding progressing all the issues on the agenda," Ri said.

"If the issues that were raised in the inter-Korea talks and individual meetings are not resolved, then unexpected problems could arise and all the items on the agenda could meet obstacles."

However, Cho Myoung-gyon -- Ri's South Korean counterpart -- appeared to dispute that both sides have settled on a specific date, telling reporters that "it needs to be discussed further."

Kim Eui-keum, a spokesman for Moon, said that holding the summit before September 10 would be difficult due to logistics.

When he does go, Moon will be the third South Korean president to travel to the North Korean capital, and the first in more than a decade.

South Korean President Kim Dae-jung met Kim Jong Un's father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, in Pyongyang in 2000 for the first inter-Korean summit. Former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun also met Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2007.

The Winter Olympics thaw

Moon has long been an advocate for greater engagement with North Korea, dating back to his days as a key presidential aide in the 2000s.

He is credited with using this year's Winter Olympics to help warm relations between Pyongyang and the rest of the world after a tense 2017 marked by North Korea's repeated weapons tests.

The detente paved the way for the April inter-Korean summit and US President Donald Trump's meeting with Kim in Singapore in June -- the first ever between sitting leaders of North Korea and the United States.

Kim and Trump both agreed to "build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula," while the North Korean leader "reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

Critics of the agreement argued the Trump administration failed to get Kim to agree to specific action.

Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have preached patience since then, arguing that complex nuclear negotiations take time. Pompeo has been quick to note North Korea has not tested any weapons since November, when it fired a long-range ballistic missile experts believe could be capable of hitting the United States with a nuclear warhead.

But the two sides appear to have hit an impasse.

Senior diplomatic sources told CNN last week that Pyongyang has continually rejected Washington's proposals on denuclearization, calling them "gangster-like."

Cho, the South Korean reunification minister, said North and South Korea discussed denuclearization in general terms during their talks Monday.

"We explained that we need to help North Korea-US talks progress quickly and that there needs to be an establishment of dynamic where the inter-Korean relationship and the North Korea-US relationship improves in cycles," he said.

London (CNN) The American actress Meghan Markle has confirmed that her father, Thomas Markle, will not attend her wedding to Britain's Prince Harry on Saturday.

Her statement ends days of speculation over the 73-year-old's health, and a controversy over whether he staged a series of paparazzi-style photographs.

"Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health," Meghan Markle said in a statement provided by Kensington Palace Thursday.

"I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday."

The statement is the first official confirmation that Thomas Markle would not be able to walk his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) One of the White House's most important diplomats happens to be an artist -- with a top secret security clearance.

That means the chief White House calligrapher now has greater access to sensitive information than White House adviser -- and President Donald Trump's son-in-law -- Jared Kushner.

Scrutiny over White House clearances in recent weeks has raised questions about top secret versus secret clearance , the application process and the levels of access afforded to those who achieve it.

Kushner was among those White House officials whose security clearance was downgraded from top secret to secret, a significant move cutting back on the information he can access.

But even though Kushner recently lost the level of clearance to know sources and methods , the size of the population with top secret clearances is actually quite large. A 2015 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence pegged the total at 2,885,570 people for confidential and secret clearances and 1,363,483 for top secret clearances.

According to information obtained by CNN from a US government official as of November 2017, among those with top secret clearance is White House chief calligrapher Patricia Blair.

The calligrapher's office plays a key role in White House diplomacy. The East Wing, which oversees the calligrapher's office, declined to comment on the role of the chief calligrapher or why a top secret clearance is necessary.

But former chief calligrapher Rick Paulus, who served in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and had a top secret clearance himself, attributed the need for it due to the knowledge of the President's schedule, as well as the calligrapher's proximity to world leaders. When he was a White House calligrapher, Paulus told CNN, he "never, ever dealt with intelligence matters."

The calligrapher's office: History and function

Rick Paulus, the former chief calligrapher at the White House.

The office of the calligrapher began informally in the 1860s when first lady Mary Todd Lincoln delegated the task of writing White House invitations to a staff member, a position that eventually needed an entire staff, according to Matt Costello, a senior historian at the White House Historical Association.

In 1977, Rosalynn Carter formally established the Office of the First Lady, the calligrapher's office falling under the East Wing's social secretary.

As the US emerged as a global economic power beginning in the 1940s, Costello said, there was a "drastic increase" in state dinners at the White House. Those dinners, which included between 140 and 200 people, required handwritten invitations, envelopes, menus and place cards.

The calligrapher's function is intertwined with US diplomacy as the US hosts heads of state, demonstrating that the US is committed to working with or wants to improve relations with other countries.

Ahead of a state dinner, Paulus would delve into the history of the hosted country, its symbols, and its fonts, which calligraphers call "hands" throughout time.

"As calligraphers, we feel like we're playing an integral role. The invitation sets the stage for the whole event. Calligraphers are helping, simply, to set the stage for diplomacy," the former chief calligrapher said.

"Whatever happens, whatever conflicts they have, if you see your name beautifully written on a placard, your nation's flag on a menu, you can't help to soften up a bit," he said. "Protocol is about human interactions, and as calligraphers, it's our job to introduce creativity and beauty."

The sheer volume the office produces is extremely high and gets especially busy during the holiday season. One December alone, Paulus calculated that his office hand addressed 19,000 envelopes.

Over the years, first ladies have taken various levels of interest in the office.

"Hillary Clinton was mostly hands off altogether. Laura Bush was very, very hands on to the point that she'd get into letter styles and looking closely at things," Paulus said of his time.

It's clear that the Trumps, who know the hospitality industry intimately, value the calligraphers; First lady Melania Trump has posted multiple images on her social media accounts highlighting their work.

The office is also responsible for special documents from the President, such as certificates.

This Valentine's Day, the first lady teamed up with the calligraphers to design a special White House valentine, which she distributed during a visit to a children's hospital in Cincinnati.

The calligraphers keep a low profile with rare media access. Martha Stewart featured the office ahead of a state dinner with Prime Minister Tony Blair in November 2000, and C-SPAN took a tour while the calligraphers prepared invitations for a state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II in 2008.

Changes to the office

While the number of calligraphers in the office has ranged as high as eight at the beginning of the Carter administration, there are currently three full-time calligraphers in the office, including the chief calligrapher. Calligraphers Debra Brown and Becky Larimer do not have security clearances, per the data. White House salary disclosure data indicates that Blair made $102,212 in 2017, with Brown at $90,828 and Larimer at $70,100.

There has been change throughout the years at the office -- for instance, Paulus ushered Macintosh computers into the office in 1998. The deadlines have gotten shorter and aspects of the work has been taken into the digital era. Design and style has also changed over the years.

"I think there's a general misconception that things have been forever unchanging, but the calligrapher's office is one of the places that has changed with the times," Costello said.
__label__world The first homegrown female Emirati superhero, Emara is gaining attention around the world. By day, she's a typical teenage girl named Moza. By night, her fearless alter ego fights crime on the teeming streets of the United Arab Emirates.

Abu Dhabi-based Fatma Almheiri was just 21 when she created the mini-series on YouTube in 2016. "Emara" now boasts over 75,000 subscribers.

Almheiri says that throughout her childhood she couldn't relate to the characters she saw on television. "Emara is the superhero I wanted growing up, that I didn't get to have. This is me putting it out to the younger generation."

Although Almheiri does not wear a headscarf, Emara -- and some of the show's other characters -- do. "I wanted Emara to dress modestly because ... there are no hijabi main characters [in the superhero world]," says Almheiri.

Fatma Almheiri at work.

Emara joins two female Muslim superheroes -- Latifa , from Saudi Arabia, and Ms. Marvel , a Pakistani American -- to challenge negative stereotypes.

Almheiri decided to create her own supergirl while in the United States, where she encountered many false assumptions about Muslim-Arab women. She was frequently asked why she wasn't wearing the niqab (a veil that covers the entire face, except for the eyes) and would explain that although some women choose to express themselves in this way, it is not required by law.

"I think the rest of the world needs to see proper representations of us [Arabs] because ... there's a big percentage of them that completely misunderstand us or our culture," she says. "I can't blame them because we're not really in their media. We're not in their cartoons."

Almheiri's aim is to create interesting stories that subtly highlight aspects of Emirati culture, peopled by dynamic characters with Islamic and Arab attributes.

"There are little bits and pieces of how life is here [in the UAE] and it's chill. It's not how they think it is which is, that ... everybody has to be in a niqab. You're not allowed to leave your house. You can't drive."

Fatma Almheiri's sketches of Emara.

To reach a wider audience, Almheiri has Emara voiced in English, formal Arabic and the Emirati dialect. Perhaps surprisingly, the majority of viewers are in the United States, followed by South America, Spain and Saudi Arabia.

Almheiri says she often receives messages from Muslim and Arab girls thanking her for creating a character they can relate to.

"I've been in their situation looking for something like that in the shows I watch, in the cartoons I watch," she says. "So to be able to give that to someone else and having somebody go out of their way to thank you for it, is indescribable."

__label__politics Sioux Falls, South Dakota (CNN) A man who had a close relationship with suspected Russian spy Maria Butina is a charming political operative who left a trail of aggrieved former business partners complaining that he owed them money, according to court records and interviews in his home state of South Dakota.

The emerging profile of Paul Allen Erickson, Butina's alleged one-time boyfriend, comes from CNN interviews with a neighbor, a former friend, political acquaintances and his one-time lawyer — along with details contained in half a dozen lawsuits filed in local courts near Sioux Falls.

And news this week of Butina's arrest by federal authorities has longtime friends in this usually quiet part of the American homeland wondering what brought the alleged Russian spy and the small-time Midwestern businessman together.

On Friday, CNN visited Erickson's apartment. He did not answer calls to his cell phone or knocks on his apartment unit's door. His dusty 1992 Ford Mustang remained parked in the garage beneath the building. The license plate reads "RTWING."

Erickson has not been identified by prosecutors by name or charged with any wrongdoing, but his activities match those described in court filings as "US Person 1," who authorities allege "was instrumental in aiding her covert influence operation, despite knowing its connections to Russian Officials."

CNN spoke to eight people who crossed paths with Erickson, some going back 40 years. Those who knew him for years say that Erickson had a powerful presence and a convincing tone. By the accounts of those who knew him, he was an intelligent man with an ability to make you trust him. But, according to court records, some of his former partners sued him after feeling lured into what they claimed were false investments, and judges repeatedly ordered him to pay them back.

He and his companies were repeatedly sued for allegedly failing to pay back loans. Erickson was accused of duping a father-son business duo into handing him $30,000 for a company Erickson described in a letter as one that promised stellar investment returns of up to 75% per year for what he claimed was a high-tech patent for a wheelchair. CNN could not find any trace of such patents under his name. Erickson eventually admitted in court documents to owing them their unpaid investment.

Erickson also admitted in court documents to racking up $37,000 in debt on a Platinum Delta SkyMiles credit card in 2013; he was sued two years later by American Express Bank for the entire amount.

Erickson was also twice accused of failing to pay his own lawyers, two of whom ditched him during the course of defending him in a single case because he would not fulfill his obligations, according to court documents. His first lawyer in the case, Terry Wieczorek, sat down with CNN and said he had little interaction with Erickson but acknowledged his former client's reluctance to pay for his services. Erickson's next lawyer on the case, Eric Kerkvliet, did not return CNN's calls, but court documents cited a "communication breakdown" with Erickson.

The same charisma he apparently displayed to those in his business life carried over to his personal interactions at his Sioux Falls apartment complex.

Around the building, Erickson was known for his oozing charisma and his impressive physical stature, as well as his tendency to be a warm conversation starter. He would sometimes cook food or bake brownies that he would share with his neighbors.

At the apartment complex he's been living and working from for 20 years, a longtime friend who moved near him five years ago told CNN that Erickson would introduce others to Butina as his "friend." They mingled with neighbors at a 2015 Halloween party in the building. But the couple would stay at the apartment infrequently. They would sometimes go months without appearing at the building -- then return and stay for a few days. Erickson had to rely on a neighbor to pick up his deliveries of The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and a local newspaper.

Butina was often seen in athletic clothing, and she frequently ran on the treadmill at the apartment complex gym. The neighbor who spoke to CNN, who wished to remain unnamed, said Butina would sometimes express a desire to go back to Russia.

In late 2016, the neighbor said Erickson claimed that he worked directly with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. When teased about Cabinet picks, Erickson would shoot back: "Well, you should have seen the others we were looking at."

Bruce Danielson, a local resident heavily involved in local politics, said Erickson's "whole life is connections. He would work a room, like nobody could. Just to make the connections needed to make sure everybody knew he was there."

"Paul always gravitated towards where power was at," Danielson said.

Sioux Falls coffee shop owner Steve Hildebrand, a Democrat, remembered working opposite of Erickson during a 2004 US Senate race in South Dakota. He described Erickson as the "negative research guy" supporting challenger John Thune, who won and remains in office.

Hildebrand was not surprised Erickson is now dealing with accusations of mixing with a Russian spy.

"He wanted to have powerful relationships. He wants to be cozy with these people," Hildebrand told CNN on Friday.

As Erickson bragged about his political prowess in South Dakota, he was quickly burning bridges in Washington. He served for a brief tenure on the board of the American Conservative Union, which organizes a large annual gathering of conservative activists and politicians called the Conservative Political Action Conference.

But Erickson was removed from the board in 2014. By 2015, he was no longer welcome at the annual conference.

"He was removed from the board. The board also decided it would be best if Paul no longer attended CPAC," said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. "He was removed for cause and that's all I can say about that."

Political operatives who dealt with him in recent years said he was something of a gadfly, always trying to get in with GOP presidential campaigns and transition team efforts. A person familiar with the situation said Erickson's efforts to join the Trump transition team were rebuffed.

Erickson's ties to well-known political figures stretch back decades. He helped arrange a speaking engagement featuring Oliver North 2002 at what is now known as Augustana University, according to Nebraska lawyer Charles B. Garman, who knew him in college. North was known for his role in the 1980s Iran-Contra affair, in which the United States illegally supplied weapons to support right-wing rebel groups in Nicaragua. Earlier this year, North was named president of the National Rifle Association, which Butina has been accused of trying to infiltrate.
__label__world (CNN) A 3-year-old boy and his 1-year-old brother were on their own -- possibly for as many as four days -- after surviving a single-vehicle crash that killed their mother in south Arkansas.

The older of the two boys was found Monday morning after authorities received a 911 call about a boy who was seen walking by himself in a rural area on a state highway near Camden, Arkansas, Ouachita County Detective Nathan Greeley told CNN.

The boy was covered in cuts and scrapes and appeared to have been outside for an extended period, Greeley said.

"You could tell he was extremely traumatized," Greeley said.

The 3-year-old boy who, along with his 1-year-old brother, survived a car crash that killed their mother in south Arkansas.

Officials gave the boy a bath, food and a change of clothes and distributed a description of him. A family member contacted the sheriff's office and told authorities that the boy's 1-year-old brother was likely nearby, Greeley said. The relative also said the children's mother had not been seen since going grocery shopping on Thursday.

__label__politics (CNN) Donald Trump's legal team is trying to narrow the scope of the President's potential interview with special counsel Robert Mueller to questions on Russia-related matters that occurred before Trump's election, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.

Trump's lawyers, who are urging Mueller to wrap up his investigation, are looking for a way to get him to agree to limit -- or eliminate -- questions regarding Trump's conduct after he won the presidency, especially those related to whether he might have obstructed justice while in office.

Their goal is to move past a standoff that threatens to drag out Mueller's investigation, and appears to be part of a larger strategy to negotiate with the special counsel through the media. Ultimately, their success depends on Mueller's willingness to cut a deal -- and there is no indication so far that he'd be open to any such proposal.

"We said we wanted the questions limited to Russian collusion," one of the sources with knowledge of the President's legal strategy tells CNN. Since that aspect of the investigation deals with the Trump campaign and transition team's interactions with Russians, it would exclude questions about Trump's actions once in office. And even within the pre-presidency category, Trump's lawyers want to narrow what questions the prosecutors can ask.

The focus on Trump's conduct prior to assuming the presidency also would exclude questions about the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey and possible obstruction of justice.

__label__world (CNN) The summer of temperature extremes just keeps going, with record heat waves this month on all four continents that occupy the non-tropical Northern Hemisphere where it is now summer.

On Monday, Japan recorded a temperature never before reached on the island nation since reliable records began in the 1800s.

Kumagaya, a city only 40 miles from Tokyo, hit 41.1 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit) in the midst of a multiweek heat wave that has killed at least 44 people.

The extreme temperatures are also affecting other countries in East Asia: South and North Korea have set heat records with temperatures climbing near 40 C (104 F).

It is these types of heat waves that scientists have been warning would be a consequence of warming the planet through greenhouse gas emissions.

"The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle," said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University.

"We are seeing them play out in real time in the form of unprecedented heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires. And we've seen them all this summer," he said.

Temperatures soar in Europe and Arctic

Much of Europe has been baking under a massive high-pressure ridge that is allowing tropical heat to climb all the way to the Arctic and blocking cooling rainfalls from ending the stretch of hot weather.

Temperatures above 32 C extended to the northern reaches of Scandinavia , setting records in Sweden, Finland and Norway for stations above the Arctic Circle.

The result has been a string of unprecedented wildfires in Sweden that have prompted the country to request assistance from other nations such as Italy, with more resources to fight wildfires.

21 C in 1976. The United Kingdom is off to its driest start to a summer , according to the Met Office, and it has been one of the hottest on record, coming in just 0.1 C behind the average temperature during the hottest summer on record in the UK, which averaged21 Cin 1976.

The heat wave is ongoing , with a "level three heat-health watch" issued for much of south and east England through this week as temperatures will climb in to the 30s Celsius through Friday.

Temperatures compared to normal, with red/orange showing temperatures well above average for much of the Northern Hemisphere.

In Northern Africa's Sahara Desert, certainly no stranger to sweltering temperatures, a record high was recorded July 5 in Ouargla, Algeria. The mark of 51.3 C (124 F) is the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on the African continent, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

Numerous heat waves in North America

This month, a brutal heat wave also struck Canada, which saw temperatures peak in Montreal on July 2 with a record of 36.6 C (98 F). There were at least 70 heat-related deaths across the province of Quebec; CNN's news partner CBC reported that the number of deaths overwhelmed Montreal's morgue

In the United States, July heat waves have stretched from the highly populated Northeast to the desert Southwest.

An exceptional stretch of heat in Dallas-Fort Worth has brought four consecutive days with record highs, hitting 108 or 109 F each day (42 to 43 C).

July has seen 41 heat records set across the United States -- but zero record minimums.

This lopsided tally has become the norm, as climate change has tipped the scales so far in the direction of warmer temperatures.

This is climate change

"Cold and hot, wet and dry -- we experience natural weather conditions all the time," said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University.

"But today, climate change is loading the dice against us, making certain types of extremes, such as heat waves and heavy rain events, much more frequent and more intense than they used to be," Hayhoe said.

Remember the series of brutal nor'easter snowstorms that hit New England during a particularly cold stretch in late winter and early spring? The frequent bouts of snow and ice had many people wondering, "what happened to global warming?"

We are experiencing the coldest weather in more than two decades-most people never remember anything like this. GLOBAL WARMING anyone? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2014

Well, here it is. And this is what it looks like. Although it will still get cold during the winter and there will be colder-than-normal spells from time to time, the heat will return, and summers are getting hotter.

2018 is the hottest La Niña year on record (the cooling of the ocean waters in the Pacific during La Niña tends to cool the planet), according to the World Meteorological Association, and with La Niña fading away and El Niño (which warms the Pacific Ocean) likely to take its place, things are only going to get hotter.
__label__politics (CNN) Over the weekend, Democrats made what they wanted you to believe was a Very Big Change. In the wake of the 2016 Democratic primary fight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic National Committee prohibited superdelegates -- elected officials and party leaders -- from voting on the first ballot at the party's convention if none of the candidates have received a majority of pledged delegates. Which is less than revolutionary.

We chatted -- via email -- about the DNC's move, the momentum factor and what it all means for 2020. Our conversation, lightly edited for grammar and spelling (because Chris is a terrible typer) is below.

Chris Cillizza: Harry!

Superdelegates are gone! Our long national nightmare is over! Bernie Sanders is president! Wait, what's that you say?

OK, on a serious note, the Democratic National Committee did significantly alter the way in which superdelegates -- the éminence grise of the Democratic Party -- factor into the nominating process over the weekend. Superdelegates are no longer able to vote on the first ballot at the party's nominating convention unless one of the candidates has already secured a majority of the pledged delegates through the primary process. Which means, in real terms, that superdelegates can't hand the nomination to someone who hasn't won it outright through actual votes.

The changes also mean that a candidate can't count superdelegate supporters as part of his or her overall delegate count as the primary process plays out -- a major gripe of the Sanders' folks related to how Clinton used her massive superdelegate edge to portray herself as all-but-inevitable from the start of the process.

Soo........do these changes actually change all that much? Should the Sanders people celebrate?

Harry Enten: Shalom Christoph(er),

You know I do enjoy a little make-believe, but it's important to know when we're in the real world ... and when we're in fantasyland.

It is 100% true that Clinton jumped out to a huge lead in endorsements, and therefore superdelegates, in 2016. The question is whether that made too much of a difference in the outcome of the primary. Yes, it's true that endorsements tend to be correlated with primary outcomes, though, as Donald Trump taught us, history doesn't always hold.

But the question is, were people watching the superdelegate counts and thereby deciding on Clinton? I'd argue that they probably weren't. Remember, Clinton had a large superdelegate lead in 2008 as well. Ultimately, though, it didn't affect the outcome. Barack Obama ultimately came from behind and beat Clinton in pledged delegates, and the superdelegates followed in his direction.

This brings me to the key point: pledged delegates decided 2016 like they did 2008. Clinton got more votes than Sanders and won the nomination that way.

How does not allowing superdelegates to vote on the first ballot ultimately change very much? They can still endorse and influence the primary that way. They can still vote on the second ballot and influence the result that way.

Did you know that superdelegates, because they aren't pledged, can change their mind?

Do I sound skeptical?

- Harry

Cillizza: This felt like an olive twig rather than an olive branch to the Sanders people when I first read of the deal -- and, having read your thoughts, it feels even more like one.

It seems to me that the DNC knew it had a major problem with the Sanders wing of the party in the last election -- as symbolized by the fact that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was run off as Democratic National Committee chair in the opening moments of the 2016 convention because of emailed released by WikiLeaks that showed her with a clear thumb on the scale for Clinton.

Given that outrage, the DNC had to do something to show a) they were listening and b) Sanders' fight hadn't been in vain. So, they came up with this idea of no superdelegates on the first ballot. Which feels to me like a gesture as opposed to a significant change.

BUT, let me play devils' advocate for a minute on your contention that people weren't watching superdelegate counts as they were deciding who to vote for in the 2016 primaries. I agree that the average Democratic voter didn't go into the voting booth with the updated superdelegate counts on their mind. But I do think that the superdelegate counts did add to a sense of inevitability for Clinton, the sense that no matter what Sanders did, he was never going to catch her. That she was the nominee. Full stop.

Human nature being what it is, I could see how people who might have been on the fence about Sanders decided not to vote for him because they didn't think he could win and/or they wanted to be able to tell their friends they voted for the winner. We all like winners, right Harry?

Enten: Perhaps, we can now go to my NYC haunt the : Perhaps, we can now go to my NYC haunt the Olive Tree to discuss olive branches versus olive twigs.

Oh, I definitely agree on the divide. That convention was ugly, if you remember.

Now, I think you bring up an interesting question. Yes, we know that there are momentum effects in primaries . People do seem to get aboard a winning train. So I am sympathetic to that argument.

I'd argue the big problem, again, is that Sanders simply couldn't win over black voters in the south. Sanders' bid was all but done when he lost the South Carolina primary to Clinton. Now, she was aided by an endorsement from Rep. Jim Clyburn, but were people caring about that endorsement because he had a superdelegate vote? Or were people caring about that because he was a longtime representative whose voice they trusted?

Let me ask you this ... if people like winners, then why are the New York Yankees the most hated team in baseball

Cillizza: We should go to my NYC haunt: The Olive Garden. You can't get unlimited breadsticks just anywhere!!

I agree that Sanders didn't lose the nomination because of Clinton's superdelegate lead. He lost because he could never broaden his coalition or seriously challenge her for hers. I also think the Democratic Party, writ large, needed to find a way to make peace with the Sanders people and viewed this superdelegate change as a way to do it -- even if, as we agree, there isn't much to the changes.

Let's look forward. Given how GIANT we expect the field to be in 2020, is there a chance we are talking about a scenario where no one gets a majority of pledged delegates on the first ballot and superdelegates decide the outcome?

Enten: You gotta love the : You gotta love the Olive Garden commercials

I think now you're asking the correct question. What does the superdelegate change mean going forward? Well, no news network is going to show anyone with a large delegate lead before any votes are cast. Yet, I tend to doubt that would make a difference in 2020 because there is no obvious next in line. I think many lawmakers would have been careful in endorsing too early anyway because of the perception of 2016.

What I have learned more generally speaking over the last few years is that in politics, we're dealing with small sample sizes. Yes, we can make educated guesses about where things are going, but just because something hasn't happened in a long time doesn't mean it can't in the near future.

It seems to me that because so many people are running that the chance for a contested convention are higher than normal. The Democrats also have proportional delegate rules that heighten the chance of that occurring. The key question is whether you can get three or four strong candidates. There's that 15% threshold in Democratic primaries, so someone winning 45% of the vote with a slew of people in the teens probably doesn't work for those who want a contested convention.

And that's the beauty of this rule, if you're a longtime DNC member who likes superdelegates. Their limited power in round one may be gone, but they maintain it in round two when it would have mattered the most anyway. They've done so for a cycle where the chance of a contested convention is higher than normal.

Still, I should say it is small chance, most likely. If it were to occur, I wonder what those who wanted to get rid of them will think of the new rule change ...
__label__world Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) The initial relief that greeted the dramatic discovery of the trapped Thai soccer team has given way to questions over why the boys are still inside the flooded cave network and not on their way to the surface and their waiting families.

Part of the concern about attempting to bring the boys out of the cramped, pitch-black chamber where they have spent the better part of nine days is that they are around two kilometers (1.2 miles) inside the cave, and nearly a kilometer below the surface, according to rescuers.

The boys, who were found alive by British divers in the early hours of Monday morning, are now being tended to by seven Thai Navy Seals, including a doctor and nurse, Thai Navy Seal Chief Rear Adm. Aphakorn Yoo-kongkaew told reporters at a news conference late Tuesday.

"Now we have given food to the boys, starting with food that is easy to digest and provides high energy," he said. "We have taken care of those boys following the doctor's recommendation. So do not worry, we will take care of them with our best. We will bring all of them with safety. We are now planning how to do so."

The children were being given access to telephone lines to be able to reach their families, but the focus, said Yoo-kongkaew, was on building their strength so they can attempt the journey out.

__label__world The quaint houses that line spotless streets and the humble boats moored in the marina are the embodiment of "lagom," the Swedish concept of not too much, not too little, but just right.

But while this seaside town, with a population of just 9,000, may seem idyllic, it is also a stronghold of the Sweden Democrats -- the far-right, anti-immigrant party that has rocked the country's politics and national identity -- and the hometown of its 39-year-old leader Jimmie Akesson.

On Sunday, when Swedes vote in the national election, the Sweden Democrats may become the second-biggest party , a move that would see the party grow closer in popularity to the center-left Social Democrats -- the architects of the welfare state and who have come in first in every national election since 1917.

In this respect, Sweden is not unusual. From Italy to Poland and Germany, many countries have seen political gains by the far right, while extremists in the US and UK have become more vocal.

But the significance of the far-right party potentially joining a coalition government in one of Europe's most liberal and welcoming nations, and the potential for contagion in the rest of the European Union, has sparked alarm. French President Emmanuel Macron this week criticized Akesson's views as "incompatible" with Swedish values.

The predicted far-right surge in Sweden has sparked protests across the country.

Fears about migration

Like many other nations that have seen a rise of the far right, Sweden's political earthquake has been sparked by the issue of immigration.

Traditionally one of the most welcoming countries to refugees, Sweden took in 162,450 asylum seekers in 2015 -- the second-largest number of migrants per capita of any EU country.

Many Swedes were initially welcoming. But others feared the welfare system, and Swedish values, would collapse under the weight of so many immigrants.

"In 2015, it was chaos here. And it's still chaos," said Rolf Hans Berg, an 83-year-old Sweden Democrat supporter who lives in Solvesborg. "Today we give homes to those [refugees] coming here. Of course, that frustrates Swedes. It's a big problem. It's them against us, more or less."

Since the refugee crisis, the number of asylum claims has fallen precipitously. Still, many of those opposed to migration have turned to the Sweden Democrats, lured by its anti-immigrant, nativist stances.

Organized crime in Swedish cities, the 2017 terror attack in Stockholm and recent car burnings have added to the climate of fear.

"We had this terror attack in Stockholm last year and then a lot of people started talking because [the suspect's] asylum claim had been rejected," said Matilda Karnerup, a 23-year-old student from Solvesborg, adding that while she is undecided about whom to vote for, she sympathizes with the Sweden Democrats.

Police separate demonstrators in Stockholm in November 2016 after a protest against migrants.

Contested story

Despite overall crime staying relatively stable since 2008 (measured by the total amount of reported offenses per capita) social media has amplified -- and at times distorted -- this narrative of a crime-ridden Sweden. Research carried out by Oxford University's Internet Institute found one in three news articles shared on Twitter ahead of this weekend's election was "junk news," which it defined as "misleading, deceptive or incorrect information."

With low levels of inequality, unemployment and crime, as well as a booming economy, Sweden is, by many measures, doing well compared to many other European countries.

Integration has long been a talking point among all parties, but the debate has become noisier in recent years with the influx of refugees.

Many voters see the extreme racial stratification of city areas -- such as the outlying areas of Gothenburg and Stockholm -- as problematic. But Anders Hellstrom, a senior lecturer in political science and expert on the Sweden Democrats at Malmo University, says this is more about segregation than integration, issues that stand in opposition to each other.

Refugees in Sweden are worse off in the short term compared to other OECD countries, said Pieter Bevelander, a professor of international migration and ethnic relations at the Malmo University. Overall though, Sweden's integration policies have been successful , according to the Migrant Integration Policy Index. About 70% of non-EU refugees have employment after 10 years, Bevelander added, and thanks to a booming economy he expects this to continue unchanged.

In Solvesborg, this discrepancy between truth and perception is apparent too, and reflected in the hotly contested versions of Akesson's early years in the town.

Among his supporters, Akesson is well regarded for seeming like a normal guy and standing by his hardline stance on immigration through the years, however controversial his ideas may once have been. That more of Sweden's political parties are adopting harder stances on migration only reinforces his support. Those who have debated him also recognize his rhetorical shrewdness.

Helene Bjorklund, the mayor of Solvesborg and a Social Democrat, suggests that because Sweden has so few problems, migration receives most attention.

Yet, Akesson's murky past, the strong presence of neo-Nazism in the earlier iteration of the Sweden Democrats, and his contact with neo-Nazis and skinheads when he first joined the party continue to dog the candidate.

On various occasions, Akesson has been confronted in the media, including the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet , by Solvesborg citizens who grew up with him and recall his association with neo-Nazi elements.

In different interviews Akesson has claimed that when he was growing up in the 80s in Solvesborg he was harassed by gangs of migrant kids, who threatened him with various weapons and spat at him calling him a, "F***ing Swede."

Yet, various individuals CNN spoke to, who are from Solvesborg and knew Akesson, doubt the truth of those claims.

Per Nilsson, an august prize-winning author and a former teacher at one of the schools Akesson attended in Solvesborg during those years, is one such person.

"When he started school, there were no immigrants in this town. Everyone knew what he said wasn't true," Nilsson told CNN.

Akesson declined a request to be interviewed by CNN before the election. However, in past interviews he has consistently defended his version of the truth, claiming that he "subjectively experienced it like that."

These experiences, he says, minted his political views as an adult , views that he would carry with him as he shaped the current version of the Sweden Democrats.

Louise Erixon, leader of the Sweden Democrats in Solvesborg and Akesson's fiance, says a feeling of insecurity has spread across the country.

All issues point to immigration

Immigration is only one of the big issues in the election for many voters. Healthcare and the environment -- sparked by a recent spate of fires that swept across the country -- also weigh heavily.

Many Sweden Democrat supporters, especially from rural areas, feel they have been ignored by Stockholm's political elite, which has contributed to the debate on inequality, according to Hellstrom.

And while the Sweden Democrats are not a single-issue party, he said, "they embark from a nativist anti-immigrant platform," relating all these issues back to immigration.

By tying all these issues into a coherent narrative that relates directly to immigration, Akesson and the Sweden Democrats have changed the debate, forcing a shift among all parties to the right.

"What is acceptable to say in a news column or what a politician can say has become more extreme. The normal state of affairs has become more extreme," said Hellstrom.

The Sweden Democrats have proposed various measures around migration and integration. To better assimilate migrants to Swedish culture, the Sweden Democrats propose to curtail the ability of certain ethnicities to practice their culture

The Sweden Democrats also intend to give migrants coupons instead of money to purchase basic goods, and they aim to put a stop to the provision of free healthcare for undocumented immigrants

Is Sweden a success story or modern dystopia?

Regardless of Sweden's affluence, the Sweden Democrats see Sweden heading down the road to "dystopia," according to Hellstrom, which has many people begging the question: Why?

"People have been affected by immigration policies. And the immigration policies affect so many more fields," said Louise Erixon, leader of the Sweden Democrats in Solvesborg and Akesson's fiance.

"We have the feeling of insecurity across the country creeping into even the small places like Solvesborg, for example, which has always been a peaceful place where people have been able to feel safe."

Ali Kader is the owner of Solvesborg's pizzeria. As an Iraqi-Kurd, Kader came to Sweden when he was eight as a refugee, fleeing the Iran-Iraq war. Kader grew up in Gnosjo -- a factory town in Smaland, Sweden -- along with refugees from the Balkan wars. He says the political climate around refugees during his time in Gnosjo is similar to today's debate.

"When immigrants come, some people will always shout that 'we don't need this, it is bad for Sweden.' It was the same thing when the war in Yugoslavia was going on," Kader said.

"We had a lot of Bosnian and Albanians coming and it was the same discussion. But people seem to forget. The people that came from Balkans all have jobs, they are integrated."

Others are less sure why the far-right is surging in the polls. "I wonder that myself," said Helene Bjorklund, the mayor of Solvesborg and a Social Democrat, speculating that because Sweden has so few problems, migration has received most attention.

Pizzeria owner Ali Kader says previous immigrants from the Balkans are now integrated in Solvesborg.

A new version of Sweden

In Solvesborg, the disdain towards and distrust of Stockholm's political elite has only fueled the popularity of the Sweden Democrats, which on Sunday may win control of the regional government -- if not a national majority -- giving the party enough power to steer the political agenda there.

Kader, like many others in Sweden, fears the prospect of the far-right party winning both locally and nationally, and potentially winning influence in a coalition government,

"For me Sweden has been an open country. Sweden doesn't make a difference between people, their religion, ethnicity, where they come from and so on," said Kader.

"I am really worried. I think the Sweden Democrats are very bad for democracy in Sweden. We will soon be like Hungary and Poland."

With Macron on one side and on the other, Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who weighed in to wish Akesson "best wishes," the stakes in Sweden could not be higher for the rest of the continent.

"If this can happen in one of the most advanced, stable democracies in the world, where economic growth has been strong and unemployment has been low," said Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics and international relations at Kent University in the UK and author of the forthcoming book, National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy, "then it can basically happen in any other Western democracy."
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) A British member of parliament launched a protest outside the Nigerian embassy in London to help free kidnapped school girl Leah Sharibu, who friends say is being held by terror group Boko Haram for refusing to renounce her Christian faith.

Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake is staging a sit-in outside the Nigerian High Commission in central London to put pressure on the Nigerian government, he says.

Sharibu,15, was kidnapped alongside more than 100 schoolgirls in February this year.

Boko Haram freed the other schoolgirls after government negotiations, but Sharibu was kept behind.

"There cannot be a clearer example of someone whose human rights are being ignored than that of Leah who is being detained just because she has maintained her Christian faith," Brake said in an email interview with CNN.

President Trump talked about immigration, the upcoming midterm elections and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation at tonight's rally in West Virginia, but he never once mentioned Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen.

Why this matters: Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was found guilty today on eight counts of financial crimes. This is the first case Mueller brought to trial as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election.

Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty in Manhattan today to eight counts. The charges included tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-candidate.

The Cohen investigation was referred to the Southern District of New York by special counsel Robert Mueller. The plea deal does not include cooperation by Cohen, and it is unclear if he will follow through on his previous assertion to friends, according to sources, that he is willing to talk to Mueller.

Trump has repeatedly called the Mueller probe a "witch hunt" that hasn't found evidence of Russian collusion with his campaign, and his allies in and out of the White House say the special counsel should wrap things up.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A federal court on Thursday ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to ban a pesticide used widely in farming.

The 2-1 ruling on a lawsuit brought by public health groups and state attorneys general ordered the agency "to revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for chlorpyrifos within 60 days."

Concerns that the insecticide can harm the brain and nervous system led to the EPA banning the household use of chlorpyrifos in 2000. But the agency had allowed the chemical to continue to be used in commercial agriculture, where, some scientists say, it can be used in safe quantities.

"EPA is reviewing the decision," spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement on Thursday. He wrote that the data behind a Columbia University scientific study considered by the Obama administration and the court during their reviews of the pesticide "remains inaccessible" to the agency.

The EPA and the courts have considered an outright ban on the chemical since 2007, when public health groups petitioned the agency, and in August 2015, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to make a decision.

__label__politics (CNN) Federal prosecutors are preparing criminal charges against President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen and could announce them by the end of the month, people familiar with the matter tell CNN.

The US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York has been investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud and campaign finance violations related in part to a $130,000 hush money payment made to silence porn star Stormy Daniels' allegations of an affair with Trump. Trump has denied an affair.

Investigators are also examining more than $20 million in loans obtained for Cohen and his family's taxi companies, The New York Times reported Sunday night, citing people familiar with the matter.

Criminal charges against Cohen would be a major setback to President Donald Trump because Cohen has long been in his inner circle. Cohen has prided himself over the years on his reputation as Trump's pit bull and once said he "would take a bullet" for Trump.

But Trump's longtime consigliere has since broken allegiance with his former boss. Cohen has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the investigation, but it isn't clear if prosecutors are interested in a deal or what information he has to offer them. The US Attorney's office operates under the guidelines of the Justice Department, which advises against indicting a sitting president.

(CNN) President Donald Trump is about to come face-to-face with his next quarterly brush with Armageddon. Should he, or shouldn't he, scrap the Iran nuclear accord?

Any decision by him to "decertify" Iran's compliance, will have only a cataclysmic impact on the key issues he has cited for ending the pact and snapping back a range of tough sanctions that would accompany any such action.

The President would not be helping American or Western security. He certainly would not be helping hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who have taken to the streets across Iran.

What such a decision will do is seriously compromise American relations with all its major European allies, as foreign ministers of most European countries suggested on Thursday morning in a tense Brussels meeting.

At the same time, withdrawal would give new strength to Russia and China in global affairs -- united against the US in upholding what, to much of the world, appears to be the only real means of restraining Iran from developing nuclear arms. At the same time, America would be left even further isolated as a global pariah.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.

The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump.

Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's team, which is leading the investigation into Russia's involvement in the election, has been provided details of these communications.

A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine's former ruling party, the sources told CNN.

The surveillance was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence, according to one of the sources.

The FBI then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year.

Sources say the second warrant was part of the FBI's efforts to investigate ties between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian operatives. Such warrants require the approval of top Justice Department and FBI officials, and the FBI must provide the court with information showing suspicion that the subject of the warrant may be acting as an agent of a foreign power.

It is unclear when the new warrant started. The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort, the sources told CNN. As part of the FISA warrant, CNN has learned that earlier this year, the FBI conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort. It's not known what they found.

The conversations between Manafort and Trump continued after the President took office, long after the FBI investigation into Manafort was publicly known, the sources told CNN. They went on until lawyers for the President and Manafort insisted that they stop, according to the sources.

It's unclear whether Trump himself was picked up on the surveillance.

The White House declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for Manafort didn't comment for this story.

Manafort previously has denied that he ever "knowingly" communicated with Russian intelligence operatives during the election and also has denied participating in any Russian efforts to "undermine the interests of the United States."

The FBI wasn't listening in June 2016, the sources said, when Donald Trump Jr. led a meeting that included Manafort, then campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law, with a Russian lawyer who had promised negative information on Hillary Clinton.

That gap could prove crucial as prosecutors and investigators under Mueller work to determine whether there's evidence of a crime in myriad connections that have come to light between suspected Russian government operatives and associates of Trump.

Origins of the FBI's interest in Manafort

The FBI interest in Manafort dates back at least to 2014, partly as an outgrowth of a US investigation of Viktor Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president whose pro-Russian regime was ousted amid street protests. Yanukovych's Party of Regions was accused of corruption, and Ukrainian authorities claimed he squirreled millions of dollars out of the country.

Investigators have spent years probing any possible role played by Manafort's firm and other US consultants, including the Podesta Group and Mercury LLC, that worked with the former Ukraine regime. The basis for the case hinged on the failure by the US firms to register under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law that the Justice Department only rarely uses to bring charges.

All three firms earlier this year filed retroactive registrations with the Justice Department.

It hasn't proved easy to make a case.

Last year, Justice Department prosecutors concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges against Manafort or anyone of the other US subjects in the probe, according to sources briefed on the investigation.

The FBI and Justice Department have to periodically seek renewed FISA authorization to continue their surveillance.

As Manafort took the reins as Trump campaign chairman in May, the FBI surveillance technicians were no longer listening. The fact he was part of the campaign didn't play a role in the discontinued monitoring, sources told CNN. It was the lack of evidence relating to the Ukraine investigation that prompted the FBI to pull back.

Renewed surveillance

Manafort was ousted from the campaign in August. By then the FBI had noticed what counterintelligence agents thought was a series of odd connections between Trump associates and Russia. The CIA also had developed information, including from human intelligence sources, that they believed showed Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his intelligence services to conduct a broad operation to meddle with the US election, according to current and former US officials.

The FBI surveillance teams, under a new FISA warrant, began monitoring Manafort again, sources tell CNN.

The court that oversees government snooping under FISA operates in secret, the surveillance so intrusive that the existence of the warrants only rarely become public.

For that reason, speculation has run rampant about whether Manafort or others associated with Trump were under surveillance. The President himself fueled the speculation when in March he used his Twitter account to accuse former President Barack Obama of having his "wires tapped" in Trump Tower.

The Justice Department and the FBI have denied that Trump's own "wires" were tapped.

While Manafort has a residence in Trump Tower, it's unclear whether FBI surveillance of him took place there.

Manafort has a home as well in Alexandria, Virginia. FBI agents raided the Alexandria residence in July.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The FBI has fired Peter Strzok, an agent who was removed from the Russia probe last year for sending text messages disparaging President Donald Trump, Strzok's lawyer said Monday.

Aitan Goelman, Strzok's attorney, said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered the agent's termination on Friday. Goelman said that the deputy director's decision comes after the head of the office that normally handles disciplinary actions decided Strzok should instead face a demotion and 60-day suspension.

"The decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical Bureau practice, but also contradicts (FBI) Director (Christopher) Wray's testimony to Congress and his assurances that the FBI intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters," Goelman said in his statement.

Strzok included his lawyer's statement in a post on Twitter in which the former FBI agent said he was "deeply saddened" by the FBI's decision.

"It has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI," Strzok wrote, including a link to a GoFundMe account intended to cover his legal costs and lost income.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Tom Homan is serving his last day Friday as the controversial face of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration retires.

Homan's final day was confirmed by spokeswoman Liz Johnson.

The polarizing face of the administration's immigration enforcement, and a favorite of President Donald Trump himself, Homan had announced in April he would be taking his long-delayed retirement this month.

Homan has told the story of receiving the request to stay on as chief of ICE under Trump while celebrating at his going away party -- a retirement that was deferred for a year and a half.

On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced that acting CBP Deputy Commissioner Ronald Vitiello would take over as acting director of ICE in Homan's stead.

Vitiello "brings to ICE the vision and leadership needed to continue the exceptional work the agency is doing to accomplish its crucial national security and public safety missions," Nielsen said in a statement.

"I am pleased that ICE will continue to be led by an experienced and well-respected career law enforcement officer who will be a strong advocate for the agency's workforce," she added.

A source familiar with the situation had told CNN that Vitiello was expected to be named acting director of ICE as soon as Friday.

Vitiello has been a familiar face for the media as well, often speaking with reporters about the President's border wall project.

Homan had been able to serve temporarily in the role since the beginning of the Trump administration, despite never being confirmed by the Senate, because he had already been the deputy in line for the job. But since Vitiello comes from a different agency, it's likely that federal law would prevent him from serving in the role in an acting capacity while also nominated to the Senate for the permanent position.

Homan was nominated for the position in November, but his nomination was withdrawn in May, never having a confirmation hearing.

Nielsen said that under "his exceptional leadership, the men and women of ICE have made significant progress in restoring the rule of law to our immigration system and countering criminals such as human smugglers and those attempting to exploit children."

Any nomination in the Senate would likely by highly contentious, as ICE has been the main focus of criticism regarding the President's aggressive immigration agenda.
__label__world (CNN) US President Donald Trump has arrived in Brussels with a clear message: NATO members must hike their defense spending and they must do it now.

Trump has long called on other NATO members to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, as the transatlantic alliance's own guidelines recommend.

He has a point. The US spent more than 3.5% of its GDP on defense last year, and far more in previous years, while only three other member nations -- the UK, Greece and Estonia -- passed the 2% threshold last year, NATO data shows. Poland slipped in 2017 below the benchmark to 1.99%.

"I think these countries have to step it up, not over a 10-year period, but they have to step it up immediately," Trump said in Brussels on Wednesday, on day one of the summit. NATO allies in 2014 agreed to try and reach their 2% target over a decade, by 2024, too long a time frame for Trump. He pointed specifically to Germany as a wealthy nation that could boost spending now.

There was never any doubt Trump would come down hard on his mostly European allies in the 29-member alliance. He has spent recent days on Twitter slamming NATO as "very unfair."

A White House spokesman made clear last week the President will tell NATO that the US is not the world's piggy bank.

Is the 2% threshold reasonable?

While the 2% threshold has eluded some members -- whom Trump has slammed as "delinquents" -- most have boosted their spending in real-dollar figures in recent years.

NATO was formed after World War II and on the principle of collective defense -- an attack against one or more members is considered an attack against all. Each nation puts very little money in a NATO pot of funds. The idea is that each nation should have its own strong defense force, which requires a certain level of spending by individual members.

Trump is not the first US president to point this out.

"Lots of American presidents and administrations have made that point and pleaded with allies to increase spending. They just did it more politely," Elisabeth Braw, adjunct fellow from the Center for European Policy Analysis, told CNN.

Defense expenditure had largely dropped at the beginning of the decade, because Europe was relatively peaceful.

But following Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its annexation of the Crimean peninsula, all NATO members agreed in 2014 to reach the 2% threshold by 2024.

Trump has taken on a threatening tone ahead of the Brussels meeting , sending a series of letters to NATO allies , including Germany, Belgium and Canada, demanding they boost spending and threatening to shift the US military presence in Europe if they do not. The letters were first reported in The New York Times.

"I think Trump does have a point, but I think the way in which he's making his point is very unhelpful, because he's so unpopular here in Europe. If he bullies European leaders into spending more domestically, I think it would be foolish for them to spend as much as he wants them to because they will be seen as essentially just obeying his commands," Braw said.

She added that US Defense Secretary James Mattis, for example, could have made the case.

"He enjoys wide respect among allies -- but it seems to have almost become an obsession for Trump, and paradoxically I think it would lead to smaller increases, and that is very unfortunate, because it's clear the security situation is deteriorating in Europe."

Braw said, however, that expecting defense spending at 2% of GDP is largely reasonable.

"The idea is that every country should have strong armed forces on its own, so that NATO really just is for common defense -- it shouldn't be that there are free riders who spend almost nothing but say, 'I'm a member of an alliance.'"

What does the US get out of NATO?

But Braw and other experts also acknowledge there is more than financial value to NATO. The alliance allows the US to have a strong foothold in Europe, a presence that has traditionally helped it counter Russia's influence in the region.

It also allows the US to launch military action in other regions, mainly the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.

In Germany alone, the US has 152 military sites for its army and air force, US Defense Department data from 2017 shows . The US' largest military hospital abroad is in Germany, and it uses bases in the country as "lily pads" to go back and forth from countries like Afghanistan.

Karen von Hippel, director-general of the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), points to other nonfinancial benefits to the US being in NATO, such as support in times of conflict.

"I don't think he understands what alliances are -- everything is, 'What are you going to give me and what am I going to get out of it?'" she said.

"I don't think he understands all the other things that come with alliances, whether it's your friends fighting in wars for you and losing lives. I mean, don't forget, many countries went to Iraq and Afghanistan and many, many soldiers were killed from all these countries, and it was not their war, it was an American war really, more than anything else. And so alliances are a lot more than the balance sheet, and I don't think he fully understands that."

What does this mean for Russia?

NATO was founded partly in response to the threat by the Soviet Union after the war. It has also been used as show of unity and strength against Russia in the region more recently.

Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, often say NATO is the aggressor, and bemoan NATO military exercises on Russia's doorstep. NATO is also a painful reminder of the territory the Soviet Union lost, as Moscow watches countries it once ruled over join an alliance that was built to oppose it.

There is concern that Trump's decision to meet with Putin right after attending the NATO summit and taking a trip to the UK, a key NATO member, spells trouble for the alliance.

Few think Trump will pull the US out altogether, but there are concerns that as NATO's most powerful member, a US too close to Russia could complicate the alliance's raison d'être to a degree.

"Putin is emboldened pretty much with or without Trump. We've seen that over the last few years. But Trump seems to be doing everything Putin wants him to do and why he is doing that is still a mystery to many people, including many people in Trump's own government," von Hippel said.

"Of course, he will be coming to the UK just after that meeting as well, and meeting with the Prime Minister here, and you know, this country is very committed to NATO. And if he really does drop a bombshell, that will obviously impact the visit here, and then of course who knows what will happen with Putin?"
__label__politics (CNN) US President Donald Trump, facing scrutiny for hush money payments to a porn star and a former Playboy model, pleaded with evangelical leaders for political help during closed-door remarks on Monday, warning of dire consequences to their congregations should Republicans lose in November's midterm elections.

"This November 6 election is very much a referendum on not only me, it's a referendum on your religion, it's a referendum on free speech and the First Amendment. It's a referendum on so much," Trump told the assemblage of pastors and other Christian leaders gathered in the State Dining Room, according to a recording from people in the room.

"It's not a question of like or dislike, it's a question that they will overturn everything that we've done and they will do it quickly and violently. And violently. There is violence. When you look at Antifa -- these are violent people," Trump said, describing what would happen should his voters fail to cast ballots. "You have tremendous power. You were saying, in this room, you have people who preach to almost 200 million people. Depending on which Sunday we're talking about."

Antifa -- a loose collection of anti-fascist groups who regularly stage counter-protests against white supremacists and neo-Nazis -- have emerged as an effective bogeyman for segments of the US right.

In a video released last year by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the pro-gun group used footage from street protests and occasional Antifa violence to paint all on the US left as seeking to "bully and terrorize the law-abiding."

__label__world Rome (CNN) Pope Francis said Wednesday that his recent meeting in Ireland with eight people who suffered sex abuse by figures in the Catholic Church left a "profound mark" on him, but suggested that the right measures were being put in place to ensure such abuse cannot happen again.

Addressing the child sex abuse scandal in Ireland at his weekly Vatican address, the Pope said he had "begged the Lord for forgiveness for these sins, the scandal and the sense of betrayal."

His words came in the midst of a renewed wave of outrage regarding child sex abuse in the Catholic Church, and just three days after a visit to Ireland -- a majority Catholic country -- where he was met with protesters angry about the scandal and a smaller crowd of supporters than expected.

"My visit to Ireland, despite the great joy, also had to bear the pain and bitterness of the suffering caused in that country by various forms of abuse, even by members of the Church, and the fact that the Church authorities in the past have not always been able to adequately address these crimes," the Pope said Wednesday.

He went on to express hope that this could change, saying that "the Irish bishops have undertaken a serious path of purification and reconciliation with those who have suffered abuse" and established "strict rules" that would ensure the safety of young people.

__label__politics Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe , a think tank providing independent research on Brexit. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

Between now and early January at the latest, a deal needs to be struck on Brexit between the UK and the European Union which ties up all the loose ends after Britain walks away from 40 years of membership.

In addition, the groundwork needs to be laid in defining what the relationship will look like in the future.

So, what agreements have been reached, and what remains to be done?

When it comes to the "divorce," many -- if not most -- of the outstanding issues have been settled. The UK has agreed to pay a generous "divorce bill" and both sides have agreed to settle the status of their respective citizens in each other's territory.

The main outstanding issue, the one that must be causing negotiators to lose sleep at night, remains Northern Ireland -- or, more precisely, the question of what to do once Britain leaves the EU to avert the need for a customs and regulatory border between it and the Republic of Ireland to the south: an EU member state.

Which brings us back to our returning (and doubtless well-tanned) parliamentarians. At some point over the next few months, they will be asked to vote on whatever deal the government strikes with the EU.

The European Union has stated repeatedly that the choices on the table are limited. Either Britain remains within the EU's single market, or it leaves it altogether. Similarly, the UK either remains in the customs union, or it faces the imposition of tariffs and other impediments on trade

So Britain faces a choice. It might decide to remain very closely linked to the EU -- part of its market and customs union and therefore still subject to EU laws (over which, as a non-member, it will no longer have any say) and bound to accept the right of EU citizens to come here and work. Or, we can have a more distant relationship -- a "cleaner Brexit" in the jargon, and leave the single market and customs union.

JUST WATCHED Uncertainty in Wales as Brexit looms Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Uncertainty in Wales as Brexit looms 03:46

The problem is that, in the latter case, the EU will insist on a different status for Northern Ireland, keeping it more closely tied to the EU than the rest of the UK so as to avoid the imposition of a north-south border on the island

And here's the rub. As things stand, it is hard to see there being a majority in the British Parliament for either of these outcomes.

Many MPs would view the former option as a betrayal of those who voted leave precisely to escape from EU law and end the freedom of movement of workers. Meanwhile, not only are less EU-hostile MPs wary of the economic costs of a cleaner break , but the British parliament is unlikely in the extreme to vote for an outcome that will separate part of the country from the rest of it with a customs and regulatory border.

So as the endgame approaches, and despite the progress made, an obvious achievable outcome is as hard to imagine as ever.

Of course, a lot can change. Such is the febrile state of British politics that it is virtually impossible to predict how our parliamentarians will vote in a vote that will not be held for some months.

And of course, the EU position might change. The sharp rise in the pound following what appeared to some to be positive comments about Brexit ambitions from the EU's chief negotiator underlined what a game changer such a shift would represent.

Unfortunately, that was largely all the incident represented, as Michel Barnier's comments were somewhat misinterpreted and did not imply the kind of softening in the EU's approach that many in Britain assumed (or, rather, hoped, they did).

So there is still much to play for. It is as hard to predict the eventual shape of the Brexit outcome as it ever has been. All we can be sure of is that it will continue to be the single most important issue in our politics for the foreseeable future, dominating governmental and parliamentary agendas, and continuing to feed the anger and bitterness that continue to bedevil our political debates.

__label__politics Special counsel Robert Mueller has now brought 191 criminal charges against 32 people and 3 companies as part of his investigation into Russian meddling and related matters. This includes today’s indictment which has 112 new charges against 12 Russian operatives.

Support for the investigation is slipping: Most Americans continue to believe that the Russian effort to influence the 2016 presidential election is a serious matter that should be investigated, but the constant criticism by President Donald Trump of of the "rigged witch hunt" is taking its toll, according to a recent CNN poll

The number of Americans who approve of how Mueller is handling the investigation has dropped from 48% in March to 44% in May to just 41% in June, the lowest it has been in CNN's polling.

Earlier Friday, just hours before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the latest round of indictments, President Trump again assailed the investigation as a "rigged witch hunt" and said it "really hurts our country." He made the remarks knowing the indictments were coming -- Rosenstein briefed the President earlier this week.
__label__politics Former President Barack Obama spoke of the present moment, where "so much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. Trafficking in bombast and insult. Phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear."

McCain, Obama said, "called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that."

Obama added: "What better way to honor John McCain's life of service than as best we can follow his example to prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, and in fact it is demanded of all of us as citizens of this great republic."

Concluding his remarks, Obama added, "That's perhaps how we honor him best, by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power, that there are some things that are worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding."

"At his best," Obama said, "John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt."

The former president walked out from behind the podium and into the open arms of Cindy McCain, and the two briefly embraced as she appeared to thank him for his remarks.

__label__politics (CNN) Trade deficits aren't a concern for America's farmers ... but you wouldn't know it from what President Donald Trump has been saying.

The US agriculture industry has long exported far more products than the nation has imported. Selling crops, nuts, meat and other goods abroad are vital part of the sector, with more than 20% of agricultural production sent abroad. That has led to a trade surplus, which totaled $20.3 billion in fiscal 2017 and is projected to grow to $22.5 billion in this fiscal year, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Trump, however, has repeatedly said that American farmers are suffering under bad trade deals with other countries. His solution to help them and other industries? Slap tariffs on imports, which has prompted other countries to retaliate by doing the same to American products.

China has since added a 25% tariff to soybeans, on top of the existing 3% levy. Its tariffs on pork are now 70%, rather than the previous 20%, said Veronica Nigh, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, an industry group.

Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2018

Trump's moves are threatening to disrupt the industry's trade balance. Prices are falling, and exports are dropping, experts say. Other countries are looking to move in on American farmers' turf.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen has indicated to family and friends he is willing to cooperate with federal investigators to alleviate the pressure on himself and his family, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Cohen has expressed anger with the treatment he has gotten from the President, who has minimized his relationship with Cohen, and comments from the President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the source said. The treatment has left him feeling isolated and more open to cooperating, the source said.

Asked by reporters Friday if he was worried about Cohen cooperating, Trump said, "I did nothing wrong, nothing wrong." He also said he hasn't spoken with Cohen "in a long time," adding, "I always liked Michael and he's a good person."

CBS News reported Thursday that Cohen believes Trump and his allies are turning against him.

Cohen is under criminal investigation by the US attorney's office in Manhattan for his personal financial dealings, including the payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf before the election.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans are sending decidedly mixed messages about how they feel about the future of Attorney General Jeff Sessions amid unrelenting criticism from President Donald Trump.

Key GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have signaled in recent days they'd be open to replacing Sessions after the midterm elections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, threw his weight behind Sessions Tuesday in no uncertain terms.

"I have total confidence in the attorney general. I think he ought to stay exactly where he is," McConnell told reporters.

A source close to Sessions told CNN that he spoke with McConnell last week, and Sessions has received a number of calls of support behind the scenes from his former colleagues after last week's dust-up with Trump.

But Sessions' tense relationship with Trump may only be one factor in the shift in support for Sessions on Capitol Hill from some of his earlier defenders.

While Trump's sustained criticism of Sessions has left some Republicans questioning the productivity and longevity of Sessions' tenure at the Justice Department, a person familiar with the ongoing mood of the Republican conference told CNN that there is also frustration with Sessions' concrete policy difference with senators on issues like sentencing reform and legalizing marijuana.

According to the person familiar, Sessions' team is "counting their friends" right now and while last year or even a few months ago people were more willing to dive in to help, fewer are "rushing to the microphone to defend him."

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who previously warned against firing Sessions, said last week that he has more time for hearings on nominations now than he did last year. For months, Grassley has butted heads with Sessions over criminal justice reform, which bubbled over again last week into public view.

After Grassley made the comments about having time for another nomination hearing -- an insinuation that Sessions could be replaced -- a source close to Sessions said at the time that the attorney general wasn't going to be "blackmailed" into supporting a criminal justice bill he didn't agree with or thinks undermines the criminal justice system.

On Tuesday, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham also dug in and said that Trump's relationship with Sessions was "beyond repair" and suggested the attorney general should be replaced after the midterms.

"The President has lost confidence in Jeff Sessions. I'm telling you what everybody in the country knows, this is a dysfunctional relationship, we need a better one," the South Carolina Republican said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show.

Some senators still deny that Sessions is in a worse position than he was a few months ago even as they say it's been tough to watch their former colleague repeatedly berated by Trump on Twitter.

"I am always surprised. If I have a problem with a staff member or if I have a disagreement with a staff member, I go talk to him. I don't tweet about it," Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, said.

Sen. John Thune, the No. 3 Republican, disagreed that Sessions was losing support in the Senate and said he thought "people are just looking at the tea leaves in terms of what the President is saying and trying to divine what that means for Jeff, but I don't think he's lost support up here."

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, told CNN at this point, a lot of Republicans just feel bad for Sessions, a former GOP senator from Alabama.

"He was a colleague. We all respect him. We feel bad for him, truthfully. This isn't good to see. I don't like to see this kind of public division and this thing play out in public," Johnson said.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said she doesn't know if Sessions is losing support among her colleagues, but "not among people I have talked to."

"They've got a challenging relationship, the attorney general and the President, that's known to all and they'll have to work it out one way or another. Sessions is an old friend of mine, I worked with him for 20 years. I have a lot of respect for him, but at the same time he works for the President," said Sen. Dick Shelby, a Republican from Alabama where Sessions once served. "I don't know what's going to happen. I think both of them need to put the nation first."
__label__politics (CNN) The Supreme Court just handed a huge victory to the Trump administration by upholding its controversial travel ban -- which restricts nationals from seven countries from entering the US.

But there have been several versions of the travel ban, along with plenty of confusion. Here's what the latest travel ban means to citizens of those countries -- and some American citizens, too.

The countries in the ban

This is the third version of the travel ban, issued in September after previous bans bounced around through the courts. The Trump administration says this latest version restricts entry from the following seven countries to varying degrees:

Iran

North Korea

Syria

Libya

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and former British spy Christopher Steele -- frequent targets of President Donald Trump's ire related to the Russia investigation -- were involved in US efforts to flip a Russian oligarch with ties to the Kremlin, The New York Times reports.

Between 2014 and 2016, the FBI and the Justice Department sought and attempted to turn Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska into an informant for the United States, the Times reported Saturday

Citing current and former officials and associates of Deripaska, the Times reported that investigators were hoping for information from Deripaska on Russian organized crime during a September 2015 meeting and, in a meeting a year later, on possible Russian aid to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The effort to recruit Deripaska was part of a broader, classified US initiative that attempted to gain the cooperation of several Russian oligarchs, the Times reported. The newspaper added that the effort did not seem to have had any successes; Deripaska told US investigators he disagreed with them on Russian organized crime and ideas about possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, a person familiar with the exchanges told the Times.

According to the Times, Ohr and Steele first discussed flipping Deripaska in November 2014. Working as an intermediary, Steele helped arrange a meeting between Deripaska and US officials, including Ohr, in 2015, during which Deripaska was asked about the connections between Russian organized crime and Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, the Times reported, citing a person familiar with the events.

__label__world Kollam, India (CNN) As devastating floods hit India's southern state of Kerala, thousands scrambled up to the higher floors in their buildings and crouched together on balconies, waiting desperately for help.

And then, finally, the rescue boats came.

Fishermen, who had loaded their boats onto trucks, voluntarily traveled to Kerala's inner towns and villages, inundated with more than 10 feet of water. Most people gave them a hero's welcome, grateful to be evacuated after a long wait.

But others have hurled insults and abuse at the volunteers.

Marion George, a 47-year-old fisherman, reached a home in the city of Kollam on Friday with a family of 17 trapped inside.

When he told them that he was there to help them, he was asked, "Isn't this a Christian boat?"

Fisherman Marion George says Hindu Brahmin flood victims would only let him rescue them if he did not touch them.

When he replied that, yes, he was a Christian, the men in the family refused to get in his boat and waved him away.

The men were from India's highest Hindu caste , Brahmin, and would not go near George, despite their desperation.

Five hours later, George was back in the same neighborhood and saw the same family calling for his help. He docked his boat close to their home but was again told by the men that they would only board if he did not touch them.

"Normally, their attitude is like this only. We just thought that in this situation, they would have changed," George said.

A volunteer fishermen rests on his nets in an evacuation operation in Kollam, India.

George estimated that he rescued 150 people over two days until his boat was too damaged to continue.

CNN spoke to several other fishermen who also reported being insulted and treated suspiciously by victims they were trying to help.

The Kerala state government has said that more than 2,800 fishermen have been involved in the relief effort.

More than 300 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced, as torrential rains triggered the state's worst flooding in nearly a century, destroying homes and roads. People are clinging to anything that floats to get them out of their homes.

People refuse to leave their homes

There is also an issue of trust in strangers. People have been reluctant to leave their homes and belongings behind out of fear that they will be robbed.

Arun Michael, a fisherman in Kollam, saw the news of the flash floods on TV on Wednesday last week and decided to help. On Thursday morning, he loaded his 32-foot boat onto a truck lent out by the local police and he and three others made their way to the district of Pathanamthitta.

Fisherman Arun Michael with his daughter, Andrea Marie, after he and other rescuers evacuated more than 1,500 people over three days.

Over the next three days, Michael evacuated more than 1,500 people. He navigated his boat through strong currents and rising water levels, reaching flooded homes and helping people climb in. On the last day, he evacuated a total of 600 people.

"What happened now, can happen to anyone. If tomorrow something happens to us, we hope that help would come for us," he said.

But he was surprised to come across victims who greeted him with suspicion and insults.

Some people abused him for trying to convince them to evacuate, he said, referring to a number of victims. Some even made him first carry their dogs to the boat before climbing in themselves.

In some cases, people refused to leave their homes. "They were arrogant and just wanted us to give them food," he said.

But others have been grateful for the bravery and creativity of Michael and his fellow rescuers.

In one instance, Michael and his friends found a house filled with water. They swam out and broke through a door, finding a mentally ill woman in one of the rooms.

The team found three tables and stacked them on top of each other to make a stable base to carry her out, wading through water up to their chins. At times, to stabilize the tables, they had to go underwater, he said.

Arun Michael has not been able to go fishing since his boat was damaged in the evacuations.

The government has announced compensation of 3,000 rupees ($40) to each volunteer fisherman plus the costs to repair damaged boats.

For now, many of the fishermen have been unable to use their boats for fishing, waiting for authorities to deliver the money for quick repairs. But Michael isn't waiting.

"My boat is severely damaged but I won't take anything from the government," he said. "I didn't do it expecting benefits."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump says the new Air Force One planes will be red, white and blue, a shift away from the classic "baby blue" design that they have had for decades.

"Air Force One is going to be incredible," Trump told CBS in an interview over the weekend that aired on Tuesday. "It's going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And it's going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate."

A source familiar with the redesign told CNN last week that Trump was deeply involved in the conversation about a redesign of the aircraft, but no decisions had been reached on a final paint scheme.

The President has now confirmed that the changes were coming.

"Boeing gave us a good deal. And we were able to take that," Trump said. "But I said, 'I wonder if we should use the same baby blue colors?' And we're not."

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump spent Thursday grappling with how to prevent more school massacres and address the gun debate gripping the country, offering solutions such as giving bonuses to teachers who undergo gun training.

"These people are cowards. They're not going to walk into a school if 20% of the teachers have guns -- it may be 10% or may be 40%. And what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus," Trump said. "They'll frankly feel more comfortable having the gun anyway. But you give them a little bit of a bonus."

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah told reporters after Trump's comments that the proposal hasn't reached the policy or legislative point yet, but downplayed questions about how the plan would be funded.

"I think that if we find the policy solutions that make the most sense that we can get buy in for, we'll figure out the rest of the pieces that you outlined," he said.

Asked about the cost of a plan -- which could be well into the hundreds of millions of dollars -- Shah again repeated that the policy "hasn't been fleshed out" but added, "Do we really think that that's too much to pay for school safety?"

__label__politics Anaheim, California (CNN) Former President Barack Obama, a day after delivering a stinging critique of President Donald Trump's time in office, had a stark warning for fired-up Democrats in California: This is not rock bottom.

Obama urged the Democrats at his first rally of 2018 to get out and vote in November, telling them that the dismay they feel about Washington right now means nothing is they don't follow through by voicing their displeasure at the ballot box.

"This is a consequential moment in our history. The fact is if we don't step up things can get worse," he said to audible groans from the 750 Democrats in the room on Saturday. "When there is a vacuum in our democracy ... other voices fill the void. But the good news is in two months, we have a chance to restore some sanity in our politics. We have a chance to flip the House of Representatives."

The speech was a departure from the lengthy and direct rebuke of Trump he delivered on Friday, where he mentioned the current President two times and lambasted him for leaning on law enforcement to protect Republicans from prosecution, slammed him for "cozying up" to Russian President Vladimir Putin and faulted him for equivocating about who was at fault during the white supremacist protests last year in Charlottesville, Virginia.

On Saturday, Obama didn't mention Trump once and, instead, told Democrats that the problems in Washington are bigger than one person.

"The biggest threat to our democracy ... is not one individual, it is not one big super PAC billionaires," he said. "It is apathy, it is indifference, it is us not doing what we are supposed to do."

It was clear in the audience, however, that most attendees believed Trump was the biggest threat. When Obama began to describe what he thought was the biggest issue, a man in the audience yelled, "Trump."

The event, organized by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an attempt to boost seven Democrats running in districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 but which are represented by the Republicans in the House. The event officially ended Obama's absence from the campaign trail, a months-long void that has angered some Democrats who believe he is not engaging in a political fight where he could be helpful.

Obama touted the sevent candidates - Josh Harder (CA-10), TJ Cox (CA-21), Katie Hill (CA-25), Gil Cisneros (CA-39), Katie Porter (CA-45), Harley Rouda (CA-48), and Mike Levin (CA-49) - by name, casting them as people who understand how critical it is for Democrats to step up in 2018.

"It is always tempting for politicians, for their own gain, and for people in power, to try to see if they can divide people, scapegoat folks, turn them on each other because when that happens, you get gridlock and government doesn't work and people get cynical and they decide not to participate," he said. "That unfortunately has been a spiral that we have been on for the last couple of years."

His prescription, he said, was "when each of us as citizens say we are going to take it upon ourselves to do it differently."

And while the speech was not as direct as his remarks in Illinois, Obama did cast the current administration as one that is seizing on division.

That Illinois speech was a break from tradition -- one where former commanders-in-chief don't criticize their successors -- but Obama argued that Trump's presidency represented a time when everyone needed to stand up.

"You happen to be coming of age" amid backlash to progress, Obama told the students at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "It did not start with Donald Trump, he is a symptom, not the cause. He is just capitalizing on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years. A fear, an anger that is rooted in our past but is also borne in our enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes."

His overarching message in both speeches, however, was the complaining does nothing when people don't vote.

"Don't tell me your vote doesn't matter," he said in Illinois. "And if you thought elections don't matter, I hope these last two years have corrected the impression."

A polarizing draw to the polls

Those Democrats Obama rallied with on Saturday welcomed his return to the campaign trail.

"It's truly exciting to welcome President Obama to Southern California, and I welcome the opportunity to campaign alongside him and energize voters ahead of the final two months of the campaign," Cisneros said in a statement.

Chelsea Brossard, Harder's campaign manager, called Saturday an "all hands on deck moment" for the campaign and said they were "proud to have this level of support as we begin the final stretch."

But Republicans have been just as eager to welcome Obama back to the campaign trail, too, believing he will rally their base as much, if not more, than he rallies Democrats.

"For three cycles (2010, 2012, 2014) President Obama fired up Republicans like nobody," Rep. Steve Stivers, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters on Friday. "And I'm happy he wants to do it again."

While Clinton won all seven districts in 2016, Obama had won only three in 2012, leaving Democrats in the state hopeful that his Obama's return could end up helping them.

Cox, Democrats' nominee in CA-21, said that optimism was misplaced, and action necessary.

"This President and this Congress are hitting people right in the pocket book and people see that," Cox said, arguing Obama will offer them an image of Democratic leadership. "The best thing the president (Obama) could say is this: Vote, vote, vote. And that is it. We can march, we can rally, we can put signs up. All that matters ... is getting out there and voting."

Following his California visit, Obama will travel to Ohio next Thursday for an event for Richard Cordray, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, and he is also slated to headline a campaign event in Pennsylvania later this month, and a New York fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, Obama's longtime friend.
__label__world (CNN) Along the lush sea-islands and the Atlantic coastal plains of the southern East coast of America, a distinctive group of tidewater communities has stuck together throughout the centuries, preserving its African cultural heritage and carving out a lifestyle that is uniquely its own.

The Gullah/Geechee people are direct descendants of West African slaves brought into the United States around the 1700s. They were forced to work in rice paddies, cotton fields and indigo plantations along the South Carolina-Georgia seaboard where the moist climate and fertile land were very similar to their African homelands.

After the abolition of slavery, they settled in remote villages around the coastal swath, where, thanks to their relative isolation, they formed strong communal ties and a unique culture that has endured for centuries.

"The Gullah/Geechee Nation is an extremely tightly knit community," says Chieftess Queen Quet, who was chosen to represent the Gullah/Geechee people in 2000. "It is as tightly knit as a sweet grass basket that's sewn together and as tightly knit as a cast net is sewn together -- there's strength in it and that means if you pull on it, you can't just get it to break apart."

Brought to America from rice-producing Sierra Leone and other surrounding countries, the enslaved Africans came from a wide variety of ethnic groups. For many of them, the first contact with the New World was Sullivan's Island -- just off Charleston, South Carolina -- a place of huge emotional value for the Gullah/Geechee community to this day.

"This is the landing point for over 40% of all the African people enslaved in North America," says Queen Quet. "It represents a place of pain; it also represents a place of connection because we're standing at the shore and we're looking eastward -- we're looking back home, we're looking to our mother, the mother land, mother Africa."

Carlie Towne, minister of information of the Gullah/Geechee Nation, says the Africans brought to the island were quarantined in pestilence houses to make sure they didn't have any diseases.

"A lot of people refer to this as the Ellis Island, but it's not, because we did not come freely," says Towne. "It didn't kill the spirit, because we are here today and paying homage today to our ancestors. It actually gave us a sense of community, of living together. Everything we did, it was a way for us to actually become who we are. It actually made us stronger and we continue today the legacy of our ancestors."

To this day, the Gullah/Geechee people are trying to hold steadfastly to the way of life of their African ancestors, passing on their traditions from one generation to the next.

They gather sweet grass to practice the ancient African art of basket making; they pay homage to their West African traditions by keeping alive the ring shout music folk tradition; they make a living by fishing shrimps and harvesting oysters, using handmade nets and casting them the way their ancestors did centuries ago.

"I fished with my father ever since I've been seven or eight," says Ricky Wright, vice president of the Gullah/Geechee Fishing Association. "It passes down because it's just a natural thing for us -- my parents did it, I'm quite sure my parents' parents did it, and it just descended down."

It is this natural connection that helps the Gullah/Geechee community tie their past to their future survival.

"[It's] almost like history repeating itself, what goes around comes around," says Wright. "OK, we've entered the computer age, but we still have to have hands-on for most of the things we do and fishing is like hands-on. You've got to do it to know it -- to keep the culture strong is to keep what you do intact."

JUST WATCHED The importance of preserving the Gullah language Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The importance of preserving the Gullah language 00:54

Another key trait marking the population's distinctive cultural identity is the use of an English-based creole vernacular known as Gullah. Professor Salikoko S. Mufwene, of the department of linguistics at the University of Chicago, says the enslaved Africans and their descendants created the dialect in response to their own linguistic diversity.

"It is English modified under the influence of African languages," he says. "Any population that appropriates the language that is not their own, they are going to modify it."

Estimates about the current number of Gullah/Geechee people vary and exact figures are hard to verify. Gullah/Geechee leaders say that an approximately one million people belong to the nation, while other reports put the number closer to 250,000.

Mufwene says that after the Second World War there were several migrations out of the region towards cities like New York and Washington in search of jobs. He adds, however, that many of those who'd depart would often become disenchanted with life in the city and return back home.

What seems to be more certain is that Gullah/Geechee people have preserved the cultural heritage of their ancestors more than any other black Americans in the United States.

"We have the highest retention of African tradition in America," says Towne. "African-Americans have assimilated more so they don't have those African traditions that we have -- they don't treasure them, they don't honor their tradition like we do. And we've been able to hold onto that because of isolation, because of the strong will and our self-determination. We still eat the same foods [as] our ancestors [when they] came from Africa."

Mufwene agrees. He says the Gullah/Geechee people cook differently from continental African-Americans and the ways they interact with each other are very reminiscent of traditional life in Africa.

"They have also kept animal tales that are very similar to animal tales in Africa," he adds. "The characters are not exactly the same, because the ecology has changed, but the themes of the tales are very similar to the themes that you find in Africa."

Back on Sullivan's Island, overlooking the vast ocean that brought her ancestors to the shores of enslavement, Towne says Gullah/Geechee people should not lose sight of their past.

"This is actually the bloodline of our people, the water," she says. "I must come here and my children come here. And my children's children must come here too. Because we must never forget."

Accra, Ghana (CNN) "Google is just a giant scientific research company that happens to make money," this was my first impression when I visited their offices in Mountain View for the first time.

I was not wrong, a lot of what Google does is to push the boundaries of human knowledge through research and discovery.

It is that curiosity that has led them to create some of the most widely used technology platforms in the world today and also made them the custodian of most of the data about almost anything in the world.

Google has also now declared itself an "Artificial Intelligence first," company and that statement is potentially going to change everything we know fundamentally. It will almost certainly change how we live.

This change will also resonate for us in Africa; Google just recently announced that Africa is getting a Google Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and that is just the beginning. The lab will be run by Moustapha Cisse, a Senegalese AI champion and expert.

Why is Africa Dark?

It was 2010 at the annual GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and Eric Schmidt the former CEO and Chairman of Google was presenting his keynote where he was proudly talking of the growth of Android, Google's new mobile operating system at that time.

He had a slide on the screen with lights showing the level of Android activations globally, but on that slide Africa was dark. Someone in the audience asked; "Why is Africa dark?"

Someone else repeated a similar question at another presentation during Google's annual developer event in San Francisco in 2013. The presenter was talking about Google's Cloud Platform, and once again there was a global map where Africa was blank.

The question also came up -- "What happened to Africa?"

Google didn't seem to have any activity in Africa from both maps, but the illustrations were wrong. They were already active in Africa, but they decided to take a different route.

Google opted to strengthen the educational institutions by providing infrastructure and software, then from those institutions build technology communities which have now come of age.

There are hardly any young software developers you would meet in any of the major African countries who have not been part of or somewhat influenced by Google's university-based Developer Groups.

At the Barcelona keynote, someone also asked Eric Schmidt a question about plans for Africa and especially Nigeria?

With surprising accuracy for the CEO of a global technology company, he highlighted the issues with infrastructure and last-mile connectivity hampering growth and expansion of Internet technology into Africa.

Google was not ignoring Africa; they were trying to figure out a solution.

The solution has now come in many forms; massive infrastructure projects, digital skills training for millions, investments into the African startup ecosystem and most recently the announcement of an Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Accra, Ghana.

Why Ghana?

The question everyone was asking after Jeff Dean (the Google AI and Google Brain team lead) announced that Google AI Lab was coming to Accra was "Why Ghana?"

The answer to that has been clear for a while now but has eluded most people.

When Barack Obama decided to visit Ghana as the first African country during his Presidency, it was the same question most people asked - "Why Ghana?"

The answer is simple; Ghana is the future of Africa.

When I decided to move away from Nigeria to Ghana almost a decade ago, most people could not understand why because they had not visited Ghana, I did and I fell in love, literally.

I married a Fanti woman. I had already fallen for the country before I met my wife because the place was different.

It didn't have the hardcore market edge of places like Nigeria and South Africa, but it was a place where I could live and work.

Ghana has relatively stable electricity, relative security, and decent internet infrastructure. It also has some of the best tourist destinations in the developing world. All of this is present without any hype. I moved our business there and didn't look back ever since.

This choice is in spite of the challenges the country has gone through in recent times. I have remained and will continue to do so.

Google probably, however, has different reasons for choosing Ghana, and Jeff Dean tried to explain that it had to do with the robust network of academic institutions as well as infrastructure.

Google has been a significant investor in strengthening those institutions and the infrastructure around it.

An Alphabet Subsidiary named CSquared spun out of Google has quietly been laying an extensive fiber optic backbone in Accra and Kampala to help solve the last-mile internet problem that Eric Schmidt mentioned in Barcelona.

The internet speeds I get in the office and at home in Accra are now comparable with California speeds.

Ghana has also become a melting pot for education in the sub-region over the years because of the relative stability of the country and the high standards of its institutions, such as the highly-regarded Ashesi University.

The foundations of Ghanaian education are about the strongest in the region. It is not uncommon to see people from non-English speaking countries traveling to Ghana to learn English and for their education.

There is also a steady education pipeline between Nigeria and Ghana, in spite of historical ups and downs between both countries.

Faced with a declining education system in their country, many Nigerian parents are opting to send their children to school in Ghana.

Building African talent is one of Ghana's strongest points, and its central location also makes it a great business hub for those who want to expand to Francophone Africa and Africa's largest market - Nigeria.

The proximity to Nigeria yet relative sanity and organization are the main reasons why I moved.

Why Artificial Intelligence in Africa?

Africa's global reputation has suffered over the years for many reasons. Hunger, famine disease, poverty, and foreign aid are things that are typically associated with Africa in people's minds in other continents.

The consistency of conflicts and lousy leadership has also not helped. Artificial Intelligence in Africa seems to be an oxymoron in this context, but Africa is the last frontier.

Africa probably has more secrets about humanity than anywhere else in the world, and it is those secrets that "computer programming that learns and adapts" (which is how Google describes AI) can help to uncover.

Interestingly, some of the best AI talent in the world is already of African origin. They are either working on applied AI projects right from Africa or many other developed markets.

One of those people is Omoju Miller, who has a Ph.D. in Cognition and Study and works at GitHub in San Francisco.

According to Miller: "The African context is very different from Mountain View or Zurich. The kinds of innovation Africa needs is similar to the innovative practices we have seen coming out of China, companies like Alibaba and Ant financial," she said.

"These are companies that are responsible for inventing entire markets that serve the world. That is the kind of innovative thinking we need in Africa. Google AI can play a role in helping us get there," Miller added.

Miller is right; China is not sleeping on AI either. The highest usage of Google's Open source Machine Learning libraries globally come from China.

A lot of innovations are also now being built there with the help of Machine Learning. Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning will not just open up markets but also help to create new ones.

Eric Schmidt in a recent talk mentioned that majority market share models are now much more possible with AI.

It is now Africa's turn to do what China has done. The "African Context" when added to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has the potential of bringing up new solutions for humanity and create new markets.

Google is helping us get there by giving us their full support.
__label__politics (CNN) Lyft is getting some help to get people in underserved communities to the polls this fall.

The ride-sharing company says it's working with community groups to offer free and reduced-price rides on November 6, the date of the midterm elections.

To increase encourage voter turnout, Lyft will offer free rides to people in underserved communities that day by working with Voto Latino, the Urban League and the National Federation of the Blind.

Lyft is also teaming up with Vote.org, Nonprofit Vote, TurboVote and others to give away 50% off promo codes to riders. Riders can get help finding their polling location through the Lyft app.

The company plans to remind riders about voter registration deadlines, give drivers voter registration handouts and offer in-office voter registration to its employees. Lyft will provide online voter information through partner organizations When We All Vote and National Voter Registration Day and encourage people to participate in early voting.

__label__politics (CNN) In the summer of 2013, Aimee Stephens sent her employer a letter explaining she was about to change her life. She was a transgender woman, and she intended to start dressing as such at work.

She never expected then that she was about to enter into a yearslong legal dispute, one that might soon become a litmus test for lesbian, gay and transgender rights before the next US Supreme Court.

Stephens had spent months drafting the message to management at R&G and G&R Harris Funeral Homes, a family-owned business in the Detroit area, she says. She was 52 years old at the time, and she had spent her entire life fighting the knowledge she was a transgender woman, to the point that she had considered ending her life.

Now that she was coming out at work, she hoped her nearly six years of positive performance reviews, which had earned her regular raises, would count in her favor.

But her boss, a devout Christian, told her the situation was "not going to work out," according to court documents. Thomas Rost offered her a severance package when she was fired, but she declined to accept it.

She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor's enforcement agency, and the government sued the funeral home. The department accused the funeral home of firing Stephens for being transgender and for her refusal to conform to sex-based stereotypes.

A district court agreed with the funeral home that the federal workplace discrimination law known as Title VII did not protect transgender people. But it found that the funeral home did discriminate against Stephens for her refusal to conform to its "preferences, expectations, or stereotypes" for women. The EEOC appealed.

The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Stephens and the EEOC in March. The funeral home's lawyers accused the court of exceeding its authority by expanding the definition of sex in a way that threatens to "shift" what it means to be a man or a woman.

In July, lawyers representing the funeral home asked the Supreme Court to take up the case to determine if transgender individuals are protected under Title VII's sex-based provisions. If the court takes up the case, it could have broader implications for the definition of sex-based discrimination. And it could impact case law that precludes firing anyone -- gay, straight or cisgender -- for not adhering to sex-based stereotypes.

"The stakes don't get much higher than being able to keep your job," said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy for the National Center for Transgender Equality. "Harris Funeral Homes is a stark example of the job discrimination that so many transgender people face."

Advocates say it's one of the most important current civil rights issues for the transgender community, along with similar considerations in education and health care . And they say it has been settled by years of case law. In the past two decades, numerous federal courts have ruled that federal sex discrimination laws apply to transgender and gender-nonconforming people, including Title VII, the Title IX education law, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.

But lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative Christian nonprofit representing the funeral home, say it's far from settled.

"No court or federal agency has the authority to rewrite a federal statute. That power belongs solely to Congress. Replacing 'sex' with 'gender identity,' as the 6th Circuit and the EEOC have done, is a dramatic change," senior counsel Jim Campbell said in a statement.

"What it means to be male or female shifts from a biological reality based in anatomy and physiology to a subjective perception. Far-reaching consequences accompany such a transformation."

'Like a punch in the gut'

The case is one of several that could go before the high court raising the question of whether sex includes gender identity for the purpose of Title VII. The question is coming up more often as the transgender community grows more visible, especially in the workplace.

"The most common context in which you see some kind of discrimination is in the workplace," University of Texas professor law and CNN legal analyst Stephen Vladeck said. "This is the context in which there are the most claims that would rise or fall on whether gender identity is equivalent to sex."

Donna Stephens, left, with Aimee Stephens, who has suffered health problems in recent years.

Now 57, Stephens began working in a funeral home in her 20s, preparing bodies for viewing, helping present the deceased in their best light. It was a way for her to bring a measure of comfort to people in their times of greatest need, she said.

She moved to Michigan nearly 20 years ago to be with her wife, and returned to the funeral home industry. She joined Harris Funeral Homes as an apprentice in October 2007 and served as a funeral director/embalmer from April 2008 until her termination in August 2013.

She enjoyed her work, but she struggled with her identity, she says. One day in November 2012, she went out to the backyard of her Redford home with a loaded gun.

"I couldn't see myself going backward or forward," she said. "I buried it as deep as I could for my whole life, but it doesn't stay buried."

Then, she realized she loved herself and her life too much to give up, and went back inside the house, she says.

Her wife, Donna Stephens, says she had noticed a change over time in her spouse. She thought it was depression, or worse, an affair. "When she came out and she told me, it was honestly sort of a relief," she said. "But it was very upsetting to find out the truth of what could have happened."

Stephens had started seeing a counselor who recommended she write the letter for her workplace. She began working on it in early 2013, and hand-delivered it to her co-workers and boss on July 21, 2013.

"I always knew there was a chance they would go off the deep end, but I was really hoping they would be more tolerant of my decision," she said. "Losing my job was like a punch in the gut."

Donna Stephens took on extra jobs after her wife was fired.

Stephens' health began to decline due to kidney failure and she could no longer work. Money became tight and Donna Stephens had to take on extra jobs while she grappled with her spouse's transition. They sold their van, their camper and a piano to make ends meet. A close call with death in fall 2017 renewed her resolve to speak publicly about the case in between appointments with doctors and dialysis sessions.

She's still determined to see her case through. "What they did to me was wrong, and I won't be the last," Aimee Stephens said. "It's important that we treat one another as we would want to be treated. Religious freedom doesn't give you the right to override other people's freedoms."

The case background

In her complaint to the EEOC, Stephens alleged that management said it terminated her because the public would not accept her transition, according to court documents. In a deposition, Rost testified that he fired Stephens because she "was no longer to represent himself as a man" and "wanted to dress as a woman," the court documents said.

The funeral home had a dress code for public-facing employees: suits and ties for men, skirts and business jackets for women. For Rost, who believes the Bible teaches that "sex is immutable," acquiescing to Stephens' proposal would have violated the funeral home's dress code, according to his petition. And Rost was concerned that female employees would have to share the restroom with Stephens, his lawyers claim.

Rost's arguments center on the definition of sex as "a biological reality based in anatomy and physiology," not a "subjective perception evidenced by what people profess they feel." It's a position Alliance Defending Freedom lawyers have held in legal disputes across the country, where the group represents school districts, parent groups and individuals in fights against policies that let transgender individuals use facilities based on their gender identity.

Rost believed "he 'would be violating God's commands' if a male representative of Harris Homes presented himself as a woman while representing the company," his petition says.

What Brett Kavanaugh could mean for the case

Sixteen states filed a brief on August 23 supporting the funeral home, urging the Supreme Court to "restore the balance of power in our federal system." The attorneys general of 13 states and the governors of three others signed, saying states should be the ones to "legislate and experiment in this policy arena."

When Congress enacted Title VII in 1964, according to the brief, "sex" and "gender identity" had different meanings, and Congress has treated them as separate concepts ever since. Several federal statutes include "sex" and "gender identity" as separate traits, but not Title VII.

"Congress clearly knows there is a distinction between sex and gender identity. It has used both terms at the same time (indicating they are not interchangeable), and it has thus far declined to add gender identity to Title VII," the brief says.

"Unless and until Congress affirmatively acts, our Constitution leaves to the states the authority to determine which protections, or not, should flow to individuals based on gender identity. The 6th Circuit ignored this fact and essentially rewrote federal law, engaging in policy experimentation."

It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take the case. But Lambda Legal Staff Attorney Sasha Buchert and other civil rights advocates say they are deeply concerned about the potential outcome, especially if nominee Brett Kavanaugh is on the bench. The court of appeals judge served as associate counsel and then senior associate counsel to the president from 2001 to 2003. While awaiting confirmation for nearly three years, he became assistant and staff secretary to Bush.

What they know about his record on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals suggests he won't be friendly to workers or to the LGBT community, Tobin said. What's more alarming is what they don't know about his time in President George W. Bush's White House, during which the administration fought same-sex marriage, she said. The Senate Judiciary Committee released a portion of documents related to his work in the early 2000s, but none from his time as staff secretary from 2003 to 2006. Tobin and others say the release sheds virtually no new light on his legal thinking or positions on issues.

"What we do know is troubling enough, but the fact that there is such a concerted effort to keep us from seeing his whole record makes you wonder what they don't want us to see," Tobin said.

Under President Obama, the EEOC and the Department of Justice took the position that gender identity and transgender status were protected under federal sex discrimination laws. After President Trump took office, "We knew that the administration's position about protections for transgender people was less secure than the previous one," said Stephens' ACLU lawyer, John Knight.

The DOJ has not filed a brief in the funeral home case.

What's at stake

In March, the 6th Circuit held that the funeral home discriminated against Stephens based on her sex. It also found that the funeral home was not entitled to a religious freedom defense.

In its ruling, the panel cited the 1989 Supreme Court decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. The landmark case involved a female employee who sued after she was passed over for a promotion for being "macho" and told that she should walk, talk and dress "more femininely." The court held that a woman could sue for sex discrimination "even though she was not discriminated against for being a woman per se, but instead for failing to be womanly enough," the 6th Circuit said.

The funeral home's lawyers claimed its sex-specific dress code applied to everyone, not just Stephens. But the 6th Circuit said the question was whether the funeral home could terminate Stephens because she refused to conform to its "notion of her sex," not whether she intended to comply with the dress code.

"Title VII's reference to 'sex' encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, and gender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical gender norms," the 6th Circuit said. "Discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status is necessarily discrimination on the basis of sex."

In addition to Title VII's scope, Rost's lawyers have also asked the court to consider whether employers are prohibited from applying sex-specific policies "according to their employees' sex rather than their gender identity."

Fearing the worst

Advocates say the question could have dramatic implications not only for transgender individuals but for anyone who fails to meet an employer's expectations for how a man or women should appear or behave.

"Being transgender is the very essence of not conforming to gender stereotypes," Buchert said.

"The initial impact is obvious, that it would be extremely harmful for transgender people in the workplace because the holding would specifically focus on gender identity. But it's likely the court could hold broader and define sex discrimination in a myopic and narrow way that would carve out all protections for LGBT workers that have been in place for decades."

Stephens is also wary of the case going to the high court after winning at the court of appeals. The issues at stake are matters of life and death for the transgender community, and she wants people to hear her story, she says. Like others, though, she fears an adverse outcome.

"The 6th Circuit was a great decision on behalf of transgender people and their rights. The court made it clear that you can't use religious beliefs to discriminate against people, and it made clear that we have rights under federal law," she said.

"But what if the court strikes it down? That's a day I can't imagine."

For Chinese photographer Luo Yang, girlhood has a multitude of meanings. But rather than relying on the type of saccharine depictions often used in China to depict young women -- gentle, delicate, and overly feminine -- Luo's ongoing project "Girls" features edgy and alternative subjects who defy stereotype and expectation.

Set against a background of rented apartments, hazy night markets and high-rise balconies, the series invites viewers to think about each woman's story. Sparsely decorated homes hint at struggle, though the subjects' expressions suggest a certain resilience. Some of the young women are photographed with their partners, while others are seen sitting topless on rooftops or smoking at windows.

"My intention (for) the series is to capture and keep the primitive, young state of women, which I think is beautiful," the 34-year-old photographer said in an email interview. "They are all girls, (and) not just in terms of their age. It refers more to a 'girl-like' state of mind."

Dismantling gender stereotypes

So what does girlhood look like to Luo? In one photo, a woman stares unflinchingly into the camera as her head is shaved by a naked man. In the next, taken a year later, the same woman stands naked in front of a window, heavily pregnant, gazing out toward the city.

Other images show young women in a variety of settings: smoking a cigarette amid hanging meat, flashing lace panties on a busy road or roaming Beijing with neon-colored hair. By offering intimate glimpses into her subjects' lives, Luo hopes not only to explore what it means to be a millennial in today's China, but to dismantle gender stereotypes that persist in the country.

The Shenyang-born photographer began "Girls" in her early 20s while studying graphic design at her home city's Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts. A self-professed "confused and lonely youngster," she delved into photography to counter the unease she recalls feeling at that age.

Luo began photographing her classmates and friends as a way to express her "feelings and my inner self." The resulting portraits show women who are strong and self-aware, yet vulnerable, reflecting the struggles of growing up in China.

"In China, there are many traditional definitions and limits for women," Luo said, attributing expectations to those in the country who expect women to be accommodating and dutiful, including parents and friends.

"Instead, I choose to show girls with body hair and buzz cuts because they attract me deeply (and) maybe because of our mutual protest against the mainstream stereotypes of women," said Luo, explaining that she often lets her own body hair grow out.

"Not all (the series' subjects) are completely mainstream types of girl, but most of them are very free and independent, and I see more and more of these girls in China as the times change."

New paths

Individual stories of defiance can be found among the hundreds of subjects featured in "Girls" over the past 11 years. Take, for example, Gelaicuomao, a Tibetan girl living in west China's Qinghai province.

She had plans of leaving her small town to become a fashion designer, though her parents forced her to become a teacher, according to Luo. But Gelaicuomao's portrait shows a defiant young woman with a spiky pixie haircut and hot-pink dress. Luo -- who said that the young woman is moving to Shanghai this year to pursue a career in design -- felt the room light up with her subject's energy.

"I hope the girls around me, as well as myself, can live more freely, more independently and chase their dreams," Luo said, "and that my photos might provide them with a certain amount of encouragement and praise to do so."
__label__world EMPLOYED BY CHINA It’s often assumed that the Chinese in Africa ‘bring their own’ and don’t hire locals. In Ethiopia, that’s not the case -- but will it lift the country out of poverty? Words, video and images by Jenni Marsh, CNN

The assembly line at Huajian International Shoe City, Addis Ababa.

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — Zhang Huarong points out of his office window to a bleak block of grey portacabins at the Huajian International Shoe City, in Addis Ababa. “That is what I lived in for six months when I came to Africa,” he says. “I am 60 years old. Back in China, I am a wealthy man -- my house in Dongguan even has a swimming pool. But I chose to come here and do something very difficult.” In 2011, this self-made textile tycoon from Jiangxi province became one of the first Chinese entrepreneurs to heed the call of Ethiopia’s then-Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to open a factory in his country. Within three months, Huajian was producing footwear for giants such as Nine West, Guess and, later, Ivanka Trump’s fashion line, before it closed. “This is something God is telling me to do,” Zhang (pictured below) says, framing himself as a 21st-century manufacturing missionary whose goal is to create more than 100,000 jobs in the poorest parts of Africa. Rwanda is next. “In China, no one wants to make shoes anymore,” he adds. Ethiopia is undoubtedly one of the continent’s poorest countries, but that’s changing. In the decade leading up to 2016, Ethiopia’s economy swelled 10% a year making it the fastest growing in Africa. And with 100 million people, 70% of whom are under age 30, it also has the continent’s second-largest population. That’s both a massive demographic dividend and a real risk: with unemployment at 16.8%, jobs are urgently required. Businessmen like Zhang are seen as the country’s ticket out of poverty. Huajian employs 7,500 local workers at its two enormous factories in the Addis Ababa region. “As long as they have the right skills and training, Africans are just like Asians and Europeans,” he says. Huajian makes shoes exclusively for American clients. As one of the biggest Chinese employers in Ethiopia, Huajian has attracted intense scrutiny. Reports last year of poor working conditions at the firm’s Guangdong factory, in China, and rock bottom wages in Addis Ababa saw two customers, one of whom was Trump, jump ship. While many of the criticisms were valid, Huajian is operating in an environment of deep Western suspicion of the Chinese in Africa. In March, Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state, told leaders at the African Union, in Addis Ababa, that Chinese investors “do not bring significant job creation locally.” His comments echoed warnings about neo-colonialism in Africa and Chinese labor importation by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, respectively. “China is a rising economy, and it’s going to be the global number one by 2030 latest,” says Arkebe Oqubay, a senior government official and architect of much of Ethiopia’s industrialization strategy. “There’s always rivalry when a great power diminishes. But we as the Africans are the ones to say if we are benefiting from China. We don’t need a witness.”

About 4,000 Ethiopian workers are employed at the Huajian International Shoe City, Addis Ababa.

‘Even my father doesn’t like being a farmer’ When Emaway Gashaw was 18 years old, she got on a bus and waved goodbye to her large family of coffee farmers. The journey from Jimma, in western Ethiopia, to Addis Ababa took 10 hours. She wound up in Jemo, a suburb of the capital that a decade ago was countryside but today is dotted by concrete condos housing rural migrants looking for work, including her elder cousin. “When I got here, I didn’t have any opportunities so I took this job,” she says. Emaway is a leather skiver at the Huajian International Light Industry City, a 1.5 million-square-meter industrial park that, will eventually provide housing, hospitals and schooling onsite, employ 100,000 workers, and within 10 years create $4 billion in revenue, according to the company. The Jemo area of Addis Ababa is becoming increasingly urban. From 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., Emaway forms part of a sprawling assembly line inside a brightly lit, air-conditioned shed that looks like a giant aircraft hangar. But her wages allow for little. “I get paid 1,200 birr ($44) a month with overtime,” she says. “After rent and food, there is nothing left. My cousin has to support me.” Emaway is one of the lowest-paid workers at the factory. Getachew Tilanun, 20, is from a family of maize farmers in Welega, where Ethiopia borders South Sudan in the west. After working at the factory for two years, he has been promoted twice and now earns 2,500 birr (about $90) a month, and receives three meals a day and the chance to live onsite for subsidized rent. Unlike 90% of International Labour Organization member states, Ethiopia has no minimum wage. The international poverty line is about $57 a month. Emaway Gashaw, 18 years old, has worked at Huajian for nine months. “For my wage, I have a lot of responsibility,” he says, explaining that he oversees 100 workers, including 11 line supervisors. “If they make mistakes, my wages get docked.” Getachew has taught himself to speak Chinese to give himself “unique” employment skills. “I tried to find out everything I could about China on the internet,” he says. “When I saw Asian people, I just tried to speak to them.” His work is tough, but the alternative is worse. “Even my father doesn’t like being a farmer,” Getachew says. “It’s the job of the very uneducated.” Just 1% of the 4,000 workers at the Jemo factory are Chinese, says Bonn Liang, a manager who was headhunted from Dongguan one year ago. "But in the future, we will all go back to China,” he adds. That’s already happened at the Sino-Ethiop Associate pharmaceutical factory in Dukem, south of Addis. A joint venture between two Chinese and one Ethiopian firm, the facility has 177 employees, only one of whom is Chinese. “In our first year, some Ethiopian workers were sent to China for training, and about 50 Chinese experts came here,” says Andrew Shegaw, the factory manager. “Now we are 100% independent.” The factory employs Ethiopian pharmacists, engineers, and electricians, who received workplace training from the Chinese to supplement their academic knowledge. A worker at the Sino-Ethiop Associate pharmaceutical factory in Dukem. Contrary to popular belief, these scenarios are not unusual. A groundbreaking McKinsey report last year, which surveyed more than 1,000 Chinese companies in construction, manufacturing, trade, real estate, and services in eight African countries, including Ethiopia, found that on average 89% of employees were African. Several million African jobs had been created by China on the continent. Nearly two-thirds of Chinese companies provided skills training, while half offered apprenticeships, and a third had introduced a new technology. It was the first time a large-scale dataset on Chinese hiring practices in Africa had been made available, and it rebutted the criticisms voiced by Tillerson. “I believe that (his claim) was very short-sighted,” Arkebe says. “It’s hard to believe a secretary of state was misinformed.”
__label__politics Washington (CNN) As the nation mourns the death of John McCain, Arizona's Republican governor must soon decide who will replace him in the Senate.

Under Arizona law, it's up to Gov. Doug Ducey to fill Senate vacancies until a special election is held in 2020. He said in a statement that he would not name a successor until after McCain was buried later this week.

"Now is a time for remembering and honoring a consequential life well lived," Ducey said in the statement.

In the year since McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer, Ducey -- who faces a tough re-election race this year -- has refused to talk about who he might appoint to the seat.

Now required to fill the vacancy, Ducey faces major questions that could steer his decision. Among them: Will he seek a placeholder who won't run for re-election in 2020? And did McCain indicate who he'd like to fill the job?

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Just after midnight on Sunday night, the flag flying above the White House was hoisted back to full staff.

Since Saturday evening, it had been positioned at half-staff to mark the death of Sen. John McCain, the former Vietnam prisoner of war and onetime Republican nominee for President. His death had sparked an outpouring of tributes from across the political spectrum, except at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. President Donald Trump initially tweeted condolences for McCain's family but did not praise the senator specifically. On Monday afternoon, he issued a statement saying, "Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country. "

Earlier Monday, the White House flag had returned to its regular position even as other flags around Washington -- including at the US Capitol -- remained in the half-staff mourning position.

But on Monday afternoon, the White House once again lowered the flag to half-staff and Trump, in his statement said he "signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment."

The contrast earlier in the day offered the latest reminder of the animosity that Trump has maintained for McCain, even after his passing.

__label__politics Story highlights The commission ceased all collection efforts earlier this month

But at least one other lawsuit remains pending in federal court in New York

(CNN) A federal judge in DC declined to block President Donald Trump's voter integrity commission from collecting data on voters from 50 states in a ruling on Monday, handing a win to an administration inundated by lawsuits over the commission's request.

The commission's vice chairman, Kris Kobach, sent a letter to all 50 states requesting a slew of voter roll data in late June. Kobach said he was only asking for what was publicly available under the laws of each state, but the request nevertheless triggered rapid-fire litigation in federal courts, including a suit by a privacy rights group in which claimed the commission had failed to comply with federal law and the request violated constitutionally-protected privacy rights.

The commission ceased all collection efforts earlier this month and opted to switch from using a Defense Department website to host the voter data to having it maintained by an existing system within the White House.

US District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly concluded Monday that the Electronic Privacy Information Center did not have standing to sue on all of its claims under existing case law.

"Under these factual circumstances ... the only practical harm that plaintiff's advisory board members would suffer, assuming their respective states decide to comply with the commission's request in the future, is that their already publicly available information would be rendered more easily accessible by virtue of its consolidation on the computer systems that would ultimately receive this information on behalf of the Commission," Kollar-Kotelly wrote. "At most, plaintiff has shown that its members will suffer an increased risk of harm if their already publicly available information is collected by the commission."

__label__politics Story highlights He says the Russia hacking is not a partisan issue

He believes Clinton would have still lost the election

Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday his campaign email account was hacked by Russians -- adding that the US needs to work together to stop this from happening.

"I do believe the Russians hacked into the (Democratic National Committee). I do believe they hacked into (John) Podesta's email account. They hacked into my campaign account," he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." "I do believe that all the information released publicly hurt Clinton and didn't hurt Trump. I don't think the outcome of the election is in doubt. What we should do is not turn on each other but work as one people to push back on Russia."

He added he doesn't believe that the hacking affected the elections.

"I think Hillary Clinton lost because she wasn't an agent of change and she tried to disqualify Trump and she wasn't able to do it," he said. "This is not a Republican or Democratic issue."

"They're trying to destabilize democracy all over the world. Not just here," he said about the Russians. "Here's what we should do. We should tell the Russians that on no uncertain terms, you interfere in our elections, we don't care why, we're going to hit you and hit you hard, we're going to introduce sanctions, it'll to be bipartisan."

__label__world Fadi Hakura is a Turkey expert and associate fellow at Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, an independent policy institute based in London. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

Turkey's national currency, the lira, has tumbled by nearly 40% against the US dollar so far this year.

Relations between the two countries reached a low point on Friday, as US President Donald Trump approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium in response to Turkey's refusal to release Andrew Brunson -- an American pastor who is under house arrest in Turkey and facing terror charges.

Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has so far resisted pressure to implement monetary and fiscal orthodoxy, choosing instead to lash out at both the financial markets and the US.

He has suggested that there is a global plot that aims to destroy Turkey's political and economic achievements.

So far, his domestic popularity has been on the rise, as he taps into the anti-US sentiment (and willingness to believe in conspiracy theories) that exists among much of the Turkish population.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) One week ago, Paul Manafort learned from a federal jury that he had been found guilty.

But the verdict in his criminal trial in Alexandria, Virginia, was only a halfway point in his defense against special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Tuesday morning, Manafort's defense lawyers will be back in court, this time focused on securing some preliminary terms for a second criminal trial, set to begin Sept. 17 in Washington.

Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, won't be in court in person. He cited "the time it takes for the US Marshal Service to transport me to and from the courthouse" as his reason for skipping. Manafort is being held in an Alexandria jail as he awaits his trial about 10 miles away in DC.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson plans to address a few minor issues in Manafort's case, such as how much the prosecutors can discuss issues related to Ukrainian law, Manafort's mortgage applications and other loans during the trial. The loan issues became key parts of prosecutors' case against Manafort at his previous trial.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The decision by President Donald Trump's legal team to allow White House counsel Don McGahn to talk to special counsel Robert Mueller without restrictions was made in part because the lawyers calculated they did not have a good legal standing to prevent it and because it fit with the strategy to be cooperative with the investigation, according to sources who sought to explain McGahn's extensive interviews.

The sources said that even though McGahn has talked to special counsel investigators -- for some 30 hours -- the Trump administration could still seek to prevent details of the testimony from being released publicly by asserting executive privilege on relevant elements of the report.

McGahn's lawyers believe his cooperation includes any potential grand jury inquiry, a source familiar with the matter said, but it stops there and blocks Congress or any civil litigators from gaining access to the information. That was the White House posture for former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who spoke with Mueller's team but used executive privilege to shield himself from answering certain questions posed by congressional investigators.

McGahn has not been asked to go to the grand jury, according to the same source, but the Trump legal team thinks there would be a resistance.

"There would be a battle over the use of McGahn's information," one source said, explaining that McGahn was allowed to speak with Mueller with privilege remaining in place over the use of the information.

__label__politics Boston (CNN) A Boston federal judge could rule as early as Thursday whether to order the Department of Homeland Security to stop arresting undocumented immigrants who come to government offices for interviews as part of the first steps in applying for green cards.

US District Judge Mark Wolf heard testimony Tuesday from people who had been unexpectedly detained when they sat for marriage interviews as part of the application process to prove that their marriages to US citizens were legitimate.

Emails entered as evidence in the case show what appear to be efforts between US Citizenship and Immigration Services employees and Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to coordinate the interview appointments and arrests.

There are five couples named in the suit, each consisting of an undocumented immigrant married to a US citizen, and attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union say there are other couples in the New England area who are facing similar situations. While the ACLU and attorneys at the firm WilmerHale have asked for the injunction to apply to the Boston ICE office's region, the impact could be felt nationwide.

"The reason that these arrests happened according to ICE itself is President Trump's (January 2017) executive order -- and that is an executive order that is nationwide," said Matt Segal, an ACLU attorney. "The issue in this case is one that is important for the entire country."

Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that the practice of arresting immigrants with deportation orders who are attempting to apply for green cards goes against their own agency's 2013 policy of creating "provisional waivers," which were created to allow people in those situations who have US citizen family members the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents.

Wolf previously ordered the release of each of the spouses who had been detained and are named in this case. He indicated a ruling could come Thursday.

ICE officials testified that they believe the arrests were justified, citing the executive order calling for "the faithful execution of immigration laws of the United States ... against all removable aliens..."

The current acting field office director, Todd Lyons, said in court that he would prioritize people who have criminal histories for removal.

"We still are following the executive order, but I have the daunting task of doing it with the resources we have," Lyons said in testimony. "The public safety aspect far outweighs the resources that we have."

Separating families thousands of miles from the border

In the months since Lilian Calderon, 30, returned to her Rhode Island home after being unexpectedly detained for nearly a month, her two young children, Natalie, 5, and Noah, 2, have not been the same.

Natalie had nightmares of Calderon not being there, screaming for "Mommy" in the middle of the night, her mother said. Noah would latch on to Calderon's legs when she needed to do something as simple as go to the bathroom, and it would take her nearly half an hour to calm him down.

"He developed a separation anxiety that he didn't have before," Calderon said in court.

Calderon's husband, Luis Gordillo, one of the strongest men she knows, has changed, she said, developing depression and anxiety because of the uncertainty of their family's situation. They have known each other since 2002 and were married in 2016.

"It's hard for me to see this man that always takes care of us, when he breaks down because a court date is looming," Calderon said.

Calderon revealed these changes in court before Wolf, who wanted to know what "irreparable harm" she and others in her situation would face if he did not issue a preliminary injunction, stopping DHS from arresting and possibly deporting others like her.

The family's life was turned upside down in January, when Calderon and Gordillo went into a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office for a marriage interview. The interview is part of the process of filing for an I-130 application, the first step a US citizen takes to help a noncitizen relative immigrate to the US.

Calderon was brought to the US by her parents from Guatemala when she was 3 years old. She has been subject to a final order of removal since her father's asylum application was denied when she was 15.

If she is sent back to Guatemala, her husband says, she would be sent back to a country she knows nothing about.

"Natalie doesn't even speak Spanish. Our little one doesn't either. We don't have any family, we don't have any roots over there," Gordillo testified.

When asked if Calderon could go live in Guatemala while her husband and children remain in the US, both husband and wife said it is a possibility they have not wanted to think about.

"Just the four weeks that she was detained -- that was very harmful for the family," Gordillo said.

Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to a request for comment.

A policy change

Since February there have been five changes in field office directors at the Boston ICE office, and each has his or her own interpretation of how to handle situations like Calderon's, which is part of the reason why Wolf said he would direct a preliminary injunction, should he choose to order one, specifically to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Lyons, who was named to the post on Monday, also served in the position briefly in June. Evidence presented in court showed that arrests of undocumented immigrants who arrived at the Boston-area USCIS office for marriage interviews began in July 2017, and Lyons confirmed that these started happening at the request of USCIS.

"We continue to receive CIS referrals," Lyons said. "But each case is reviewed on a case-by-case basis."

The opinions expressed here are his own.

(CNN) Every year since 1978, May has been commemorated as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month -- the official, federally designated period for the nation's 20 million residents of Asian descent. President Jimmy Carter first proclaimed it as such.

However, this year's celebration is unique. That's because May 2018 quietly marks our golden anniversary: the 50th birthday of "Asian-American."

And as far as we Asian-Americans have come over this past half-century, it's time to figure out who we are.

Of course, the history of Asians in America goes back further than 50 years -- hundreds of years in fact. The arrival of Asian immigrants to what would eventually be called America can be traced back to 1587. That's when a group of "Luzon Indians" from the Philippines, sailing on a Spanish galleon, disembarked in Morro Bay, California.

Later, in 1763, Filipinos would establish the first permanent Asian enclave in the Americas, the town of St. Malo in Louisiana. A century later, the first mass waves of migration from Asia to the United States would begin as Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos and Indians arrived in vast numbers to work the plantations of Hawaii and the gold mines and railroads of the continental West.

But these are all markers of arrival, not shared identity. These early sojourners and settlers may have lived and worked side by side, socialized with another, even intermarried; nevertheless, they saw themselves through the lens of separate ethnicities and national origins.

Early immigrant Asian groups considered themselves as different from one another as they were from the white majority around them, with discrete languages, customs and cultural traditions, and in some cases, histories of prejudice or mutual hostility. During World War II, when Japanese-Americans were showered with hostility and eventually, unconstitutionally incarcerated by the US government, some Chinese even wore buttons stating, "I am Chinese," to avoid being accidentally targeted by the hysteria.

That sense of separateness was defiantly challenged 50 years ago this month, by a group of young activists whose gathering in a cramped Bay Area apartment ended up transforming the course of a community.

Back then Yuji Ichioka, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, and Emma Gee scoured a published roster of fellow students who had protested against the conflict in Vietnam and contacted every individual with an Asian-sounding last name, inviting them to become charter members of a new organization: the Asian American Political Alliance.

It would be the first public use of the coinage "Asian American" -- inspired by the term "Afro-American" adopted by black activists of the era -- as an umbrella term for Americans with roots or origins in the continent of Asia. As the name of the group implied, it was an explicitly political statement, stating in essence: We are united by our status as Americans, yes, but we are also claiming a new identity, nominally rooted in geographic origins, but more accurately anchored in our common desire for empowerment, for a united voice of protest, for social change.

Both the term and the idea behind it, that the diverse array of Asians in the United States should be seen as an amalgamated entity -- a race -- rapidly gained momentum. In 1977, the federal Office of Management and Budget formally directed that aggregate statistics should be gathered on "Asians and Pacific Islanders," which led to Asian-Americans being rescued from the undifferentiated category of "Other" in the 1980 US census.

Since then, individual Asian-Americans have increasingly risen into positions of visible prominence and influence.

This month, a group of notable Asian-American business, media and technology leaders, called Gold House , gathered a panel of Asian and non-Asian celebrity judges -- including Olympians Apolo Anton Ohno and Michelle Kwan, Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang, Ogilvy & Mather co-chair Khai Meng Tham, super-producer Pharrell Williams, GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis and Hidden Figures producer Mimi Valdes -- to select and release the A100, a list of the 100 most influential Asian-Americans in our contemporary culture.

Looking at the list is eye-opening. In media and entertainment, the co-head and COO of Amazon Studios, Albert Cheng, is named, alongside Netflix's vice president of original documentary and comedy, Lisa Nishimura; Disney's executive vice president of worldwide production, Susette Hsiung; and the president of DC Films, Walter Hamada. The list also features actors such as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Mindy Kaling, Constance Wu and Aziz Ansari.

The business and tech sections included venture capitalists such as Cowboy Ventures founder Aileen Lee; corporate heads such as SC Johnson's global chief marketing officer Ann Mukherjee, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google CEO Sundar Pichai; Katrina Lake, the founder of Stitch Fix, an online subscription and personal shopping site; and Chieh Huang, founder of Boxed, an online warehouse. In lifestyle and sports, there's snowboarder Chloe Kim and skater Nathan Chen, restaurateur David Chang and social media superstar Chrissy Teigen.

It's a staggering array of talent and achievement.

But it's also an overt challenge to Asian-Americans, a community that I described back in 2012 as "very much in beta, and still working out the compatibility issues that come with a rapidly growing and wildly varied installed base."

That is because the individual achievements and collective emergence of Asians in the United States can easily paper over the very real issues we face. Anti-immigrant rhetoric increasingly targets new arrivals. The flames of hysteria continue to be fanned against Muslims and those who are simply perceived to be Muslim. National rivalry -- in some political quarters -- with China, and fear of North Korea fuel xenophobic hate. The wealth and privilege of some in our community hide the poverty and isolation of others.

Age 50 is when one must truly put away the idle excuses of youth, and stare the reality of one's past achievements, present resources and future responsibilities in the face.

It's time for Asian-Americans to come out of beta, and define who we are and where we stand. Will it be with those who are building a better world, or those who are focused on personal enrichment? With those who fight for the needs of the underrepresented, or those who indulge the whims of the entitled? With those who speak truth to power, or those who excuse the lies of the powerful?

Many on the A100 roster, and many who are reading this essay, will be around to see our community's centennial. Let's hope that over the next 50 years, we will answer these questions -- and in ways that will allow us to look back on our first century with pride.
__label__world (CNN) Tens of thousands of refugees are trapped on the border into Bangladesh without basic food and medicine amid operations by the Myanmar military, which have already killed hundreds.

Satellite photos released by Human Rights Watch Saturday showed what they are desperate to escape -- entire villages torched to the ground in clashes between Myanmar's armed forces and local militants.

More than 73,000 Rohingyas have now fled across the border since August 25, the United Nations said Sunday.

But in northern Rakhine State there are reports of at least another 30,000 Rohingyas trapped in hilly terrain without basic supplies of food, water or medicine, according to activists.

The Rohingya, a Muslim minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, are considered some of the most persecuted people in the world. Myanmar, also known as Burma, considers them Bangladeshi and Bangladesh says they're Burmese.

It is the second time in less than a year that a military crackdown has led to a mass exodus.

Rohingya refugees travel on an open-back truck near Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya, Bangladesh, on September 3.

Stranded

Unable to cross the Naf river into Bangladesh and fearful to return to what's left of their homes, Rohingya activists say the refugees are stranded between Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships.

Videos provided to CNN by activists show dozens of men, women and children stranded on a mountain, surrounded by dense jungle, living in makeshift shelters made of sticks and sheets.

"The human lives that are most vulnerable must be rescued immediately without delay," executive director of Burma Human Rights Network, Kyaw Win, said in a statement.

The trapped refugees are just some of at least 100,000 Rohingyas who have been forced to flee their homes since August 25, after armed forces began "clearance operations" across Rakhine State

The government blames "terrorists" for starting the violence. Rohingya militants killed 12 security officers in border post attacks two weeks ago, according to state media, intensifying the latest crackdown.

A top military official said the government was "taking great care in solving the (Rakhine State) problem."

Due to Myanmar's policy of shutting off all access to Rakhine state for the media, CNN is not able to verify any figures independently or any stories told by refugees.

Village burnt down

Human Rights Watch renewed its calls for the Myanmar government to allow independent observers into Rakhine State, after releasing troubling satellite photos from inside the region.

"This new satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a Muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of destruction in northern Rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought," Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said in a statement.

The images were taken on August 31 of Chein Khar Li village in northern Rakhine State. According to Human Rights Watch, they show about 700 buildings have been burned down, making up about 99% of the village.

Images obtained by Human Rights Watch which allegedly show the complete destruction of the Rakhine State village of Chein Khar Li.

"This is only one of 17 sites that we've located where burnings have taken place," Robertson said.

Myanmar's government has blamed the most recent violence and property destruction on Rohingya extremists.

'Hacking our people to death'

The Rohingya have long been persecuted by the Myanmar government. Despite living in the country for generations, they've been denied citizenship and are regularly harassed.

A separate outbreak of violence in 2016 saw 85,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border, bringing with them horrifying stories of rape, torture and murder inside Rakhine State

Some refugees who poured across the border into Bangladesh told CNN what they had witnessed since the latest crackdown began two weeks ago.

"They are beating us, shooting at us and hacking our people to death," Hamida Begum, a refugee who has left everything behind, told CNN.

"Many people were killed. Many women were raped and killed. We are very poor."

Top general: Military 'solving the problem'

On Saturday, a top Myanmar general issued an defiant statement on the violence in Rakhine State.

Posted to his Facebook page, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said the only action been taken against "Bengalis" was "to ensure everything is within the framework of the law."

JUST WATCHED Thousands of Rohingya flee violence in Myanmar Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Thousands of Rohingya flee violence in Myanmar 01:35

"The Bengali problem was a long-standing one which has become an unfinished job despite the efforts of the previous governments to solve it," he said.

"The government in office is taking great care in solving the problem."

In his post, Gen. Hlaing didn't address protests made by Bangladesh alleging Myanmar's military had violated their airspace on multiple occasions in the past week.

In a note sent to Myanmar's embassy in Dhaka on Friday, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs "strongly protested" the incursions and warned it could lead "to an unwarranted situation."

"Bangladesh demanded Myanmar take immediate measures to prevent recurrence of such incursion in the future," a statement posted to the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry's website said.

International condemnation grows

On Sunday night, Indonesia's minister for Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi flew to Myanmar to request the government cease all violence against the Muslim Rohingya minority.

Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced the move in a statement , condemning the attacks and demanding real action to help the Rohingyas. Indonesia is the largest Muslim majority country in the world.

Nobel laureate Malala has called out Myanmar's state councilor and defacto leader Aung San Suu Kyi over the violence, saying in a statement she was still waiting for her fellow Nobel Winner to join her in condemning the treatment of Rohingyas.

"Every time I see the news, my heart breaks at the suffering of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar," she wrote.

Qatar foreign minister Al Thani said his country "strongly condemn(ed) attacks on Rohingya Muslims during Eid," calling on the country to follow international laws.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton used Labor Day to target Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's record on worker rights and unions, arguing that "workers' rights would suffer" if the DC appellate judge were confirmed to the nation's highest court.

"With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people," Clinton tweeted on Monday.

She argued that the 53-year-old conservative judge joining the bench would result in "widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers."

"Kavanaugh's record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows he'd help further that trend for a generation," she wrote.

Happy Labor Day. There's no better time to talk about why workers' rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 3, 2018

She pointed to Kavanaugh's opinion in the AFL-CIO v. Gates case, which she argued "severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers' ability to bargain collectively."

__label__world (CNN) In one corner is Bobi Wine, the charismatic and wildly popular musician, affectionately known in Uganda as 'the Ghetto President.'

In the other is the real President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, who -- like many of Africa's former revolutionaries -- has clung to power for decades, amid growing calls for him to step down.

Museveni, 73, has ruled the east African nation with an iron fist since he took power in 1986 and is not known to be soft on his opponents; he has seen off many of them in his 32-year rule.

But some commentators are saying that Wine -- with his musical and political clout as well as a solid youth base -- is the real challenger to Museveni's throne.

"Bobi Wine poses a real threat to Museveni, more so in consideration that young Ugandans, many of whom are unemployed, constitute a huge percentage of the active electorate," says Jimmy Spire Ssentongo, an Associate Dean at Uganda Martyrs University.

"Given the widespread public desperation in Uganda, all many people want is a person who shows the potential of removing Museveni. All else is secondary," he said in an interview with The Conversation

Before he was Bobi Wine, the musician was known as Robert Kyagulanyi. He grew up in the slums of Uganda, raised by a single mother, but turned to music as a way out of grinding poverty.

His upbeat dancehall music style and catchy lyrics dominated airwaves and clubs across East Africa from the early 2000s.

Singing frequently in his native Luganda, the songs contained strong messages, often railing against social injustice in the country.

He called on the citizenry to "rise up and raise their voices" to challenge oppression.

"Don't shy away from working for Uganda, because it is your own country, even if your boss was not your choice. Just play your part, because this is your country," he sang in one of his hits, " Situka.

With such politically conscious lyrics, a career in politics was, perhaps, inevitable.

In 2017, he stood for Parliament as an independent, campaigning on the catchphrase : "Since Parliament has failed to come to the ghetto, then we shall bring the ghetto to Parliament."

He was elected by a landslide and has since proved to be a thorn in Museveni's side, pitching his tent with opposition legislators and continuing to make music, mostly critical of the President's long-term rule.

His popularity has not gone unnoticed by the government.

Some of his songs, including "Freedom," have been banned in the country.

"See our leaders become misleaders," Wine sang. "And see our mentors become tormentors. Freedom fighters become dictators. They look upon the youth and say we're destructors."

Bobi Wine, 36, was a toddler when Museveni came to power.

A former defense minister, Museveni had formed a political party that would go on to overthrow the brutal Idi Amin dictatorship in 1979.

Uganda has one of the youngest populations in the world; more than three-quarters of the country's 35.6 million people are below the age of 30.

According to the International Labor Organization , young people form 83% of the unemployed in Uganda.

Many are frustrated and long for opportunities that will lift them out of poverty.

President for life?

Once revered for unseating one of Africa's most brutal leaders, Museveni himself now runs the risk of becoming a dictator.

He has changed the constitution twice to extend his stay in office. In 2005, legislators removed presidential term limits to allow him to stand for elections.

A bill was also passed last year eliminating constitutional limits on anyone serving as president past the age of 75, paving the way for Museveni to become president for life.

When it was debated in Parliament, Wine joined opposition MPs to shut down the law.

He said in a Facebook post that it was time for Museveni to release his firm grip over the nation.

"Ugandans made it clear long ago that they are opposed to a life presidency," he wrote. "They don't want the constitution tampered with in any way."

Arguments during the presidential age limit debate descended into chaos as lawmakers exchanged punches and threw chairs at each other in Parliament.

The amendment also sparked protests among students and activists.

#FreeBobiWine

Wine has used his star power and political office to galvanize Uganda's youth to take action against unpopular policies.

When the President introduced a controversial social media tax earlier this year, Wine led a protest march to Uganda's Parliament to demand a review.

However, he is not without controversy. In 2014, the pop star was forced to cancel a UK tour after he was denied entry into Britain following protests from gay activists who accused him of promoting homophobic lyrics, according to the UK Guardian

He later wrote: "I am personally not out to threaten the life of any individual based on their sexual orientation, I just do not agree with them (homosexuals)," he said. "This is my opinion and happens to be that of 99% of Ugandans," the newspaper reported.

Following his arrest and alleged torture, Wine has gained global prominence and sparked an international protest movement.

The lawmaker was arrested on August 15 alongside opposition MPs after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election.

Wine said on Twitter that his driver was shot dead. Police said Museveni's car was attacked in the aftermath of the violence.

The public has reacted to the recent events with outrage and anger, most of it channeled through social media.

From Tokyo to Washington, activists and fans joined the #FreeBobiWine hashtag online and took to the streets to demand the singer's release.

Activists and civil society groups marched to the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on August 23 to protest against Wine's detention.

Influential figures in the music industry, including Chris Martin, Angelique Kidjo, Damon Albarn and others, also joined the campaign.

Thousands of Kenyans marched to the country's Parliament and the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi to hand over a petition for the singer's release.

'A brutal regime'

Kampala's Mayor, Erias Lukwago, told CNN Wine's arrest has exposed Museveni's "brutal regime."

"The level of injustice in Uganda is too much; this brutal regime wants to suppress opposing voices. But they must know that Ugandans are angry, and they will no longer tolerate any form of oppression," Lukwago, who is also on Wine's legal team, said.

The singer, now facing treason charges, was taken into military detention following his arrest. He posted a lengthy statement Monday detailing the physical abuse he says he suffered at the hands of the military during and after his arrest last month.

Wine, who is seeking treatment in the United States, claims to have been beaten with an iron bar, punched, kicked, hit with pistol butts and had his ears pulled with "something like pliers."

"After some time, I could almost no longer feel the pain. I could only hear what they were doing from afar. My cries and pleas went unheeded. The things they were speaking to me all this while, I cannot reproduce here. Up to now, I cannot understand how these soldiers who I probably had never met before in person could hate me so much," Wine says in the statement.

Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told CNN the allegations are being investigated.

"There are allegations -- they are alleging that they were tortured by security forces. There is already a case file open to investigating their allegations of torture, so the allegations of torture has also to be proven by medical examinations. I cannot believe what they're saying unless the medical personnel confirm to us that they were indeed tortured. Until the medical team from the government ascertain or confirms to us that they were tortured that's when I can say they were," he said.

Museveni also took to his blog and social media to dismiss the torture allegations as "fake news."

He accused Wine and the arrested MPs of intimidating voters.

"Anybody who is a friend of the young politicians like Bobi Wine should advise them that shortcuts like cheating, importing voters, intimidating the voters of the other side, ballot stuffing... will lead them and Uganda to doom," Museveni said.

Clinging to power

While much of the developed world embraces the energy of youth in leadership positions, it is not often the case in Africa.

From Uganda to Cameroon, many of the continent's leaders are aging and clinging to power while their countries struggle to keep pace with global developments.

Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was forced to relinquish power in 2017 after 37 years of autocratic rule. The 94-year-old had ruled the country since its independence in 1980.

Cameroon's Paul Biya, 85, has been President since 1982 and plans to stand again for election in October, amid spiraling violence and alleged human rights abuses in the country.

It is no wonder young politicians like Wine attract a strong and loyal following when they go up against these regimes.

But Wine is quick to reject notions that he is a messianic figure who will topple Museveni's long-standing regime.

I have said it before that any party that tells you that it can single handedly liberate Uganda is a jocker. For us to defeat President Museveni, it will take more than one political party, more than one tribe, more than one religion and yes, more than one generation. pic.twitter.com/ipyuZYUGkV — BOBI WINE (@HEBobiwine) August 12, 2018

As he puts it in a recent tweet: "I have said it before that any party that tells you that it can single handedly liberate Uganda is a jocker (sic). For us to defeat President Museveni, it will take more than one political party, more than one tribe, more than one religion and yes, more than one generation."
__label__world Philadelphia (CNN) Passengers aboard a Dallas-bound Southwest Airlines flight Tuesday struggled to pull a woman back into the plane after she was sucked into a hole left by a shattered window, witnesses said.

The woman died, officials said.

The woman was sitting on the left side of the plane when something in the engine apparently broke and smacked into the window. She hung out the hole for many minutes, said Hollie Mackey, who sat next to the victim, and Amy Serafini, who was in the row behind the woman.

Many passengers kept trying to pull the woman back into the plane for a long time, until two men were able to get the woman back in her seat, they said.

A nurse answered a call for help and tried to do CPR.

Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board got a preliminary look at the engine that failed.

One of 24 fan blades was missing, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said in Philadelphia.

Sumwalt said a first look showed there was evidence of metal fatigue where the blade attached to a hub.

A National Transportation Safety Board investigator examines the damaged engine.

Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the family of the victim was the airline's primary concern.

"This is a sad day and our hearts go out to the family and the loved ones of the deceased customer," he said. "We will do all that we can to support them during this very difficult time."

The woman who was killed was identified as Jennifer Riordan, according to CNN affiliate KOAT , which cited Annunciation Catholic School. Riordan, 43, worked for Wells Fargo in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the station reported.

Terror in the cabin

"Everybody was going crazy, and yelling and screaming," passenger Marty Martinez said of the flight, which left New York and was forced to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia.

"As the plane is going down, I am literally purchasing internet just so I can get some kind of communication to the outside world," he said.

Passenger Matt Tranchin told CNN affiliate WPVI he was thinking, "That I'll never live to see my son born. That I'll never be able to say goodbye to my wife, say goodbye to parents. But I am. I am. I feel really very fortunate for that."

Tranchin told WPVI the crew was frantically trying to plug a hole left when a window shattered.

"Flight attendants rushed up. There was momentary chaos. Everyone kind of descended on where this hole was," he said.

The plane had suffered damage to one of its engines, and according to passenger Kristopher Johnson, who was sitting near the front of Flight 1380, debris from the engine flew into the window, breaking it and injuring a woman sitting nearby.

"Shrapnel hit the window causing a serious injury. No other details about that. Several medical personnel on the flight tended to the injured passenger," Johnson said.

The crew reported damage to one of the aircraft's engines as well as the fuselage and a window, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

The injured woman's arms and body were sucked toward the opening in the plane, Martinez recalled in a phone interview. Objects flew out the hole where the window had been, and "passengers right next to her were holding onto her. And meanwhile, there was blood all over this man's hands. He was tending to her," said Martinez, who was sitting a row or two away from the woman.

Other passengers began trying to plug the hole with jackets and other objects but to no avail. Those items, too, were sucked out of the plane, he said.

Martinez said he didn't think he would survive. Nor did his colleague in an adjacent seat who was scrambling to write one last message to his wife and unborn son, he said.

A window is missing from the plane as it sits on the tarmac Tuesday at the Philadelphia airport.

"We could feel the air from the outside coming in, and then we had smoke kind of coming in the window. Meanwhile, you have passengers that were in that aisle, trying to attend to the woman that was bleeding from the window explosion," he said. "That was just chaos all around."

The plane descended precipitously, Johnson said, but the pilot regained control and informed passengers the flight was headed to Philadelphia.

"The crew did a great job," he said.

The flight tracking website FlightRadar24 estimated the Boeing 737-700 descended from 31,684 feet to about 10,000 feet in a little over five minutes.

Kelly told reporters Tuesday evening the plane was inspected April 15, but he had no details on what parts were examined.

"I'm not aware of any issues with the airplane or any issues with the engine involved," Kelly said at a news conference.

The engine had 40,000 cycles on it, a quarter of those since it was overhauled, he said.

Seven others hurt

It was a rough landing, Martinez said, and things were still so chaotic that he wasn't sure if the plane was going to crash. The jet could have been landing on a freeway for all he knew, he said.

"I didn't know if we were going to be running into a building. I didn't know what state the plane or even the pilot was in, if we were in condition to land," he said. "It was just all incredibly traumatic, and finally when we ... came to a halt, of course, the entire crowd was (in) tears and people crying and we were just thankful to be alive."

The Southwest jet suffered serious damage to the engine under its left wing.

Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said earlier that one of the 149 passengers and crew members on board was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Seven others were treated for minor injuries.

Feds begin investigation

Sumwalt said the airliner's flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were sent to Washington. The flight data recorder showed the plane was at 32,500 feet when the engine failed about 20 minutes into the flight.

Sumwalt said part of the inquiry will look at the CFM International 56 turbofan engine. Last year the FAA issued an airworthiness directive on the CFM56-7B version that would have required inspection of the fan blades.

"There are various iterations of that (engine) and so I can't say exactly what that airworthiness directive might have applied to at this point, but that will be part of our investigation," he said.

Later he said the cowling for the engine was found about 70 miles from where the plane landed.

In August 2016, a Southwest Airlines 737 flying from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, when an engine failed.

Southwest said this is the first death from an in-flight incident in company history.

Boeing said it is providing technical assistance in the investigation.

CORRECTION: This story has been revised to correctly describe the CFM International 56 engine on the Southwest jet.
__label__politics (CNN) Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona attended an hours-long dinner in London in July with an extremist Belgian politician who has a history of inflammatory and racist comments.

The Belgian official, Filip DeWinter, told CNN's KFile that Gosar joined him after the two spoke at an event in support of a jailed British activist at a dinner organized by former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.

DeWinter, who is known for his anti-Muslim views, is a prominent member of the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang -- a successor party to Vlaams Blok, which disbanded after being sanctioned as "racist" by Belgium's high court in 2004.

Gosar, a dentist by trade who has served in the House since 2011, is currently seeking his fifth term. CNN currently rates his race as solid Republican. A member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and an immigration hardliner, Gosar called on Capitol Police earlier this year to arrest undocumented immigrants at President Donald Trump's State of the Union address. In 2017, he claimed that the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was a left-wing plot

DeWinter told CNN's KFile that he and the congressman got acquainted at a pub before speaking at the rally and then went to a lengthy dinner together with Bannon, where they discussed the political organization Bannon was setting up in Brussels and the possibility of working together in the future.

"We were with five or six people at the same table, so we had the possibility for three or four hours to speak with each other about all sorts of topics concerning American politics, European politics, the plans of Steve (Bannon), the way things were going in Europe and the possibilities to work together also with the Freedom Caucus and with those people who are supporting us over in the States," DeWinter said.

Bannon didn't respond to a request for comment.

Gosar wrote in August that he "traveled to London to express my concern over Tommy Robinson's arrest and to fight back against suppression of the truth."

Gosar defended his appearance at the rally to CNN and said he could defend only his own words.

"I stand by my own words and votes in Congress," Gosar said in a statement. "I don't vouch for and need not vouch for anyone else's thoughts, comments or actions."

Speaking after DeWinter at the rally, Gosar called on British citizens to continue to assemble to support Robinson. He also called on members of Muslim communities to speak out against the so-called "grooming gangs" Robinson denounced in his videos.

"Do not be silent," Gosar said. "Never be silent. Whether you were born in the West or immigrated here for a better life, know and remember your duty to defend freedom and fight injustice. Yes, freedom comes alongside the ability to be lazy and disengaged but freedom also has attached to it the responsibility to be active and alert, vigilant and visible."

DeWinter expressed his extreme views at the rally, calling Islam "the enemy."

"By locking up an Islam-critical activist such as Tommy Robinson behind bars, we bend and fold for undemocratic Islam," DeWinter said. "And it's the British government, the British government with Theresa May, who is collaborating with the enemy. And the enemy, my friends, is Islam. The enemy is Islam. Because the Quran is a military manual to wage war against the West. The Quran is a license to kill."

DeWinter told CNN's KFile that he hadn't had further contact with Gosar or other members of the Freedom Caucus since the dinner. He added that while the two hadn't discuss his views about Islam during the meal, he did view the conservative congressional caucus as an ally in what he called a battle for "Western identity."

"I've never seen a program or a political program from the Freedom Caucus about their views of different issues, but I think that we can call ourselves allies, of course," he said. "We are fighting the same battle -- it is certainly the same -- for our Western identity, and although there can be some differences about several issues, we are fighting for the same goals, yes, and we are allies, yes."

__label__world (CNN) The Syrian regime has clawed back control of much of the country over the past few years: the city of Homs, the great prize of Aleppo, the countryside around Damascus and most recently the birthplace of the uprising, Daraa .

The regime, supported by its Russian and Iranian allies, is now preparing to retake the province, an area crammed with as many as 70,000 rebel fighters and nearly 3 million civilians, double its pre-war population.

Unless some deal is done to forestall such an assault, Idlib will be the "perfect storm," as the United Nations envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura put it on Thursday.

Half the civilians trapped in Idlib are displaced from other parts of Syria. It's the world's largest open prison, one whose infrastructure -- hospitals, schools, utilities -- has been targeted for years by regime and Russian attacks , according to multiple accounts by human rights groups.

If it occurs, the battle for Idlib would be the last and bloodiest act of a horrific conflict that has reduced much of Syria to ruins and killed an estimated 400,000 people in the process

Russia talking tough...

The Kremlin is talking tough, about both eliminating the "terrorists" in Idlib and "provocations" being planned by the West . Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described Idlib as "the last major hotbed of terrorists" -- who were holding civilians hostage and stifling groups that wanted to negotiate.

"So from all points of view, this hotbed must be eliminated," he said Wednesday -- also describing Idlib as a "festering abscess."

Russian officials have also claimed there's a plan by rebels, with western connivance, to stage a chemical weapons attack in Idlib and then blame it on the regime. The Syrian Foreign Minister went further, saying that civil defense volunteers known as the White Helmets had kidnapped 44 children to stage such an attack. (An opposition activist in Idlib told CNN Thursday that the rebels had neither storage facilities nor the expertise to use chemical weapons.)

Lavrov claimed that "the Americans are trying to ratchet up the tensions around Idlib" and that Russia had "clearly and firmly warned our Western partners: don't play with fire." Not coincidentally the Russian defense ministry has announced a large naval exercise off the Syrian coast to begin Saturday. Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, said Moscow was concerned by signs that the United States was preparing new strikes on Syria.

...but also talking Turkey

There's no doubt that Idlib is dominated by radical Islamist factions such as the former al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra (reinvented as Hayat Tahrir al Sham.) They are well organized and ideologically committed, defending territory they know well. De Mistura said Thursday there are about 10,000 fighters loyal to al Qaeda or al Nusra in Idlib (perhaps inadvertently providing the regime and Russia with the pretext to attack.)

An offensive to take most or all of Idlib would be costly, even more so than the immensely destructive battle for Aleppo. It would also damage or destroy Russia's carefully nurtured relationship with Turkey , which has troops in Idlib as part of an agreement to make the region a "deconfliction zone."

The Moscow/Ankara relationship is critical for the future of Idlib and indeed all of northern Syria. There have been almost daily contacts between the two governments this month. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said after an August 14 meeting with Lavrov that Turkey would not permit "a massacre" of civilians at the price of efforts to eradicate terrorist groups, according to the state-run news agency Anadolu.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey is working with Russia and Iran "to prevent an Aleppo-like disaster" in Idlib. As the Turkish military reinforces its dozen or so outposts in Idlib, Erdogan noted pointedly: "We are a nation that wins on the field not at the table."

To prevent disaster, Turkey is trying to persuade radical Islamist factions in Idlib such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to announce they are dissolving, so as to make the terrorist problem "disappear." So far there are no takers, although one activist noted that militant groups were being offered a stark choice: "merge or die."

JUST WATCHED Major rebel stronghold in Syria under threat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Major rebel stronghold in Syria under threat 03:54

Alexey Khlebnikov, a Middle East expert at the Russian International Affairs Council, told CNN it was "highly unlikely that there's going to be direct confrontation between the Syrian and Turkish military. If that happens it will push Ankara back into US hands, which goes contrary to Moscow's interests."

Relations between Moscow and Ankara have been painstakingly restored since a crisis in 2015 sparked by Turkey's shooting down of a Russian jet over its border with Syria.

'Beyond Conflict'

Somehow Russia has to keep both Iran and Turkey on board if it wants to get "beyond conflict" in Syria.

Critical to this is the return of refugees, of whom some 3 million still live in Turkey

An assault on Idlib would likely drive hundreds of thousands more civilians towards and over the Turkish border. UN officials envisage as many as 800,000 people trying to escape Idlib.

"Russia recently announced its main priority is return of the refugees -- not the opposite," says Khlebnikov. "Moscow is looking for a delicate solution which will take into account the interests and concerns of all parties."

So Russia may consider the establishment of humanitarian "corridors" as suggested by UN envoy de Mistura, in an effort to separate fighters from civilians. Whether many people from Idlib would want to enter regime-held territory is another matter. And ultimately where would these people go? 1.4 million of them have already been displaced once. "There is no other Idlib. Where can they go? Where can anyone go?" asks de Mistura.

War of attrition

For all these reasons, Moscow may prefer a more limited operation to eat away at the fringes of Idlib, starting in the south where the situation is not complicated by the presence of Turkish troops.

For sure, the Syrian regime has promised a bolder approach , with Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem insisting after meeting Lavrov that the army would "go all the way" in Idlib. But it would need intensive Russian air support to succeed.

An opposition activist in Idlib told CNN that the regime was massing troops to the south of Idlib (in northern Hama province), to reinforce its existing military positions rather than initiate an imminent offensive.

US declines to engage

Where is the West now, as the denouement of the Syrian conflict beckons? With few cards to play, somewhere close to resignation.

The US State Department says the Trump administration has expressed its concern about an Idlib offensive, though it shares the goal of eliminating groups like al Nusra

Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week: "We have shared the concerns that we have about any potential offensive taking place, we have shared those concerns with the Russian government at many levels," including conversations between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

There is no real US engagement with Russia on Syrian reconstruction while Assad is in power; nor is there much engagement with the remnants of the moderate Syrian opposition. The US has sent mixed messages about its military support of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the last enclave beyond regime control.
__label__world Story highlights Li Baiguang represented Chinese Christians and other religious minorities

He met with US President George W Bush and received an award from the National Endowment for Democracy

Hong Kong (CNN) A prominent Chinese lawyer, Li Baiguang died Monday in the Chinese city of Nanjing under "mysterious" circumstances, according to Bob Fu, a US-based activist and Christian pastor who has known the lawyer for over 10 years.

Li was admitted to the No. 81 Military Hospital with a minor stomach ache, but had been otherwise healthy, Fu said, citing a relative of Li's. He was declared dead hours later from liver complications, according to the activist.

Critics allege Li has fallen victim to the rights crackdown which has characterized the rule of President Xi Jinping , just as the Chinese leader seeks to extend his grip on power.

On Sunday, Chinese state media said the country's constitution would be amended to drop term limits on the Presidency, clearing the way for Xi to lead the country indefinitely.

The move has alarmed critics who say that Xi's tightening grip on power has come at an increasing cost to human rights and those who seek to defend them.
__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Israel has relaxed the country's restrictions on gun licenses, in a move that could make up to 500,000 more civilians eligible to carry firearms, provided they have a certain amount of military or security training.

The new regulations allow veterans of Israel's infantry units to more easily obtain licenses, as well as allowing officers and commanders who have completed their reserve duty to keep their weapons. The regulations also allow emergency responders and former police officers to obtain gun licenses more easily.

The change could potentially quadruple the number of civilians in Israel who have gun permits. Roughly 145,000 civilians currently have gun permits, according to Israel's ministry of public security.

The changes went into effect Tuesday, with Israeli minister of public security Gilad Erdan saying more armed civilians increases the chances of stopping attacks and preventing injuries.

"Trained citizens who hold weapons in the public sphere contribute to the feeling of security," Erdan said in a statement announcing the new regulations. "They are an important line of defense against 'lone wolf' actions and are used in a sense as a temporary force multiplier, thereby strengthening public safety."

__label__world (CNN) Washington's Catholic archbishop has asked priests to forgive his "errors in judgment" as he faces public pressure to resign amid growing outrage over clergy sex abuse.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, in a letter published Thursday by his archdiocese, also asked priests to let parishioners know during Mass this Sunday that he shares their pain over widespread allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests and cover-ups by bishops.

"I ask you ... for prayers for me, for forgiveness for my errors in judgment, for my inadequacies, and also for your acceptance of my contrition for any suffering I have caused, as well as the grace to find, with you, ways of healing, ways of offering fruitful guidance in this darkness," Wuerl wrote.

Abuse survivors and others have been calling on Wuerl to resign in the wake of an August 14 report by a grand jury in Pennsylvania , which said internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania showed that more than 300 "predator priests" were credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims since 1947.

Wuerl had been bishop of Pittsburgh, and the grand jury report alleges that he failed to deal adequately with pedophile priests during his tenure there. The Archdiocese of Washington has vigorously defended Wuerl , arguing in part that he took appropriate action against accused priests in light of what was known at the time.

In Thursday's letter, Wuerl asked priests to inform parishioners that he wishes he could wipe away their pain, "even though that is simply not possible."

"I would give anything, as would all of us, to turn the clock around and have the Church do everything right," Wuerl wrote. "But I do join them in sorrow for all that has happened.

"I plead for their prayerful support as I with you and them try to do whatever I can to help move this Church closer to the pathway that leads us from this darkness."

Wuerl is scheduled to celebrate Mass on Sunday at Washington's Annunciation Church. There, he wrote, he hopes "to offer some thoughts on how we as a Church -- all of us laity, religious and clergy -- might begin with faith strengthened in prayer to discern that level of reform rooted in accountability and transparency that would permit the Church to enter a new era."

At Mass last week he "prayed first for the survivors -- those who bear the scars of abuse," he wrote.

"On too many occasions over these past three decades as a bishop, I have sat with survivors and their families to listen, to try to be present, to pray and often simply to cry together," Wuerl wrote.

Wuerl also has been accused of covering up for his disgraced predecessor in Washington, Theodore McCarrick, who had been accused of sexually abusing seminarians in New Jersey before McCarrick came to DC. Archdiocesan officials have denied that Wuerl knew of the accusations.

Pope Francis forced McCarrick to resign from the College of Cardinals in July after those accusations, as well as church charges that he sexually abused a minor, came to light. McCarrick, 89, has not commented on the accusations that he abused seminarians and said he is innocent of the allegations that he abused a minor.

Survivor group asks for federal investigation

Only two priests have been charged as a result of the Pennsylvania grand jury's two-year investigation, because statutes of limitations in many cases expired, or the accused or accusers died.

But the Pennsylvania report has prompted officials in several other states, including Illinois and Missouri, to open inquiries into allegations of sexual misconduct by Catholic clergy

She has already hired law clerks for at least two more terms.

__label__world (CNN) Ivanka Trump, eldest daughter of US President Donald Trump, arrived in South Korea Friday as part of a charm offensive in the closing days of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Trump will attend the Closing Ceremony on Sunday night and will dine with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at his residence, the Blue House, on Friday.

Her trip to South Korea has drawn inevitable comparisons with that of the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , whose attention-grabbing visit at the start of the Games was regarded as a diplomatic success for the North.

Kim Yo Jong's three-day trip overshadowed that of Vice President Mike Pence, who ignored her at the Opening Ceremony and did not stand for a joint Korean team as it entered the stadium. Analysts suggest that the decision to send Ivanka Trump to the Closing Ceremony could be an attempt by the US to regain face.

Ivanka Trump, daughter of US President Donald Trump, arrives at Incheon International Airport on February 23.

As she arrived in Seoul, Trump told waiting reporters she was looking forward to cheering on US Olympians at the end of the Games. "It is a great honour to be here in South Korea with the US delegation," she said. "We are very, very excited to attend the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, to cheer for team USA and to reaffirm our strong and enduring commitment with the people of the Republic of Korea."

__label__world Diana Butler Bass ( @dianabutlerbass ) holds a Ph.D. in religious studies from Duke University and is the author of 10 books on American religion and culture, including "Grateful: The Transformative Power of Giving Thanks" (HarperOne 2018). The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) In a rare move on Monday , more than 600 leaders in the United Methodist Church filed a strongly worded formal complaint against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Methodist church member, charging him with violating the church's Book of Discipline in his immigration policy, which details "child abuse" (citing advocating for family separation and incarceration of children) and "racial discrimination."

It is highly unusual that such a complaint is brought against a member (typically charges like this have been filed against clergy), but Sessions' support of the family separation policy was deemed so far outside Methodist social teaching that these charges could force a process of church discipline that might include an ecclesiastical trial with potential result of expulsion from the church.

In many ways, the last thing the United Methodist Church needs right now is a conflict over Jeff Sessions. The church, which has around 7 million members in the United States, is strained already to the point of schism over issues related to the inclusion of LGBTQ people and their role in the church.

While there is no doubt that many Methodists will applaud religious sanction against Sessions, there are many others who will not. For a church maintaining a fragile unity , the issues raised by the complaint could add stress.

This story could be perceived as ecclesiastical inside baseball -- just another church argument at a time when religion is declining in cultural importance -- but something much larger is at stake: the impact of religious crises on national politics.

The Methodists are not alone in feeling the weight of fracture. Last week, the Southern Baptist Convention met amid tensions over race and a #metoo scandal. While they eschewed some right-wing stridency from their recent past, it is clear that they, like the Methodists, remain deeply divided -- and may be moving toward the point of schism between a white old guard establishment and a more diverse rising generation.

Put simply, America's two largest Protestant denominations -- one mainline, one evangelical -- are facing institutional rifts that pit established policies of the past against activist calls for inclusion, justice and new leadership. Their shared tensions are not uniquely religious. Instead, they are experiencing stresses endemic across American culture. And their common struggle makes this a pivotal moment in American Protestantism.

Despite conventional belief to the contrary, major schisms are somewhat rare in America's largest religious groups. American Protestantism is notorious for its tendency to splinter, with enough breakaway groups to fill up several history tomes. But those splits are often doctrinally specific and based on single issues, and the resulting denominations remain relatively small. When large-scale schisms happen, however, they fall along worrisome fault lines that exacerbate social conflict, heighten tensions, and worsen intractable political tensions in American culture. In the past, those major breaks have occurred around issues of individualism and authority, slavery and racism, tensions between science and faith, and the role of women in leadership.

1845 proved to be a crucial year for both groups. In the Methodist case, antislavery leaders voted to suspend a bishop who held slaves; in the Baptist case, antislavery members attempted to bar slaveholders from missionary work. In both churches, antislavery activists attempted to limit slavery by making it morally unacceptable and geographically constrained. By 1845, all neutrality and all compromises were off the table. Although antislavery forces won crucial votes and changed important church policies, aggrieved proslavery church members left -- forming the Methodist Episcopal Church South and the Southern Baptist Convention.

At the time, clergy, politicians and journalists noted that the schisms were a blow to the Union. Most historians believe these actions were the prelude to the Civil War and, in many ways, contributed to the nation's further political fracturing.

Is something similar happening now? Does this ecclesiastical tumult foreshadow an even larger political crisis awaiting us?

The answers are, yes and maybe.

As difficult as this moment seems, I think that historian Jon Meacham is correct when likening our time to a "Dred Scott" moment, referring to the Supreme Court decision that people held in slavery were denied the rights of full citizenship. Meacham, like many other historians, has insisted the primary divide was between those who recognized enslaved people as fully human and those who did not.

As the rights of citizenship were at stake in Dred, during the 1845 schisms the rights of church membership were the basic question. Did fully baptized people held in slavery have the same freedoms -- in theological language, "freedom in Christ" -- as slaveholders? The churches argued about the Bible's moral teaching regarding slaves and territorial expansion of slavery (as related to Western mission work), in effect struggling with whether black people in slavery were fully human. These Methodist and Baptist ecclesiastical arguments would re-emerge as secular issues at the fore in the Dred Scott case . The churches argued these concerns a full decade before the courts did. And the results were strikingly similar: divides and schism.

Today, the Methodists and Baptists are not really fighting over mere "issues." They are fighting about whether women , people of color, immigrants , and LGBTQ people should, on the basis of human dignity and worth, have full rights, responsibilities and respect in their church communities.

We are in the run-up, that time of uncertainty when a whole lot of people are making terrible decisions that eventually result in an even worse conflict. To have both Methodists and Baptists echoing their past fights now is stunning.

History, however, is not predestination. Just because something resembles a moment in the past, unless one is in a "Star Trek" episode, doesn't mean that repeating that past is possible. We have historical free will. We can make similar mistakes or we do better. The breakup of a church -- or two -- may portend only the breakup of institutions unwilling to change, not the dissolution of a great nation. Or, the tensions toward schism might only reveal a generational dynamism pushing for a vibrant and just future, not the end of the world.

__label__world Pyeongchang, South Korea (CNN) The White House has responded to North Korea's willingness to hold talks with the United States, saying in a statement Sunday that "there is a brighter path available for North Korea if it chooses denuclearization."

"We will see if Pyongyang's message today, that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization," the statement read. "In the meantime, the United States and the world must continue to make clear that North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are a dead end."

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a statement on Sunday that he'd met with the North Korean delegation in Pyeongchang before the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, and told them that North Korea-US talks should happen "as soon as possible."

Moon said the North Koreans indicated they were willing to talk with the US, and agreed that "the inter-Korean relationship and North Korea-US relationship should develop together."

Moon met for an hour with the North Korean delegation at an undisclosed location in Pyeongchang at 5 p.m. local time Sunday, three hours before South Korea prepared to host the carefully-choreographed closing ceremony.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A number of US Defense Department personnel are expected to travel to South Korea in coming days to assist with the expected return from North Korea on Friday of the remains of US service members killed during the Korean War. However, there is uncertainty over whether the transfer will actually happen as Pyongyang has still not given the US or South Korea final approval for the operation.

After Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent trip to Pyongyang, The Washington Post reported that the North Koreans said they were not ready to commit to any detailed plans to return the remains to the US.

Based on preliminary discussions, the US expects the North Koreans to turn over what they say are an initial 55 sets of remains, according to a US official. It may take months of detailed DNA analysis to determine how many American service members can be identified.

The US plan is for either an American or South Korean transport plane to fly into North Korea to pick up whatever remains the North Koreans are willing to transfer, according to the official. They would not disclose the exact location inside North Korea, saying the US is worried that too much publicity could endanger the North Korean agreement.

The US transfer plan calls for the US officials who fly into North Korea to conduct a "cursory review" of what the North Koreans turn over as it happens, the official said. Each case of remains will be opened and photographed for initial documentation of what it contains.

Indian media has been widely criticized for their "insensitive" coverage of her death

New Delhi (CNN) Indian news channels are being condemned for their "ghoulish" coverage of the death of Bollywood superstar Sridevi as the country continues to mourn her passing.

Local television channels have covered the 54-year-old actress' death relentlessly since she passed away unexpectedly Saturday night in Dubai while attending a family wedding.

Much of the criticism has focused on their use of elaborate onscreen graphics and recreations of the hotel room where she died as a means of speculating on the actress' final moments.

Despite the police ruling out any suggestion of foul play , the appetite for information regarding her death has intensified, leading some channels to begin promoting alternative conspiracy theories online with the hashtag #SrideviDeathMystery.

One local news station, not intent on using a mock-up, placed a reporter inside a bathtub during a live segment sparking outrage online.

__label__politics (CNN) Pope Francis earned a standing ovation when he told Congress in 2015 that he supports protecting human life "at every stage of its development." When he added that "this conviction" includes working to end the death penalty, the response was far more subdued.

"You didn't see people jumping up and clapping," said John Carr, who was in the room, and is director of Georgetown University's Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.

For decades, Catholic politicians who support capital punishment, including the senators and representatives in the chamber that day, had an "out" when it comes to church teaching: The Catholic Catechism, the church's book of moral and religious teachings, had allowed the use of capital punishment in certain cases. Any other opinions, even the Pope's, were just that, opinions, and not necessarily binding on Catholic consciences.

But that is no longer the case, the Vatican announced on Thursday.

At the Pope's direction, the Catholic Catechism has been revised, and now calls the death penalty "inadmissible." While years in coming, the shift raises new questions about how politicians, particularly conservative Catholics in red states, will navigate the church's revised stance.

"Pope Francis has said several times that he considers the death penalty inadmissible," said John Thavis, former Rome bureau chief for Catholic News Service. "Now, however, he has enshrined it in official Catholic teaching. That's going to make it much more difficult for politicians to dismiss this teaching as 'the Pope's opinion.'"

The church's shifting position on capital punishment may even arise later this year when the Senate holds confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, a federal judge and faithful Catholic whom President Donald Trump has nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court.

"It's hard to side-step this issue now that it's definitive church teaching," said John Gehring, a Catholic writer and Catholic Program Director at the liberal-leaning group Faith in Public Life.

"I think there is a proper and respectful way to ask Kavanaugh how his understanding of faith and morality intersects with his judicial views."

"I suspect that the matter will come up," agreed Richard Garnett, a professor at the University of Notre Dame's law school. "I'm not optimistic that any senator's question will reflect any serious engagement with, or understanding of, what Pope Francis actually did, but ... I expect it will come up."

If confirmed, Kavanaugh would be the fifth Catholic on the Supreme Court, which regularly opines on death penalty cases and hears requests for stays of execution. (It is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch , who was raised a Catholic but has worshiped in Episcopal Churches, identifies with either tradition.)

The death penalty was a controversial subject during the Senate's confirmation hearings last year for Amy Coney Barrett, who now serves on the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Noting an article Barrett wrote examining whether Catholic judges should recuse themselves from capital punishment cases, Sen. Dianne Feinstein famously said, "The dogma lives loudly within you."

Quiet conservatives

Among Americans, 54% favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% are opposed, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May. Among Catholics, the survey found that 53% of Catholics favor capital punishment, while 42% oppose it.

Death penalty opponents celebrated the Vatican's announcement, calling it the culmination of years of planning and work, while hoping it could change more attitudes among lay Catholics.

"For people in the pews, it is a challenge to actively build a culture of life by abolishing the death penalty, especially in the 31 states that still have it on the books in this country," said Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy, who leads Catholic Mobilizing Network, an anti-death penalty group.

Many conservative Catholics, meanwhile, were mostly quiet on Thursday. Several prominent legal and political figures did not respond immediately for comment. But in the past, several Catholic governors had said that the Catechism gave them leeway to enforce the death penalty.

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, whose state overwhelmingly supports capital punishment according to polls, told journalists in 2014 that there's no conflict between his Catholic faith and state law on the issue.

"Catholic doctrine is not against the death penalty, and so there is no conflict there," he said.

Likewise, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is Catholic and lobbied against a state ban on the death penalty, has said capital punishment can be justified.

"The Catholic Church does not preclude the use of the death penalty under certain circumstances: That guilt is determined and the crime is heinous. Also, protecting society," Ricketts said in 2015

Abbott and Ricketts' offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On Thursday, Sister Helen Prejean, a prominent opponent of capital punishment, called on Ricketts to fall in line with the Pope and cancel planned executions.

Will Catholic @GovRicketts, who spends a lot of time talking about his "pro-life values," heed the words of Pope Francis by cancelling the experimental execution scheduled for August 14 in Nebraska? #DontKillForNE — Sister Helen Prejean (@helenprejean) August 2, 2018

Nebraska's three Catholic bishop echoed Prejean's call to cancel the execution and urged Catholics and others to lobby state officials.

"Simply put, the death penalty is no longer needed or morally justified in Nebraska," the bishops said

What the Catechism says now

"Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good," the Catechism will now say.

But an "increasing awareness" that criminals don't lose their human dignity, a "new understanding" of prison systems and the development of "effective systems of detention" have led the church, under Pope Francis, to revise its official views, the Vatican said.

"The death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person," the Catechism will now say.

Does all of this mean that Catholic politicians will immediately switch positions on the death penalty?

Don't bet on it, said Helen Alvaré, professor of law at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.

"The death penalty teaching may be observed or ignored, as is the abortion teaching, even though both are about killing," Alvaré wrote in an email.

"Politicians of any religion seem to variously ignore, observe both as a matter of consistency, or take inconsistent positions!"

__label__politics (CNN) As President Donald Trump faced allegations of racism and cruelty on Tuesday, his press secretary stepped to the White House podium to deny only one of those charges.

Briefing reporters for the first time in weeks, Sarah Sanders insisted Trump was not using racially coded language when he disparaged a disgruntled former aide, who is African-American, as a "dog."

But her defense -- that Trump has insulted people of all races, not just African-Americans -- only underscored how the President and his aides have embraced his caustic attitude.

"The President's an equal opportunity person that calls things like he sees it," Sanders said. "He fights fire with fire."

The explanation came amid a string of defenses against charges made in Omarosa Manigault Newman's new memoir, "Unhinged," which portrays the President as racist and lewd.

__label__world (CNN) Around 1 p.m. last Saturday, the weather was clear when Prajak Sutham, 14, Pipat Bhodi, 15, and some of their soccer teammates chained their bikes to a rail, hooked their backpacks over their shoulders, and hiked into Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the mountains of northern Thailand.

The 12 boys, members of the Wild Boars soccer team, and their 25-year-old coach, had explored inside the cave before.

Popular with tourists, it's a place locals know well. For the first kilometer (0.6 miles) or so inside the cavernous entrance, limestone rock formations hug high ceilings, creating an almost amphitheater-like atmosphere.

Deeper inside, the passages narrow into places the locals warn it's not safe to go.

For reasons unknown, the boys and their coach ventured on, deeper into the cave network, past signs that warn people not to enter during the rainy season, which usually begins in July.

They forged ahead as the ceilings dropped and the pathways contracted. They'd clocked three kilometers (1.8 miles) by the time they reached a fork in the passageway. To the left, a longer trek, but an exit point at the end.

To the right, higher ground, where a chimney-like chute made of rock jutting straight up out of the mountain was the only way out.

They took off their backpacks and their shoes. Outside, it began to rain.

A pair of soccer shoes left at the entrance of the Tham Luang Nang Non caves.

It was hours later that a ranger from the national park in Chiang Rai Province alerted authorities, when he noticed the bikes still chained up after the park had closed. Search and rescue efforts began soon after.

The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their coach, have now been missing for a week. Emergency services working frantically to find them have spent the past few days dropping food down holes they find in the jungle-covered mountain in the hope it connects with the caves below.

Volunteers help pump water out of the cave entrance. Search and rescue teams from the US military have arrived at the Thai government's request to help with the effort, along with British underwater cave experts.

Thai Navy Seals with diving gear have swum some five kilometers (3 miles) into the pitch-black passageways to try to find the boys and returned without a sense of where they might be. There's not been a sound from the missing boys all this time.

Their families are frantic.

"When I saw his bike parked inside the cave (entrance) my tears just dropped," said Pipat's father Pinyo Bhodi. "I was desperate to find my son."

In the vigils that have grown with every day of fruitless searches, families and friends have prayed, made offerings, and held fast to the possibility of signs of life. Some, enduring the torture of such a long, silent wait, have collapsed in the mud with exhaustion, and been sent to hospital.

"I feel I have just lost my heart when I found his bag, mobile phone and his shoes," said Prajak Sutham's father Sudsakorn. "But all I can do is wait."

The boys are close to each other and their coach, said Noppadon Kanthawong, one parent whose son plays on the team, but who'd decided to skip Saturday's cave trip.

"He would be there at the field waiting for the kids to show up after school," he told CNN. "It's a great way to keep healthy, away from screens, and have friends. I can tell that they are very close to each other," Noppadon said.

Noppadon and his son huddled with other teammates at the entrance to the cave, waiting for any word on the rest of the Wild Boars team.

Thai soldiers walk out of the entrance to the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, Friday, June 29.

Meanwhile, the rain continued to beat down, preventing helicopters from searching for possible hidden entry points, and drones from sweeping the 10 kilometers (6 miles) stretch looking for heat signatures. Small channels within the cave system have also limited the use of underwater vehicles.

Even as workers pumped water and mud out of the cave, the rain persisted, complicating efforts. Vernon Unsworth, a British caver and longtime resident in Chiang Rai, who has explored the cave before, told CNN water was the greatest danger.

"Physically, it's not a hard cave, it's just very long and it has big passages, small passages," he said. "It's not difficult but if the children have gone in too far then the floodwaters from the far end will be coming through. With the rain, it's not making it any easier."

He added that oxgyen levels in the cave would be dangerous if the flow of air was incapacitated by rising water levels.

Buddhist followers pray at the entrance of Tham Luang Nang Non caves in the hope of finding the boys alive.

On Friday, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha visited the rescue site, where some 840 soldiers, 90 members of a special forces unit, four helicopters, excavators and disaster relief equipment have been dedicated to the rescue effort.

Thailand's energy ministry said it would supply drills for an operation focused on creating cavities in the side of the mountain to try to locate the team. The environment ministry said it would donate x-ray machines for scanning purposes.

On Friday morning, workers said a narrow opening in the hills above the cave might be a potential access point.

British cave experts entered the natural chimney Friday morning and managed to descend to a depth of about 20 meters (65 feet). Rescuers believe dropping in from above is a more promising option to reach the tunnels because it is not blocked by floodwaters.

Thai officials plan over a map of the Tham Luang Nang Non caves.

Water pumps, brought from the capital of Bangkok and designed to alleviate major flooding in the city, have been working relentlessly to ease water levels inside the passageways.

Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn told CNN the heavy duty water pumps have made a difference, but the rain continues to be a significant factor.

"We are in the rainy season, but the amount of rain we are facing is very unusual. It rained (on June 27) from 8 p.m. until 1 a.m. Our teams who were working inside the cave had to withdraw to the mouth of the cave," he said. "We just can't fight with the water."

He told a news conference Saturday that Thai agencies had lessons to learn from the rescue effort, which is a first of its kind for the country. Meanwhile, military personnel performed evacuation drills -- carrying people on gurneys out of the cave to ambulances -- so as to be ready in the event search teams find the boys and their coach.

It's not the first time people have disappeared inside the cave for an extended period of time -- and survived.

Thai soldiers relay electric cable deep into the entrance of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave network.

According to unconfirmed local news reports , a former village headman in the area of Tham Luang said that in 1974, a group of foreign hikers had become trapped in the same cave for seven days. However conditions then were dry.

Narongsak was still hopeful that even after seven days, with so many elements against them, the boys and their coach will survive.

"We have hope they are alive," he said. "If you asked me if they are alive, I would say we have hope."

Pipat Bhodi had a birthday last Sunday. His father Pinyo told CNN that the family had planned a surprise party for Pipat. A cake for the birthday boy remains untouched.

"We need a miracle," Pipat's father Pinyo said. "I want him back."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Wednesday that bureaucracy and inefficiency across local and federal government entities are to blame for the deaths of nearly 3,000 on the island in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which came to light as part of a newly released study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government.

In particular, Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz blamed President Donald Trump, federal officials and Puerto Rican officials for not providing more assistance in what the Puerto Rican government now acknowledges was a storm deadlier than Hurricane Katrina.

"You know, everybody is responsible because there were people in power that had the opportunity to request more aid, to request more aid when it was reasonable, to request more aid when it was needed, to tell the truth and they didn't," Yulín Cruz told CNN "New Day" host Alisyn Camerota. "It's 2,975 people and they're still calling it an estimate -- 2,975 people that will never see the light of day and many of them died because of what was done by the administration and that was silently approved by most of the political class in Puerto Rico."

"The administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect. The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us," Yulín Cruz said, later adding, "Shame on President Trump. Shame on President Trump for not even once, not even yesterday, just saying, 'Look, I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico.'"

In a statement Tuesday following the Puerto Rican government's decision to raise the death toll, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump "remains proud of all of the work the Federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico."

Pentagon spokesman Col. Rob Manning confirmed that the service member killed in the crash was an American.

All personnel on the aircraft were recovered and three were evacuated for treatment.

"The aircraft was conducting a partnered counterterrorism mission in support of Operation Inherent Resolve," said a statement Monday by the coalition, which is fighting ISIS in the region.

According to the coalition, the incident is being investigated but there aren't indications the crash was caused by hostile fire.
__label__politics (CNN) Presidential candidate Donald Trump is heard on tape discussing with his attorney Michael Cohen how they would buy the rights to a Playboy model's story about an alleged affair Trump had with her years earlier, according to the audio recording of the conversation aired exclusively on CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time."

The recording offers the public a glimpse at the confidential discussions between Trump and Cohen, and it confirms the man who now occupies the Oval Office had contemporaneous knowledge of a proposal to buy the rights to the story of Karen McDougal, a woman who has alleged she had an extramarital affair with Trump about a decade ago.

Cohen told Trump about his plans to set up a company and finance the purchase of the rights from American Media, which publishes the National Enquirer. The recording captures what appears to be a routine business conversation of several matters on their agenda. The audio is muddled and the meaning of Trump's use of the word "cash" is disputed by the two sides.

"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David," Cohen said in the recording, likely a reference to American Media head David Pecker.

When financing comes up again later in the conversation, Trump interrupts Cohen asking, "What financing?" according to the recording. When Cohen tells Trump, "We'll have to pay," Trump is heard saying "pay with cash" but the audio is muddled and it's unclear whether he suggests paying with cash or not paying. Cohen says, "no, no" but it is not clear what is said next.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Roberta McCain, John McCain's 106-year-old mother, is expected to attend the services for her son at the Capitol, the National Cathedral and the Naval Academy, according to McCain aides.

She is expected to attend the formal ceremony at the US Capitol honoring her son's life and service to the nation on Friday morning. The late senator will lie in state at the US Capitol.

Roberta McCain is also expected to attend McCain's memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington Saturday, where former Presidents Barack Obama and George W.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The father of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has been indicted for allegedly making illegal contributions to his daughter's 2014 US Senate campaign.

A federal grand jury indicted Gerald Lundergan, 71, of Lexington, Kentucky, on charges of using corporate funds for her campaign and then conspiring to cover them up. According to the Justice Department, Lundergan was charged by the grand jury with several counts, including one count of conspiracy and one count of making corporate campaign contributions.

Political consultant Dale Emmons, 66, of Richmond, Kentucky, was also indicted by the grand jury. He has been charged with conspiracy, making corporate campaign contributions and "causing the falsification of documents with the intent to obstruct and impede," a Justice Department release announcing the indictment said.

While the indictment never names the candidate Lundergan contributed to, Alison Lundergan Grimes, his daughter, ran unsuccessfully in 2014 as a Democratic challenger to Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who serves as Senate majority leader.

In a statement posted to Facebook on Friday, Lundergan Grimes said she believes her father will be "vindicated."

__label__world London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out a second referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union, saying it would be a "gross betrayal" of democracy.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph , May said she would not "give in to those who want to re-open the whole question with a second referendum," adding that "to ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy -- and a betrayal of that trust."

Her comments came after "the People's Vote" campaign group, which is calling for a second Brexit referendum, recently secured a $1.3 million (£1 million) donation from British fashion mogul Julian Dunkerton.

UK voters in June 2016 voted yes in a referendum to leave the EU , more than four decades after joining. Brexit is due to take place on March 29, 2019, followed by a 21-month transition period when the divorce comes into effect.

__label__politics Above the South China Sea (CNN) High above one of the most hotly contested regions in the world, CNN was given a rare look Friday at the Chinese government's rapidly expanding militarization of the South China Sea.

Aboard a US Navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance plane, CNN got a view from 16,500 feet of low-lying coral reefs turned into garrisons with five-story buildings, large radar installations, power plants and runways sturdy enough to carry large military aircraft.

During the flight the crew received six separate warnings from the Chinese military, telling them they were inside Chinese territory and urging them to leave.

"Leave immediately and keep out to avoid any misunderstanding," a voice said.

The US Navy jet flew past four key artificial islands in the Spratly chain where China has built up fortifications: Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Johnson Reef and Mischief Reef.

On Subi Reef, the Poseidon's sensors picked up 86 vessels, including Chinese coast guard ships, moored in a giant lagoon, while on Fiery Cross Reef rows of hangers stood alongside a lengthy runway.

"It was surprising to see airports in the middle of the ocean," said Lt. Lauren Callen, who was leading the air combat crew aboard the Navy flight.

Each time the aircraft was challenged by Chinese military, the US Navy crew's response was the same.

"I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state," the response said.

"In exercising these rights guaranteed by international law, I am operating with due regard for the rights and duties of all states."

CNN has reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.

CNN gets rare access on board a US military surveillance flight over the hotly-disputed islands in the South China Sea.

Competing claims

The Chinese government staunchly maintains large areas of the South China Sea have been part of the country's territory "since ancient times."

Beijing's "nine-dash line" extends more than one thousand kilometers from its southernmost province, taking in more or less the entirety of the waters, through which the United Nations estimates one-third of global shipping passes.

The South China Sea is also believed to contain rich oil and natural gas reserves that have yet to be fully explored.

Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei all claim overlapping portions of the sea which spans 3.6 million square kilometer (1.4 million square miles), but the most far-reaching claims have been made by China.

Beijing's sovereignty claims are considered by most other countries as unsubstantiated, a view backed by an international tribunal in 2016.

Despite this however, little has changed in China's approach to the region in recent years.

To reinforce its claims of sovereignty, Beijing has been reclaiming land on and around reefs and shoals to construct artificial islands which are then militarized with airfields and radar equipment.

China has spent much of the past two years fortifying these islands, including placing missiles on the Spratly island chain during naval exercises in April.

This is despite a promise made by President Xi Jinping to then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that the Chinese government would not be militarizing the artificial islands.

The US Navy's P8-A Poseidon plane which carried a CNN crew from Okinawa, Japan, over the South China Sea on August 10.

Rapid expansion

The last time CNN was given access to a US Navy mission over the South China Sea was in September 2015, when the aircraft was also warned off by Chinese military.

Since then, Beijing's island building in the contested waters has moved forward at a rapid pace.

Flying over Fiery Cross Reef on Friday, a five-story building was visible, as well as a large radar installation, which looked like neatly arranged golf balls on the Navy plane's infrared camera.

Though no Chinese missiles were seen on Friday's flight over the South China Sea, Navy officers said some of the structures seen could potentially be used to house them.

Cmdr. Chris Purcell, who leads Patrol Squadron Four which undertook Friday's mission, said the US has been doing these flights for five decades and they show US commitment to maintaining free passage in international waters.

"The reason we're here hasn't changed," Purcell said. "The reason (the Chinese) are here has changed."

Within hours of the trip, Chinese state tabloid Global Times posted a reaction to CNN's report on its Chinese-language website. The article called for all readers to "give a thumbs-up to Chinese servicemen" for their defense of China's territory.

China claims US sparking militarization

Beijing says its growing military presence in the South China Sea is necessary to protect its sovereignty, blaming Washington and its allies for tensions in the region.

Chinese military exercises in April included the largest naval parade in the country's history, with President Xi Jinping overseeing drills that included 10,000 troops, 48 naval vessels and 76 fighter jets.

Beijing points to the regular US Navy patrols and flyovers of the South China Sea as an example of US militarization and provocations, and a justification for the increased Chinese military presence.

"By playing up the so-called China's militarization in the South China Sea, certain people in the US are staging a farce of a thief crying "stop thief"," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in May . "It is self-evident to a keener eye that who is militarizing the South China Sea."

In the past year, the US has stepped up freedom of navigation operations in the region, sailing US naval vessels within miles of China's artificial islands across the South China Sea.

The exercises , which the US also conducts in other parts of the world, assert the navy's right to travel wherever it pleases in international waters, a vital component of Washington's naval power across the world.

Time may be running out to effectively challenge China's claims in the South China Sea however.

Adm. Philip Davidson, the recently installed head of the US Pacific Command, told Senators during a confirmation hearing in April that China is already very firmly entrenched.

"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States," Davidson said.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein got into a sparring match over reports that a staffer who once worked for the senator in California allegedly had a connection to Chinese spying.

At a rally in Ohio on Saturday night, the President claimed that Feinstein "had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years." Trump also incorrectly said that Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is "the leader of the Russian investigation."

Several committees that are chaired by Republicans have been involved in conducting hearings and interviews related to Russian interference in the 2016 election, including the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees and the House Intelligence and Government Oversight committees. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is leading the special counsel investigation into Moscow's election meddling and possible collusion by Trump associates.

Trump went after Feinstein during the rally after making his first reference to the Russia investigation. The President added, "I like Dianne Feinstein I have to tell you, but I don't like the fact that she had a Chinese spy driving her and she didn't know it."

Feinstein hit back at Trump, responding to a Twitter post of his earlier on Saturday that asked whether she would investigate herself.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that White House Counsel Don McGahn's resignation shows the White House is "in full attack mode on the special counsel."

"It certainly completes a full circle," Schiff told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's "The Situation Room," "where the administration initially took a strategy they would cooperate with special counsel and now they've pushed out basically everyone that had that view."

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday on Twitter that McGahn would be leaving his position in the fall.

"You saw Rudy Giuliani acknowledge just the other day that his whole goal is not to tell the truth, it's not to be consistent, it's merely to undermine Bob Mueller," Schiff said.

Giuliani told The New York Times , "You probably can't do this without making a mistake or two," but "Mueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game."

__label__politics (CNN) John McCain knew what it was like to be down. Way, way down.

From the more than five years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison camp to his implication in the "Keating 5" scandal to his losses in not one but two presidential elections, he was someone well-acquainted with hardship. And he never hid that hardship. In fact, he spoke about it regularly -- talking about how he had learned over time to deal with the setbacks in his life.

With the country mourning McCain's passing , I went through a handful of his biggest speeches -- his 2008 concession to Barack Obama, his address upon returning to the Senate following his brain cancer diagnosis and even the letter he penned to be read posthumously by one-time campaign manager Rick Davis on Monday -- to pluck out McCain's most powerful thoughts about loss, longing and the mistakes he made -- and what can be learned from them.

1. "I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here." ( 2008 concession speech

2. "I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary. So I chose to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth." (On not calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Capitol building, April 2000

3. "We've all played some role in it. Certainly I have. Sometimes, I've let my passion rule my reason. Sometimes, I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes, I wanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy." ( Senate floor speech, July 2017

4. "Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else's." (Posthumous letter, August 2018

5. "I think I'm going to miss him more than I can say. We disagreed on most issues, but I admitted -- but I admired his passion for his convictions, his patience with the hard and sometimes dull work of legislating, and his uncanny sense for when differences could be bridged and his cause advanced by degrees." (Speech at Ted Kennedy's memorial service, August 2009

6. "I have served America's cause -- the cause of our security and the security of our friends, the cause of freedom and equal justice -- all my adult life. I haven't always served it well. I haven't even always appreciated what I was serving. But among the few compensations of old age is the acuity of hindsight. I see now that I was part of something important that drew me along in its wake even when I was diverted by other interests. I was, knowingly or not, along for the ride as America made the future better than the past." (Liberty medal speech, October 2017

7. "I don't think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. There's greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people."

8. "In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans, who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president, is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving."

10. "I have, sometimes unwittingly and often imperfectly, served that cause all my adult life. Like your service, mine began here in this place of honor and honor's demands. I arrived a rebel without a cause, and left much the same. But I would discover that a sense of honor had been imparted to me here that would speak to me in the darkest hours." (Speech at US Naval Academy, October 2017)

Anyone can be magnanimous and gracious in victory. Few can do so in the face of defeat or disappointment.

John McCain was one of the latter.
__label__politics (CNN) When Navy ensign Sam Bongiorno opened his mailbox on Monday, he found an envelope he never expected to see: a letter from the late Sen. John McCain.

McCain had written to congratulate him on his recent graduation from the Merchant Marine Academy. The letter, written on August 20, was mailed on August 25 from McCain's Phoenix office.

"I graduated in June, but never expected to hear from him or his office due to his declining health," he told CNN. McCain himself graduated from a service academy: the Naval Academy.

"I commend you for your decision to serve our nation," McCain wrote in the letter. "It is young people like you who make the future of this nation brighter and stronger."

__label__politics The two fighter pilots, captured by the North Vietnamese military in the late 1960s, were in solitary confinement in Hoa Lo Prison where American servicemen were imprisoned and tortured during the Vietnam War.

Crecca said his and McCain's cells were next to one another. They communicated by tapping on the wall.

"There's a wall between us, but there's an emotional bond between us that can't be broken. It's like steel," Crecca, now 77, told CNN affiliate KCPQ-TV . He was captured 11 months before McCain.

McCain, who died Saturday at age 81 , spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war at Hoa Lo, known to most Americans as the "Hanoi Hilton."

His Skyhawk jet was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967. He parachuted into a lake near Hanoi, breaking both arms and a leg, and was captured by communist soldiers. In captivity, McCain was tortured and beaten, an experience that left him with lifelong injuries, including severely restricted movement of his arms.

Like other American POWs, McCain and Crecca used a complex communication system known as tap code -- tapping out messages on the wall of their cells -- to communicate with each other.

"We would pass humorous things through the wall," Crecca told KCPQ. "You knew you succeeded when you could hear the guy on the other side laughing."

Crecca said McCain kept his spirits up, even through torture and the risk of "those communists re-breaking his arms."

During his time as a POW, McCain refused a preferential release offer, made because his father was an admiral. He turned down the offer until his comrades could also go home.

"He clearly was a man of extreme courage and of loyalty to the United States of America," Crecca said. "To his family, to his God, and to his country."

Decades later when McCain ran for president in 2008, Crecca and his wife, Joan, were there to support him during a fundraising trip in Seattle, Washington.

"He remembered the time when we were tapping through the wall to each other. And of all things, what he says to Joan is 'Joe was a great resister,'" Crecca said, surprised by his fellow veteran's remarks. "He endured much more than I did."

McCain rarely talked about what he went through in Vietnam, according to an October 2017 YouTube video commemorating the 50th anniversary of his capture

McCain returned to visit Hoa Lo in April 2000. A photo from the visit is on display at the prison, which has been transformed into a museum.

"I put the Vietnam War behind me a long time ago," McCain said at the time. "But I harbor no anger nor rancor. I'm a better man for my experience, and I'm grateful for having the opportunity of serving."
__label__politics (CNN) Sen. John McCain announced Friday in a statement that he cannot "in good conscience" vote for the GOP's latest plan to overhaul Obamacare, likely ending Republicans' latest effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

"I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal," the Arizona Republican said in a statement. "I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will (affect) insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won't be available by the end of the month, we won't have reliable answers to any of those questions."

McCain's "no" vote means it is likely Republicans won't be able to repeal and replace Obamacare before September 30, as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he would not back Graham-Cassidy and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has said she is leaning "no" on the proposal. But there are still questions as to where Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is at the moment. It's also unclear if senators on the fence would support a procedural motion on the bill even if they decide they are against Graham-Cassidy in the end.

Republicans need at least 50 votes to pass the measure under the process of reconciliation.

Murkowski, Paul and Collins also under scrutiny

McCain was one of three most-watched members on the fence and considered a key vote on the bill. Without his support, Republicans would need to get Murkowski as well as Collins to sign on. It's unlikely considering the fact that Collins said Friday afternoon that she was leaning against the bill and had key concerns that the legislation did not do enough to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions.

"I'm leaning against the bill," Collins said Friday at a Portland, Maine, event, according to The Portland Press Herald.

A Republican aide involved in the process said Friday afternoon that GOP leaders are at the "evaluating options" stage right now.

The aide added, "I'm not breaking news telling you this isn't good."

Paul, the only other Republican other than McCain who has so far definitively come out against Graham-Cassidy, is "unlikely" to change his mind even if changes are made to the bill, his spokesman Sergio Gor told CNN.

Graham and McCain's close friendship

McCain's announcement comes despite that one of the bill's key sponsors -- Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- is a close confidant. The thinking was if anyone could convince McCain to vote "yes," it would be Graham.

"I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it," McCain said. "The bill's authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I."

McCain has said for weeks that he would not support health care legislation that had not gone through "regular order," meaning Senate hearings, an amendment process and a rigorous floor debate.

Graham said he "respectfully" disagrees with McCain and will "press on" with his legislation.

"My friendship with John McCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he's lived his life and the person he is," Graham said in a statement and on Twitter, adding later, "I feel an obligation to fix this disaster and intend to push forward for state-centric health care versus Washington-knows-best health care."

My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he's lived his life and the person he is. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017

McCain voted "no" on the last health care proposal in July for the same reason. McCain's dramatic floor vote, which happened just weeks after he was diagnosed with brain cancer, came in the early morning and was captured as one of his most "maverick" moments in the Senate.

What the White House is thinking

A senior White House official told CNN that McCain's opposition "undeniably hurts" the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare but that President Donald Trump is not ready to give up on the effort yet.

"The President has been engaged all along, and I think you will continue to see him reach out," the official said. "We have been having conversations with Graham and Cassidy for a couple months and ... even though there may be members who want to give up, the President does not."

Top White House aides have been talking with Graham and Sen. Bill Cassidy for months now, and in between events at the United Nations this week, Trump called senators to talk about the upcoming health care vote, White House officials said. Trump was hoping to solidify Republicans around the deal struck by the two senators and urged many of the lawmakers to stay loyal to him.

The White House official, though, added that even though chances of passing health care look bleak, the White House intends to juggle between Graham-Cassidy and tax reform next week.

Vice President Mike Pence indirectly addressed the decision during a speech Friday afternoon in Anderson, Indiana.

"The vote could come as early as next week and this is not going to be easy. Even now, the opposition is forming up and some have gone so far to announce their opposition already. But President Trump and I are undeterred," Pence said.

"We cannot in good conscious abandon this cause," Pence said to applause in his home state.

Democrats praise McCain

Just moments after McCain announced his opposition, Democrats seized on the opportunity to bring back bipartisan talks that had stalled last week.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee had held bipartisan hearings over the last month on how to stabilize Obamacare marketplaces and were making progress in their negotiations. But the House leadership made it clear last week that the chamber probably would not be able to pass such a bill.

As soon as McCain announced his opposition, Murray announced she was still open to reigniting those talks.

"I agree with Senator McCain that the right way to get things done in the Senate — especially on an issue as important to families as their health care — is through regular order and working together to find common ground," Murray said. "I'm still at the table ready to keep working, and I remain confident that we can reach a bipartisan agreement as soon as this latest partisan approach by Republican leaders is finally set aside."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also praised McCain shortly after his announcement.

"John McCain shows the same courage in Congress that he showed when he was a naval aviator," the New York Democrat said in a statement. "I have assured Senator McCain that as soon as repeal is off the table, we Democrats are intent on resuming the bipartisan process."

For her part, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said her members would continue working "to put the stake in the heart of this monstrous bill."

"This weekend, we will continue to highlight the devastating costs Republicans are trying to inflict on hard-working Americans," she said in a letter to colleagues.

__label__politics London (CNN) The United States ambassador to the UK has called on Britain to side with President Donald Trump on Iran or risk "serious trade consequences" for UK businesses.

In a pointed intervention into an issue that has strained ties between the two allies, Woody Johnson said the UK should embrace Trump's hard-hitting sanctions on Iran , reimposed last week, and break with its European partners who are seeking to preserve the deal to curtail Iran's nuclear program.

"America is turning up the pressure and we want the UK by our side. It is time to move on from the flawed 2015 deal," Johnson wrote in the UK's Sunday Telegraph , referring to the 2015 Obama-era pact agreed by the US, Iran, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump withdrew from the deal in May.

"We are asking global Britain to use its considerable diplomatic power and influence and join us as we lead a concerted global effort towards a genuinely comprehensive agreement," Johnson added.

In a joint statement last week, Britain, France and Germany said the Iran deal was "working and delivering on its goal" and said they "deeply regret" the reimposition of US sanctions.

Europe has attempted to counteract the effects of the sanctions by launching an updated version of its "Blocking Statue," a measure intended to protect EU companies doing business in Iran from being hit by punitive US measures.

On Sunday, Johnson seemingly disregarded the move, urging British businesses directly to cut ties with Iran.

"The President has been explicit: any businesses which put their own commercial interests in Iran ahead of the global good will risk serious consequences for their trade with the United States," Johnson wrote in the Telegraph.

"Only by presenting a united front can we exert the maximum possible pressure on the Iranian regime and get them to finally change course and put an end to their malign and reckless activities both at home and abroad."

Johnson's comments come less than a week after the Trump administration on Tuesday reimposed a raft of sanctions on Iran that affect, among other things, the purchase or acquisition of US dollars by the Iranian government, the country's auto industry and trade in gold or precious metals.

Another phase of US sanctions will be reimposed in November and will target Iran's crucial oil industry.

The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2018

Shortly after the sanctions snapped back into place last week, Trump warned in a tweet that countries doing business with Iran would "NOT be doing business with the United States."

Trump has long been a fierce critic of the nuclear deal, agreed under his predecessor, calling it "insane" and maintaining that, even with the current restrictions in place, Iran continues to pose a threat to the US.

Even with European safeguarding measures, the threat of US sanctions appeared to further rattle businesses with interests in Iran. On the same day sanctions were reimposed, German carmaker Daimler announced it had suspended its activities in Iran "until further notice according to applicable sanctions."

Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of German industrial conglomerate Siemens, summed up the harsh realities of US economic influence over European business when he told CNN in May that the company would stop all new deals in Iran, following Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal.

"There is a primacy of the (US) political system. If that primacy is 'This is what you are going to do,' then that is exactly what we are going to do. We are a global company. We have interest and values and we have to balance both," said Kaeser.
__label__politics (CNN) Ayanna Pressley became the latest primary challenger to upset a sitting Democratic member of Congress on Tuesday, defeating Massachusetts Rep. Mike Capuano in the Boston-area district once represented by John F. Kennedy.

The 44-year-old Pressley -- who eight years ago became the first black woman ever elected to Boston's city council, and campaigned for a more activist style of leadership -- has long been seen as a rising star in Democratic politics.

She joins a growing group of younger, progressive Democrats -- often women and people of color -- to win competitive primaries, a week after Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, 39, became the first black person to win a major party's nomination for governor in Florida

Pressley was seen as the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -style giant-slayer who could take down an incumbent House Democrat. But there are major differences between the two candidates and their races: Ocasio-Cortez came out of nowhere to defeat New York Rep. Joe Crowley . Pressley, though, was already a well-known figure in Massachusetts politics, and the race was seen as close and competitive for months.

The Massachusetts 7th District race was also not a moderate-vs.-progressive match-up.

Capuano, a 20-year incumbent, was one of the most progressive members of Congress. That made for unusual dynamics: The Congressional Black Caucus PAC had endorsed Capuano. But Pressley is now poised to become the first person of color Massachusetts has ever sent to Congress.

Pressley said the two would vote the same -- but that their styles would be different.

One of her go-to lines, said at a recent campaign event in Cambridge, was that "we might vote the same way but we will lead differently. These times require, and this district deserves bold, activist leadership."

She raised less money than Capuano and spent it on get-out-the-vote efforts, Spanish-language ads and other efforts to target young and minority voters.

One of their most significant differences was over the tactics of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Pressley backed Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the National Anthem, while Capuano said the tactic "divided America."

Pressley has long been a Democratic star in the making who's been closely watched since her 2015 speech at an EMILY's List event headlined by Hillary Clinton -- but, with no members of Congress retiring, had no path to the national stage.

Pressley is a commanding stage presence who frequently ditches microphones; she doesn't need them.

Her campaign slogan -- "Change Can't Wait" -- connected the Democratic optimism of the early Barack Obama years to the urgency of Donald Trump's presidency.

In an effort to reach voters she says have been ignored, she talks openly about her father being incarcerated for much of her childhood and how she is a rape survivor.

Her go-to line, that "the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power," explains her calls for change in a district where people of color now outnumber white people.

In a recent interview at Tacos El Paso, a Mexican restaurant in Everett, she said she'd long idolized Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan, pioneering Democrats who were among the first black women in Congress.

That she'd diversify Massachusetts' all-white, mostly male House delegation is "the bonus" of her candidacy she said during that interview.

"It's about who I listen to and it's about who I govern with. And there are a lot of people in this district who feel left out and left behind and ignored -- and it's not just women, it's not just people of color," Pressley said. "It runs the gamut. And I think after a generation, the district deserves a choice."

The 7th District is heavily Democratic, and Pressley is now expected to coast to victory in November.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The White House is working behind the scenes to limit the testimony to congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to multiple sources.

The attempts to curtail testimony to congressional investigators became clear this week when former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and infuriated both sides of the aisle by refusing to answer questions about his work during the presidential transition and in the White House.

At some points during Bannon's six hours of closed-door testimony, his attorney took breaks to confer via telephone with the White House counsel's office to clarify what questions could be answered and came back with the same guidance: Bannon could not discuss any activities related to the transition or his tenure in the White House.

"All shots were called by the White House," says one source familiar with the proceedings.

Publicly, White House officials and President Donald Trump's personal lawyers have touted the administration's willingness to cooperate with the ongoing probes.

"We've been fully cooperative with the ongoing investigations, and we're going to continue to do so," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in Wednesday's press briefing. "We encourage the committees to work with us to find the appropriate accommodation in order to ensure Congress obtains all the information that they're looking for."

But when it comes to the congressional investigations, the White House counsel's office is instructing some witnesses to limit their testimony, testing the extent of executive privilege by refusing to discuss any activity that occurred after the 2016 election.

The White House claims that while Congress is entitled to ask any question it wants, privilege can be waived only by the President. They argue that, in this case, the transition is covered by privilege, while the campaign is not.

Democrats see it as an effort to muzzle important witnesses. "This was effectively a gag order by the White House preventing this witness from answering almost any question concerning his time in the transition or the administration. And then any questions even after he left the administration," said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee.

Bannon's team negotiated ground rules with the White House counsel's office the week prior to his appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The President's personal legal team was aware of discussions between the White House counsel's office and Bannon's lawyer about protecting a possible privilege claim. But it wasn't their decision, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The protection of the privilege is a matter for the White House, not the President's legal team, because it relates to the office.

Before the hearing, Bannon's lawyer informed a staff member of Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, that Bannon planned to claim executive privilege on topics beyond the presidential campaign, a source said.

But that information was apparently tightly held. "It caught me personally by surprise" that Bannon asserted executive privilege, said Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the committee's Russia investigation.

South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy and Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, the other two Republicans leading the Russia probe along with Conaway, also said they weren't aware of any agreement between the White House and committee staff about the scope of Bannon's testimony.

Gowdy added that, if there were an agreement, he didn't think the staff would have told him anyway because he wouldn't have abided by it.

"They wouldn't do that because I'd ask what I think is relevant to ask, and if you've got a legal privilege you can assert it," Gowdy said, adding that Bannon was in a "legally indefensible position."

As it became clear on Tuesday that Bannon was refusing to answer questions, the committee served him with a subpoena to compel him to divulge additional information.

The President's personal lawyers were not consulted on the specific questions that prompted calls to the White House, a source said.

On Wednesday, the White House insisted such coordination between the White House counsel's office and congressional witnesses isn't unusual in a case like this.

"That's the same process that is typically followed," Sanders said. "Sometimes, they actually have a White House attorney present in the room. This time, it was something that was relayed via phone and, again, was following standard procedure for an instance like this, and something that will likely happen again on any other number of occasions, not just within this administration, but future administrations."

But the scope of what Bannon was claiming was privileged shocked members from both parties.

"His version of executive privilege is it covers the transition, the time he was at the White House and covers time forever," Gowdy told Fox News Wednesday. "That is no one's definition of executive privilege."

"I certainly have never heard of an example where executive privilege is claimed for a president-elect, I have never heard of privilege being claimed for conversations between two people that don't include the president, which were precluded from being asked about today," Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and a member of the committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday.

Lawmakers were also offended that Bannon had already divulged details about some of his post-campaign activities in Michael Wolff's explosive book "Fire and Fury," but then refused to discuss those events with the committee. Bannon's attorney also informed members that he would, in fact, answer those questions when he meets with special counsel Robert Mueller's team because executive privilege doesn't apply to Mueller's investigation.

Sanders declined to say Wednesday whether the White House has actually invoked executive privilege yet or is simply protecting its right to do so in the future.

"I can tell you that this White House is following the same practice that many White Houses before us have, that have gone back decades, that there is a process that you go through: Anytime you have congressional inquiries touching upon the White House, the Congress should consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material," Sanders said. "This is part of a judicial-recognized process."

When Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared before the House Intelligence Committee, in order to preserve the right for Trump to invoke privilege, he refused to answer questions about whether Trump instructed him to hinder the Russia investigation.

National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats both refused in a public Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to discuss private conversations with Trump and whether he tried to interfere with the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

In December, Donald Trump Jr. refused to tell House investigators what he discussed with his father after reports surfaced about the June 2016 meeting Trump Jr. held with Russians in Trump Tower. In this instance, Trump's son cited attorney-client privilege because attorneys were present during the conversation with his father, pushing the issue even further into far murkier legal territory.

Democrats charge that Bannon's appearance before the House committee marks the broadest attempt so far at using privilege to shield events that occurred from the moment Trump was elected.

So far lawmakers have taken only limited steps to challenge witnesses about whether their claims of privilege are legitimate.

Republicans haven't ruled out the possibility of holding Bannon in contempt, but at least one GOP member -- Gowdy -- suggested it was unlikely.

House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the issue of whether witnesses like Bannon might be abusing the bounds of executive privilege.

"There has always been a tension on executive privilege between the legislative branch and the executive branch. This goes back to every administration," Ryan said. "Obama exercised executive privilege, Bush did, Clinton did. That is a typical tension that you are going to have between the two branches of government."

Still, Bannon's stonewalling sparked a sharp warning from Conaway -- the Republican leading the House Russia probe -- to White House aides who might follow the Bannon model: "We're going to insist on getting questions we need to answer our report."

Bannon could appear before the House committee again on Thursday and "we fully anticipate" he will answer questions, Conaway said.

For its part, the White House offered a dismissive response to the ongoing Russia probes.

"I think we've been dealing with this hoax for the better part of a year," Sanders said Wednesday. "If we have to endure the ridiculousness for another month, we can certainly handle it."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) ISIS very much remains a threat and is "well positioned" to rebuild, despite being driven to only a few small towns on the banks of the Euphrates River in Syria, the Pentagon said Wednesday.

The Pentagon was responding to a recently published i nspector general report , which said the US military estimates that ISIS still commands up to 30,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.

"ISIS remains a threat, and even one ISIS fighter is one too many," Pentagon spokesman Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson told CNN.

"I will let the report stand on its own," he said, adding that "manpower is not a good metric to assess the volatility of this terror group."

"What really matters is the capability and intent of ISIS members worldwide, and that's why the fight is not done," Robertson said.

'Out of Syria'

The inspector general's assessment was followed by a separate UN report by a division charged with monitoring terrorist groups that also put the number of remaining ISIS fighters in the tens of thousands. At its height, in 2014-2015, the group had declared that it had established a caliphate, or Islamic state, which stretched across large swaths of Syria and Iraq, an area the size of Ohio.

President Donald Trump has trumpeted his administration's success in ejecting ISIS from most of Syria and Iraq, asserting earlier this year that the US would "be coming out of Syria like very soon ."

But the new estimates suggest that the US military may have to stay in the region for some time to counter the ISIS threat.

"We know that the caliphate has been practically destroyed," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday, when asked about the new estimates. "Certainly there continue to be ISIS fighters, and that's why we continue to take all of those threats seriously and look for ways every single day to defeat them and protect American people and our allies."

Asked about ISIS' strength, the deputy commander of the military coalition fighting ISIS said Tuesday that while he thought the UN numbers seemed "a little bit high," he could not speak to their veracity without understanding the methodology.

'The threat remains'

"We know there are over a thousand, which is our initial problem, in the Middle Euphrates River Valley," UK Maj. Gen. Felix Gedney told reporters, referring to the last ISIS redoubts in Syria.

"The threat remains throughout Iraq and Syria. And we need to make sure that we do enough to ensure the security and stability post-liberation," Gedney said.

The US military assesses that ISIS has lost about 98% of the territory it controlled at its peak. Gen. Tony Thomas, commander of US Special Operations Command, estimated last year that some 60,000 to 70,000 ISIS fighters have been killed during the course of the campaign of about four years.

The US-led air campaign has also destroyed most of the terror group's revenue streams and killed numerous leaders involved in planning terror attacks around the world.

The Pentagon believes that despite those battlefield losses, ISIS is still more capable than its predecessor organization, al Qaeda in Iraq. That group carried out a wave of deadly attacks throughout Iraq and was the primary target of the tens of thousands of US troops who were deployed to Iraq more than a decade ago.

"We have assessed that, even after the liberation of ISIS controlled territory, ISIS probably is still more capable than al Qaeda in Iraq at its peak in 2006-2007," Robertson said.

Robertson said the Pentagon believes ISIS "is well positioned to rebuild and work on enabling its physical caliphate to re-emerge."

Officials say the threat still posed by ISIS is greater due to improvements in communications technology, which allow ISIS plotters to connect more easily with sympathizers around the world. They also point to the terror group's use of foreign fighters and those fighters' links to their countries of origin.

There are also concerns about ISIS' affiliates, including the terror group's Afghanistan branch.

The UN report said that ISIS core "continues to facilitate the relocation of some of its key operatives to Afghanistan," including foreign fighters from Europe.

The report said that recent terror plots were detected and prevented in Europe had originated from ISIS in Afghanistan.

__label__politics (CNN) Setting up a showdown with California, the Trump administration on Thursday announced a plan to revoke a signature Obama-era environmental regulation.

The administration wants to freeze a rule mandating that automakers work to make cars substantially more fuel efficient. It called its plan a "50-state fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standard for passenger cars and light trucks."

The administration also proposed a withdrawal of California's Clean Air Act preemption waiver. California and about a dozen states that follow its rules account for about a third of all the passenger vehicles sold in the United States.

California Governor Jerry Brown called the proposal "reckless."

"For Trump to now destroy a law first enacted at the request of Ronald Reagan five decades ago is a betrayal and an assault on the health of Americans everywhere," said Brown, in a statement. "California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible."

(CNN) Republicans were relieved when Debbie Lesko won a special election on April 24 to maintain GOP control of the Phoenix area congressional seat of former Rep. Trent Franks. Lesko's 52.4%-47.6% victory over Democrat Hiral Tipirneni — based on unofficial but near complete returns — was welcomed by Capitol Hill Republicans who were panicked after Democrat Conor Lamb won a House special election in March in Pennsylvania in a congressional district which, like Arizona's 8th Congressional District outside Phoenix, President Donald Trump carried handily in 2016. Both Franks and the Rep. Tim Murphy from the Pennsylvania district had resigned in scandal.

But an analysis of the special election returns from the 143 precincts that make up the congressional district in Arizona shows that Tipirneni performed better in many of the Republican-leaning precincts in the district, relative to results from the 2016 presidential election, than in its Democratic enclaves. This suggests that Tipirneni's message that Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare to fill the yawning federal budget deficits exacerbated by the 2017 GOP tax cuts hit home with independent and even some GOP voters.

While many Democratic operatives have argued that the party's fortunes in the midterm elections in November will be determined by its ability to drive partisan Democrats to the polls -- making the midterms a so-called "base election"-- Tipirneni's performance suggests that a "persuasion" strategy with a message aimed at swing voters and disenchanted Republicans could also play dividends. Indeed, in GOP House seats that Hillary Clinton didn't win or even come to close carrying in 2016, a persuasion approach is probably critical.

We grouped precincts in Arizona's 8th Congressional District by the percentage of the major-party vote won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and compared that to how Tipirneni performed in those clusters of precincts in the 2018 House special election.

Where Clinton got less than 30% of the vote in 2016, Tipernini gained 11.1 percentage points. Where Clinton got more than 50% of the vote in 2016, Tipernini ganed less than 5 percentage points.

__label__world Midway Atoll, North Pacific Ocean (CNN) -- The distance from humanity yawns out in front of you when you stand on the pale sands of this tiny Pacific island. Midway Atoll is just about the furthest piece of land from civilization and its constant engine whir, data and jostle. Standing on the island's remote shoreline brings a calm and humility -- until you look down at your feet.

On the beach lies a motorcycle helmet, a mannequin's head, an umbrella handle, and a flip-flop. They didn't fall from a plane or off a ship, and there aren't any civilians living here who could have left them behind. They were washed in with the tide, most likely from China or the US, thousands of miles away -- part of an enormous plastic garbage patch, spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which you probably contribute to. And these are just the bits of it we can see. Plastic has become a vital part of our lives of convenience. Yet the coffee cup lids, water bottles and bags we use once and throw away do end up somewhere -- in landfills, but also in the ocean. Nearly every piece of plastic ever made still exists today. More than five trillion pieces of plastic are already in the oceans, and by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish, by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Some 8 million tons of plastic trash leak into the ocean annually, and it's getting worse every year. Americans are said to use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour. Nothing is an emergency until you feel the burn, or see the red lights. Here plastic's impact is staring you in the face. Midway is out of sight, but again it is on the front line. Once home to the decisive battle that turned World War Two in favor of the US in the Pacific, it's now locked in a new fight.

The smell of decay You have to fly to Midway at night. Only then do the millions of birds that swarm the island in high season vacate the runway. We could only get here with permission from the US government and the help of a private jet. The smell hits you first, and catches in your throat. It's the whiff of decay, of thousands of birds' bodies rotting. Part of this is nature: CNN visited the island in June -- the time of year when the Laysan albatross lay their chicks, who must learn to fly, or die. But part of it is man-made: When you tear open the fragile ribcages of the birds who did not survive -- as US Fish and Wildlife Service Superintendent Matthew Brown did in front of us -- the sheer volume of plastic waste now in our world becomes apparent. Inside the slight skeleton of one albatross, we found bottle tops and a cigarette lighter amongst seemingly endless tiny shards of plastic. It's as if plastic actually was the bird's diet. These brightly colored plastic fragments were picked out of the sea by the bird's parents, who mistook them for food, then fed them to their offspring. The birds can't digest the plastic pieces but they still feel full, which causes malnutrition and death, according to researchers. Volunteers here have an almost full-time job scooping up the corpses. kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading They have tried to clean Midway up; the huge dump of plastic trash sitting on the runway awaiting collection by boats is evidence of that. But it's almost impossible because so much washes ashore daily -- not to mention the five tons the birds fly onto the island inside in their stomachs each year, according to Brown. The Eastern Island is now littered with tiny fragments of plastic. The birds die and decay, but the plastic inside them stays forever in the sand -- a layer of man's doing that will never go away. Midway will probably vanish under rising ocean levels before the plastic decays. Albatrosses walk along a plastic-littered beach in Midway. Jackson Loo/CNN The plastic-filled stomach of a dead albatross. Jackson Loo/CNN "These are the classic 'canary in the coal mine' scenarios," said Brown. "This is an animal that relies entirely on the ocean for its survival, just like 3 billion people do. If their children, their chicks, are being impacted by plastic this much, it is simply a forbearer of what is coming for us." From fish to plate So much of the damage is on the edge of the invisible. If you kneel down on Midway and stick your hand into the hot sand, you can pull up a troubling multicolored array of particles. These are what activists call the "new sand" -- plastic that has broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, and then become part of the shoreline. Are you eating your own toothbrush? Your toothbrush is one of many everyday items made of plastic. Most plastics are made from oil. Plastic production has surged in the past 50 years and could double again by 2036. 15 million tons in 1964 311 million tons in 2014 612 million tons in 2036 Billions of toothbrushs are thrown away every year. But less than 14% of plastics are recycled globally. At least 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans each year - that's one garbage truck a minute. More than 5 trillion pieces of plastic are in our oceans, weighing 269,000 tons - the same as 3,585 blue whales. By 2050, there may be more plastic in our oceans than fish. Most plastic doesn't biodegrade - it breaks down into smaller pieces, which attracts toxins... You could be ingesting up to 11,000 pieces of microplastic each year - and the toxins that come with them. Sources: Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Lisbeth Van Cauwenberghe These smaller particles are what end up in the food chain. The smallest ones, called nano-plastics, sink deep into the ocean and can end up in plankton. Larger pieces, known as micro-plastics, float in a soup, suspended in water, and are eaten by fish. The fish then get eaten by "apex predators" higher up the food chain -- including humans, or the Hawaiian Monk Seal. We don't know as much as we want to about what plastic has done to these seals -- they're endangered, so there are restrictions on opening them up for study by scientists. But there are already troubling signs. Jessica Bohlander, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says the seals are acting as a "sentinel for exposure to plastics and other persistent organic pollutants for humans." "A few individual animals we have seen have very high levels [of micro-plastics], particularly in adult males," she said. Bohlander says plastic ingestion could be causing reproductive problems for the seals -- and the bigger the animal, the bigger the concentration of plastic. "It is very troubling," she said. "With every step of the food chain, the concentration that can be measured in the tissues of animals becomes magnified."

11,000 pieces of plastic each year Seafood is essential to human life, but there is growing evidence that fish may prefer eating plastic to food. Swedish scientists recently demonstrated that larval Perch raised in waters containing micro-plastics "only ate plastic and ignored their natural food source of free-swimming zooplankton." This diet of plastic stunted growth rates, reduced hatching rates, and caused abnormal behaviors in the young fish, according to the study. There's also evidence that plastic is harmful to humans. The US government says styrene -- one of the key ingredients in plastic -- is probably a human carcinogen. It is studying the effects of plastic litter on marine life and plans to launch an inquiry into the effects on human health, including fetal formation. One study found that man-made marine debris may cause "physical harm" to humans when ingested via seafood. Another estimated that Europeans who eat shellfish could be exposed to 11,000 pieces of micro-plastic each year. What science hasn't proven yet is whether the plastic in the fish we eat directly damages our health. But it's getting there, and the case for real government concern is growing. And Midway, just by dint of its own distance and damage, is making that case. Matthew Brown told me he eats sushi much less than he used to. "Plastics also attract other contaminants, so if you are eating food that has little bits of blue and red in there, these are attracting ... other contaminants in the ocean. This has a real impact on our primary food source."

The choice the world has made We took a boat out from the island, towards the coral reef that surrounds it. There, you can feel the awesome power of nature. Caught in the reef nearby was a sight far more troubling than the bottles we had seen float past us on the water. In one inlet was a soup of tiny white pellets. A huge piece of Styrofoam packaging had been caught, now bobbing and slowly breaking down. In its thick soup was a bottle-top, a feather, and other gunk. You could swim into it easily, let your head emerge up in its midst. Signs of resilience and defiance in nature abounded, but in one corner, man's carelessness had occupied a visible space and, perhaps for longer, an invisible one. We simply do not know what we have already done. The hardest part about the journey to Midway is the sense of powerlessness it leaves you with. The damage there began with choices -- and litter -- made decades ago. And the problem is growing, not shrinking, as humanity gets more environmentally aware. Stopping this flow of trash would require an incredible change in the daily behavior of 7 billion people. China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are considered the five worst offenders when it comes to plastic pollution, according to a study published in Science, and you can anticipate as much success telling people there to stop using disposable plastics as you would do in the US. Road test the phrase: "I'm sorry, you can't have that coffee as you haven't brought your own reusable cup." kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading So what can you do? Very little, unless we all do it. You can start by bringing water bottles to work, or a reusable fork to the café, or insisting on less packaging for products. For now, the balance of convenience versus the likely risk to human health is in the favor of the coffee cup. If the science isn't there yet, public opinion won't be either.

There is a tiny glimmer of hope amidst this looming disaster, one I often heard while talking to researchers, one that shows people can change. It's a recent example of something so glaringly, obviously bad for the planet -- and people -- that for centuries was accepted as a normal part of our happy, modern world. Remember smoking? We don't do that as much anymore.

__label__world Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.

The capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.

The organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity

Organ trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.

That same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.

In Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.

Jeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.

Out of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.

"I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems," Jeet Bahadur said.

But many Nepalis do.

JUST WATCHED Watch the full documentary: Nepal's Organ Trail Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch the full documentary: Nepal's Organ Trail 21:21

During our visit, Nepal Kidney Center in Kathmandu was packed with patients having dialysis -- a grueling four-hour process of purifying blood through a machine.

A patient can avoid the kidney transplant by having dialysis at least three times a week.

Those lucky enough to afford a transplant still face obstacles: the donor must match the blood group of the recipients and Nepali law requires the organ donor to be a family member.

Nepal's 'kidney bank'

We traveled to Kavre, a tiny district close to Kathmandu, and what activists and authorities say is a ground zero for the black market organ trade in Nepal.

Here, kidney trafficking rackets -- well organized and well funded -- dupe the poor and uneducated into giving away a piece of themselves.

The district has developed an unfortunate reputation as the "kidney bank of Nepal."

For more than 20 years, activists say, people from villages in Kavre have been the primary source of kidneys for sick and desperate patients throughout Nepal. But now the numbers are being tracked.

In the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.

"Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward," said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.

'The meat will grow back'

Nawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.

Like many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms. Poor and uneducated, all he has is two cows, a house and a tiny plot of land.

JUST WATCHED Victims tell their story. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Victims tell their story. 01:01

Pariyar used to visit Kathmandu to find construction work. He was on a site in 2000 when the foreman approached him with a dubious offer: if he let doctors cut out a "hunk of meat" from his body, he would be given 30 lakhs -- about $30,000.

What he wasn't told: the piece of "meat" was actually his kidney.

"The foreman told me that the meat will grow back," Pariyar said.

"Then I thought, 'If the meat will regrow again, and I get about $30,000, why not?'"

"What if I die?" Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.

The foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.

Then he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.

Traffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.

"At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did," Pariyar said.

"I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)

"Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff."

Pariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.

He never received any more money and never found the trafficker.

"After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt. So, I went to the doctor. That's when I found out I am missing a kidney," Pariyar said.

Pariyar is now sick and getting worse by the day. He has a urinary problem and constant severe back pain.

But he cannot afford a trip to the doctor and is afraid he will die.

"If I die I can only hope for the government to take care of my two children. I don't know if I will die today or tomorrow. I'm just counting my days," Pariyar said.

Pariyar's experience is one of many similar stories we heard in Kavre.

Understanding the economic situation in this district is the key to understanding why so many people here easily fall prey to kidney traffickers.

There are hardly any other economic opportunities other than substantial farming and rearing livestock. One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.

"The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible," Ghimire said.

Indian links

Traffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.

Few hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants. And even the doctors in Nepal know most well-heeled patients prefer to go across the border to India.

Two brothers who were duped by kidney traffickers show their scars

"They want better services, they want Indian doctors. That's why they go to the hospitals in India," said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.

But activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.

"It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India," Ghimire said.

We noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.

Photographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.

Since Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.

Activists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.

With the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.

While the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.

Last year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.

Sub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.

"If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another," Chand said.

Rajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.

"We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well," Ghimire said.

The attention to this problem is growing in Kavre. Kidney trafficking stories are making headlines on the local and national newspapers.

But for victims like Pariyar and others, the media attention is too late.
__label__politics Story highlights The lush side of lobbying is on display at luxury resorts

Congressmen and senators host weekend retreats to taste wine, fish, play golf

Lobbyists accept the exclusive invitations -- and then make political donations

They say there's no better access to politicians and their staffs

On any given weekend, lobbyists in Washington head for the airport to jet off to luxurious locations across the country.

Destinations include Napa Valley in California for wine tasting, Wyoming for fly fishing and any number of spas, golf courses, even exclusive hunting trips.

They are invited to these weekend retreats by members of Congress and their political action committees.

The cost of accepting the invite is a political donation of anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000. And that doesn't include the cost of travel and lodging at some of the most posh resorts in the United States.

Why go? Lobbyists tell CNN there is no better access to a member of Congress and his or her top staff than spending a relaxing weekend with them, away from Capitol Hill.

Rep. Duncan Hunter hosted a cocktail party as the sun set over the Pacific.

It used to be that lobbyists would take politicians on trips, but when rules were changed and that was outlawed, politicians and their fund-raisers came up with this variation -- organize the trips and invite the lobbyists along to pay for them.

This past August, CNN followed U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, to a lush weekend retreat at the Montage Laguna Beach resort . The weekend was capped off by a seaside cocktail party hosted by the congressman as the sun set over the Pacific.

In early September, U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, hosted a golf weekend at the Inn at Perry Cabin , a posh resort on the banks of Chesapeake Bay. A Friday night terrace cocktail party included a special appearance by fellow Maryland lawmaker U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, who was one of the first on the links the next morning.

Both Cardin and Hunter declined interview requests.

Hunter's aide told us: "The congressman holds events of all types in many different venues and either people choose to support him or they don't, simple as that."

Cardin's communications director, Sue Walitsky, sent an email explaining that the fund-raiser at the Inn at Perry Cabin was for the senator's leadership PAC, "so none of the funds raised went to support his personal campaign."

Sen. Ben Cardin welcomed paying guests to the Inn at Perry Cabin, overlooking Chesapeake Bay.

She went on to say the weekend also provided the senator "an opportunity to show off one of the many beautiful locations in his home state."

__label__world But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.

Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.

His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.

"I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay," ten Hoopen said.

With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.

Photographer Pieter ten Hoopen

The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.

One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.

"This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people," ten Hoopen said.

The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.

The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.

Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.

"They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible," he said. "I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."

The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.

"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way," ten Hoopen said.

He said some patients at the hospital "had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."

I build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen

Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.

Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.

Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.

"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment," he said. "It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."

How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?

"It wasn't hard," he said. "I just told them to relax and have fun.

"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature."
__label__world Story highlights Jacob Russell's intimate photo essay follows Kurdish female fighters

He says the images of these Peshmerga have an important social, political role

Cale Salih is a visiting policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. You can follow her on Twitter. The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) The image of the braided Kurdish female fighter, donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group ISIS, may have done more to promote the Kurdish cause in the West than anything else in recent years.

The Iraqi Kurds have long been pro-Western in orientation, but Western powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support, in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence. Now, with soccer moms in Middle America tweeting photos of Kurdish female fighters, Western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid Kurdish policies to their constituencies.

Jacob Russell's sensitive photo essay brings much-needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of Kurdish female fighters.

Photographer Jacob Russell

Since last summer, international media -- and Kurdish politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women. Images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour ("girls with guns," as Russell calls this type of portrayal) tend to portray more of the photographer's assumptions about the woman's emancipation than her actual experiences as a Kurdish woman in combat.

Russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters.

__label__world Story highlights Photographer Trupal Pandya took portraits of the Huaorani people in Ecuador's rainforest

The community is beginning to modernize, but it still maintains its traditional ways of living

(CNN) Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani.

Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits.

The Huaorani, which means "the people" or "human beings," are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.

Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.

Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.

__label__world The CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life.

(CNN) When Kieu was 12, her mother asked her to take a job. But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a "certificate of virginity." She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.

In 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was "Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary," which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.

In Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.

Kieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of "maybe more than 50" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : "The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.

"Beforehand, Kieu said, 'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt 'very heartbroken.' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, 'They held me like I was in prison.'"

She was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.

Her story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and "Everyday in Cambodia" was named "outstanding documentary" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.

Sorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.

"Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking," she says. "It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited."

AIM also now works with an "incorruptible" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.

But Sorvino adds that it's not just about helping the victims. "The demand side really needs to be addressed," she says. "If people weren't trying to buy child sex it wouldn't be being sold."
__label__world (CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.

But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.

What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.

But the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.

Guatamala's past still haunts

Cifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.

Many women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.

A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.

There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.

Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.

Explosion in violence

Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.

Prevailing culture of machismo

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.

According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, "80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed." This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.

U.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls

The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.

"Politicians don't think women are important," says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. "Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor."

Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.

Quiroa says "They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade."

Signs of progress

Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.

Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.

Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or "The Powerful," have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.

Five Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or "The Powerful" share their stories and help other women get support.

The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.

The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or "Opening Opportunities". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.

Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. "They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights."

Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.

The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.

Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.

Adelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.

Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, "We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women."

But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.

Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.
__label__world Story highlights Photographer Andres Figueroa spent a week in one of the driest places on Earth

He took portraits of Chileans who dress up in costume for popular religious festivals

(CNN) South America's Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, resembles some of the faraway planets monitored by giant telescopes there.

The lack of humidity provides optimal conditions to watch the sky and study the origins of the universe.

"It is pure visual silence," said photographer Andres Figueroa . "It is amazing. There is absolutely no humidity, and (these conditions) create some striking contrasts."

There, in that clear, inhospitably arid environment, Figueroa turned his camera lens toward another discussion on cosmology, one rooted in the ancient folklore of the Andean people.

Taking along his mobile lighting studio, Figueroa photographed a series of religious festivals that take place every July in the Atacama. In his "Dancers of the Deserts" series, Figueroa chronicles these festivals, which attract about 200,000 people to some otherwise quiet mining towns in Chile.

__label__world Story highlights Four years of war means four years without schools and education in Syria

Hiba was nearly done with university when she was forced to flee her home near Damascus

To help Hiba and the many other displaced Syrian students, go to CARE

(CNN) I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago.

I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher.

I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment.

Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety.

When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The biggest story of the 2016 election is undoubtedly the rise of Donald Trump, and behind the Republican nominee is a group in its last throes as the biggest force in politics: The white working class.

Contrary to many assumptions about this group, the poll finds working class whites generally happy with their lives, and mostly satisfied with their personal financial situation. Just 18% say they are angry about the way things are going in their own lives, and 44% think America's best days lie ahead. They are just as likely as their black and Hispanic working class counterparts to feel optimistic about their lives, 7 in 10 or more say so in each group.

But the white working class harbors deep concerns about the country's economy, the amount the government is doing to help the working class and their own ability to influence politics.

A majority, 53%, say they are very dissatisfied with the country's economic situation and 84% say their views are not well represented by the government in Washington, well above the share of white college graduates or black or Hispanic working class to say the same.

About 6 in 10 white working class people say it's gotten harder for people like them to get ahead financially and two-thirds say it's harder to find good jobs. Many are concerned about what the next generation will face: 50% say they expect their children to have a lower standard of living than they currently have, compared with 35% among whites who have college degrees, 43% among the black working class and 31% among the Hispanic working class.

More than other groups, whites without college degrees blame the government for the economic problems that beset the working class, with 62% saying the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for those problems compared with less than half among whites with degrees and the black and Hispanic working class, and 66% saying it doesn't do enough to help the working class.

Amid these concerns, Trump holds broad appeal among white working class voters. Sixty percent say they would consider Trump this fall, about double the 29% who say they'd consider Hillary Clinton. Among other groups, far fewer even say they would consider Trump. Among whites with college degrees, 39% say they'd consider him -- that's cut in half among Hispanic working class voters, 18% of whom say they'd consider Trump, and just 3% of black working class voters say they'll give Trump a look.

White working class voters are more Republican than Democratic, 56% in the CNN/KFF poll are Republicans or independents who lean that way, compared with 33% who consider themselves Democrats or are independents who lean that way, but the poll reveals that their views on what the government does to help people like them and the changing demographics of the country -- two issues that have been a central focus of Trump's campaign -- are driven by both education and partisanship.

The undeniable trend

For nearly all of American history, whites without college degrees -- the group identified as white working class for the purposes of this survey and in many assessments of the American electorate -- made up a majority of the public and a majority of voters.

That has changed, and rapidly, at the same time the nation's economy has shifted to favor those who hold college degrees. Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 by an electorate in which 63% of voters were whites who had not completed a four-year college education, according to exit polls. That had dropped 10 points by 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency. That election marked the last time exit polls would find whites without college degrees to be a majority of voters. By the time Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, just 39% of those who cast ballots were whites without degrees.

Census figures for voting and registration suggest that the white working class make up a larger share of the electorate than do the exit polls, roughly 44% in 2012 in that estimate. Both data sources have different and unquantifiable sources of error, and there has been some dispute over their true share of the electorate. Regardless of the data source, however, the trend is the same and undeniable -- the white working class is shrinking, and at the same time, their ability to influence American politics has declined.

Enter Trump.

Working class white voters have been critical to Trump's success. Throughout the Republican primaries, Trump's victories were bolstered by support from whites without degrees. Across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, Trump averaged 50% support among white non-college GOP primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees.

And across five CNN/ORC polls conducted since the primaries ended in June, Trump's lead among white non-college voters averages 29 points, while white college voters have broken in Clinton's direction by an average of 8 points.

Restated in terms similar to the oft-cited gender gap, that adds up to a 37-point education gap among whites. According to exit polls back to 1980, it has never been larger than 14 points.

The white working class shifts Republican

Democrats used to be the party of the white working class, and Republicans, the party of the college educated. Those roles have flipped.

Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director for strategic partnerships at Atlantic Media who has reported extensively on this group, calls it class inversion.

"In the 50s, 60s, and 70s, Democrats ran better among non-college than college whites," he said. "Starting in the 80s, the two lines converged, and in 2000, (Al) Gore ran better among college than non-college whites, (John) Kerry ran 6 points better, Obama 7 points."

Some of that is due to the shifting economy. Working class whites were largely synonymous with union members, who are traditionally staunchly Democratic. As the service economy has grown and manufacturing declined, the profile of union members has changed. In 1980, 70% of all voters who came from union households were whites without college degrees; in 2012, the white working class made up just were 39% of voters from union households. Non-whites and white college graduates were each about 30% of the union vote in 2012, almost double their share of the 1980 vote, and those two groups are increasingly Democratic.

But some of it is their differing views on government and change in American society. Within the white working class, those who consider themselves Democrats and those who say they are Republican tend to agree in their assessment of how the working class is doing. About 7 in 10 working class white voters in each party say it's gotten harder for people like them to find good jobs, and narrow majorities of both say the government isn't doing enough to help "people like you."

And while they don't see exactly eye-to-eye on immigration or the increasing diversity of the United States, both sets of partisans are more apt than their college-educated counterparts to see a negative side to the country's shifting demographics. Both working class white Democrats and Republicans are more likely than white college educated partisans to feel that the country's increasing racial and ethnic diversity is harmful because it leaves some people feeling left behind. The same pattern emerges in perceptions of immigrants, with white non-college partisans more apt than white partisans with degrees to say immigrants today are a burden on the United States and that the government should attempt to deport all immigrants currently living in the US illegally.

And in a party whose second-place finisher for this year's presidential nomination considers himself a socialist, working-class white Democrats are less apt than their college-educated counterparts to consider themselves liberal or to be non-religious, two factors that could be driving them away from the Obama-era Democratic Party.

Among white working class Democrats who are registered to vote, 22% say they would consider voting for Trump, vs. just 2% among white Democrats with college degrees, and nearly a quarter, 23%, say they will definitely not vote for Clinton, a figure that stands at 3% among white Democrats with college degrees.

The effects of this shift are showing in recent swing-state polling. Trump's best chance to win the presidency comes by flipping rust-belt states where Democrats have had natural advantages in recent presidential elections and which have larger than average blocs of white non-college voters -- Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin among them. In each, Trump has cut into Clinton's advantage with broad support from the white working class.

In the pure battlegrounds, Ohio and Iowa also appear to be shifting Trump's way on the strength of his support among white non-college voters.

"Democrats have run slightly better among blue-collar whites in Midwestern swing states, and that has been a key to them holding those states," said Brownstein.

Will they vote?

Majorities of voters across partisan, education, and racial lines say they are dissatisfied with the influence that people like them have on the political process. But there are broader differences when asked about the likelihood of actually turning out to impact that process.

In the CNN/KFF Poll, 71% of white non-college voters said they always vote in presidential elections, and 79% rated the chances that they would vote a 10 out of 10. But both figures were smaller than among whites who do have college degrees, about 9 in 10 in that group said they always vote and would be very likely to this time around.

But a CNN/ORC poll in early September found almost no difference between whites with degrees and those without in terms of enthusiasm about voting this year. Forty-two percent of white college graduates were extremely or very enthusiastic, as were 43% of white non-college registered voters.

Should turnout levels among whites without degrees, whites with degrees and non-whites continue along their current trajectory, the white working class would likely emerge from 2016 still the largest voting bloc in the country in terms of race and educational attainment, for what may be the last time.

The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites -- white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school.

__label__politics Welch, West Virginia (CNN) Each morning for the last 65 years, 93-year-old Ed Shepard has walked to work to open up the Union 76 service station, here in rolling hills of West Virginia coal country.

When he looks out his window, he can see a sweeping mural that shows what life in Welch used to be like. A United Cigars shop on one side of the street, a Western Union sign on the other. Lines of cars stretch into the distance. Even Shepard himself -- who is as much a fixture of Welch as any of its buildings -- is in the mural, a blue cap perched on his head.

"There wasn't ten square feet in this town that didn't have a successful business in it, a business of every kind," Shepard said in an interview. "No matter what you wanted or needed, you could buy it in Welch."

Those were better days.

Now it's a place, people who live here say, that politicians use as a convenient photo op and that the federal government has left behind, a sentiment common among white working class voters. 56% of non-college educated whites say the government in Washington does not represent them, according to a new poll conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation. And two-thirds say they are dissatisfied with the influence people like them have on politics.

Locals referred to the once-bustling Welch as "Little New York," but now the town and the county around it are slowly slipping away. The storefronts are empty. The buildings and houses here are now crumbling with decay. Shepard used to take checks to the bank each Monday -- sometimes $1,000, sometimes $1,500. He hasn't had to do that in four or five years he said, because he hasn't had one customer in that long.

"It's depressing to watch the population disappear, the businesses disappear and the activity stop. Back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, it was hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and there's nobody." -- Ed Shepard, 93.

"It's depressing to watch the population disappear, the business disappear and the activity to stop," he said. "Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, it'd be hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and there's nobody."

McDowell County's population is just 19,835 down from 100,000 in the 1950s. That decline is expected to continue. West Virginia University economists estimate that McDowell will continue to lose residents at a rate of 1% each year.

Some, particularly in rural areas like McDowell County, say the government's at fault. Rural working class whites are more likely to blame the federal government for their economic problems than their urban counterparts. Seven in ten say the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for the economic problems facing the working class, in the CNN Kaiser survey, compared with half of urban working class whites. That could explain the appeal of a candidate who is not only intent on upsetting the political system, but has at times seemed bent on breaking it down to start over again.

On this winding drive through the hilly roads of Appalachia, there are few signs signaling support for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but Trump is expected to do well here. West Virginia hasn't voted for a Democrat since Bill Clinton's second term. Much has changed in the last 20 years and now Clinton is seen as squarely at odds with the coal industry, which is the bedrock of Welch and the surrounding county.

No matter who wins in November, some residents of West Virginia coal country don't believe anything will change their lives. They have come to accept, as Gary Hall, a 55-year-old Trump supporter put it, "that next year is going to be worse than the last year" no matter who is president.

"When we have a natural disaster in the country, everybody shows up. We're the same as a natural disaster without the effects, without the storm, or without the flood. ... Hopefully we can get it turned around and hopefully we'll get some attention from Washington." -- Cecil Patterson, 51 (left in photo)

Hall said he felt alienated from the political process, but rejected the idea that he and other whites without college degrees were angry and flocking to Trump as a result. The CNN/Kaiser foundation survey suggests that's the case, too. Just 19% of working class white voters described themselves as angry about how things are going in their own lives.

"We're conditioned that there's really nothing you can do about it. The only thing outrage and protesting and stuff does is cause bad feelings," he said. "People are just resigned to have what they have. The ones that want to leave, the ones that can leave and want to leave leave. Everybody else just stays here."

Rural working class white voters like Hall are more likely to say America's best days are behind us and that their children will be worse off than they are today. In the CNN/Kaiser survey, 58% of rural working class whites say America's best days have come and gone and 57% say their children will be worse off compared with less than half of urban working class whites who say the same.

West Virginia is one of the nation's largest coal-producing states and McDowell County used to produce more coal than any county here. But there's been a steep downturn in coal jobs across the state due to competition with cheaper natural gas, tougher environmental rules and mechanization, and this county has seen the worst of it.

"We don't have another option," said Cecil Patterson, 51, who spent his life working in the coal industry and serves on McDowell County's county commission. "Once we shut down the coal industry here there's nowhere to go, there's nothing else to do, there's no other jobs available."

The unemployment rate here was 12.5% in July, compared with 4.9% nationwide.

When work dries up, people leave, Patterson said, doing anything they can to make ends meet.

"She [Hillary Clinton] wants to shut down the coal industry -- that's gonna put me out of a job. Wouldn't be real smart to vote for somebody who's gonna put you out of a job." -- Ryan Barnette, 34

"You can't just go to the next county here, you have to leave the state. A man tries to go out of the state, maintain an apartment, try to keep his home back up here, it just puts such a struggle on the family."

Trump won McDowell handily in West Virginia's May primary, taking 91.5% of the Republican vote -- his largest margin of victory in the country. But even before becoming his party's presumptive nominee the week prior, he was the favorite to win in the state.

During a campaign rally in West Virginia in May, Trump promised to bring back lost-coal mining jobs but hasn't said how he'd pull it off. Many people here were skeptical that he could -- but credit him with giving them hope.

And animosity toward Clinton runs high. Even months later, people still repeat -- verbatim -- the comment Clinton made that her climate change policies would "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."

Many people here with ties to the coal industry -- virtually everyone here is linked to it -- see Clinton's comments about coal disqualifying and Trump as their only answer.

"It ain't gonna be Hillary," said 34-year-old Ryan Barnette, his face black with soot, minutes after leaving the mine. "She wants to shut down the coal industry -- that's gonna put me out of a job."

"Our main industry has been coal. When you don't diversify and have other means, then the coal miners are laid off, either they stay and have no money to spend, which trickles down everywhere... Or they eventually have to pack up and move so that they can find work." -- Elaine LaCaria, 54

Elaine Lacaria -- known here as Laney -- was a lifelong Democrat and voted for Clinton eight years ago. But now things have changed.

"I won't vote for her again. No, never," she said in an interview in the dress shop she opened in 2008, the same year then-Senator Barack Obama was elected president.

In the eight years since then, she said things have gotten worse. Jobs have dried up, people are leaving and not coming back and addiction has ravaged this community and others near it.

"When we drive anywhere you see small town USA is no more," Lacaria said. "This has affected all of us, not just the coal fields."

Lacaria said she'll never vote for a Democrat again and this year, she'll support Trump.

"When I see Trump as a businessman, I think he will help our county definitely, but I think he will help our country as a whole. He knows what he's doing."

Patterson, who also said he plans to vote for Trump due to his support of the coal industry, said the same.

"When we wake up the morning after an election, our roads are going to be getting worse, our sewer, our water, our schools are failing, Patterson said. "They want us to keep paying more and we keep getting less, so there's my take on where we're at the day after the election."

"We look different, we talk different, and people seem to think we don't exist. But if you're hungry, we'll split our last meal with you. If you're cold, we'll get you some kind of--to stay warm. We give everything that we got. And we get nothing back." -- Vira Rose, 69

Others, like 69-year-old Vira Rose, say no politician or government got them in this position. And they don't expect to be saved.

Rose, who was one of the first women to work as a mine foreman in the area, owns her own auto repair shop. She once sold new tires, now a stack of used tires for sale sits outside of the shop. People can't afford new ones anymore, she said.

"Sometimes I come here at 8 a.m., I get out of here at 8 or 9 at night. Any job comes, you don't turn it down and say tomorrow. If you say tomorrow, tomorrow won't be here. You grab it, you do it -- then you help others," she said. "We're the forgotten tribe."

She has no faith in Clinton or Trump.

"What am I gonna do? I'm not gonna vote for neither damn one of them," Rose said. "Because there's not much difference, there's really not."

In 2014, ISIS captured Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. This past October, Iraqi forces began offensive to retake the city. Since then, intense fighting made life unbearable for Mosul's civilians. The bloodshed caused significant displacement of people caught in the crossfire. More than 742,000 people left Mosul, according to the UN.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) On the surface, Ann Bryant and Jennifer Gibson could not be more alike.

Both are white women without college degrees. Both live in North Carolina. Both think America's best days are ahead of it.

But their shared optimism stems from sharply different assessments of the country's current state of affairs. Bryant, a retired nurse who says she lives comfortably in New Bern, North Carolina, sees an improving economy, neighbors whose children are purchasing their first homes and general prosperity. She also says she will probably vote for Hillary Clinton.

"I see improvement in people's wages," said Bryant, who declined to give her age except to say that she is a senior citizen.

"The way they dress. When I go to the grocery store, I see people with big baskets of food. People look like they're doing well. I just think that things are better all the way around."

For her part, Gibson, 63, sees a country overrun by immigrants and refugees with alien values, living on the dole, taking jobs and benefits away from native-born Americans.

She says political leaders in Washington are out of touch with the concerns of people like her and that her optimism for the future is based on her belief that Donald Trump will win the presidency.

"Right now everything is in one hell of a mess, and I believe that Trump is going to come in and clean things up," she said.

Far from a monolith

The white working class, which forms the core of Trump's support, is often treated as a monolithic entity, both in its beliefs and its images. But an extensive survey of whites with less than a four-year college degree conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation paints a picture of an often-ignored demographic that belies the stereotypic images of Midwestern steel workers toting lunch pails to work, or golden-hearted cashiers working at Walmart or laid-off coal miners in Appalachia sitting around, chugging beer and seething in resentment.

What the poll discovered is that, as much as the white working class differs in attitudes and experience from college-educated whites and from working-class blacks and Hispanics, it presents an intriguing mosaic within its demographic group.

Far from being monolithic, the white working class has sharp divisions based on age, geography, income, gender and religion. These differences show up in their views towards immigration and racial and ethnic diversity; optimism about the direction of their lives and their children's future; their opinion about government or their support for Donald Trump.

"We went into this poll trying to keep an open mind and not look at the white working class as a monolithic group," said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

For example, urban-dwelling members of the white working class are more optimistic about America's future than their counterparts in rural areas. Almost three-quarters of working-class whites younger than 30 who were surveyed believe increasing racial and ethnic diversity is enriching the country's culture, while about half of those older than 65 who were surveyed do.

Southern whites who have not attended college are twice as likely as those in other regions to say they have been negatively impacted by undocumented immigrants taking jobs in their community.

Southern working-class whites are the most pessimistic about the country's future. Only 37% of working-class whites in the South who were surveyed believe the country's "best days are ahead of us," compared to nearly half those in the West and 52% in the Northeast. Evangelical Christians and those living in rural areas tend to be the most downcast about the future.

JUST WATCHED White working class says Christian values under attack Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White working class says Christian values under attack 03:42

About 60% of working-class whites surveyed who say they are evangelical Christians say the country's best days are behind us, compared to 42% of Catholics, 53% of mainline Protestants and 42% who say they have no religion.

Similarly, 41% of those surveyed living in urban areas say America's best days are behind us, while nearly 60% of those in rural areas feel that way.

Wanting more from the government

Differences also show up strongly with regard to the anger that the white working class feels toward government. The survey found 69% of those earning less than $30,000 say the federal government is not doing enough to help them and people like them. That's more than twice the 31% of those earning $75,000 or more who feel that way.

"You can go back the last 50 years and it's always the same," says Tim Bequette, 56, a retired truck driver who lives on disability in Farmington, Missouri. "Politicians make all kinds of promises. But when they get elected they only pay attention to people who have money. If you've got money, you can get what you want. If you don't have money, nothing happens."

Ironically, or perhaps due to the fact that their incomes are lower, a larger percentage of people, 63%, who receive at least one government benefit, excluding Social Security and Medicare, say the government isn't doing enough for them. That's compared to the 47% who feel that way even though they receive no government aid.

Fully 71% of rural working-class whites blame the government for economic problems facing the working class, compared to 51% of working-class whites who live in cities. Rage at the government is felt most acutely by older white working-class men. Nearly 80% of the men over than age of 50 who were surveyed say the government bares all or most of the blame for the problems facing the white working class. About 53% of women in that age group who were polled agree.

But despite the anger expressed toward the government and the pessimism about the country's future, majorities of working-class whites surveyed -- regardless of age, income, region, religion and gender -- say they are satisfied with their personal financial situation.

"I'm pretty happy overall with the place that I am," said Amanda, 28, who lives in Overton, Texas, and only wants to be identified by her first name. "I have a low mortgage. My kids are going to good schools. My job is relatively stable."

Chad Fritz, 42, says he is not concerned about immigrants. "Trade deals concern me more," he says. "I'm more concerned about losing jobs than people taking jobs, which is what many people say immigrants do. But I feel the jobs they're taking are jobs Americans don't really want to do. I don't want to go pick apples and oranges, and those are the type of jobs immigrants are doing."

Fritz lives in Delaware, Ohio. He is a stay-at-home dad, taking care of his one-year-old son during the week while his wife works as a CPA in nearby Columbus. On many weekends he works as a glass blower.

The Columbus metro area is an economic powerhouse with low unemployment, rising home prices and high median incomes. Fritz acknowledges that the strength of the local economy influences his attitude.

"Columbus is a growing city," he said. "It's booming. It's doing very well. There are lots of jobs. I might have a different view if I lived somewhere else."

The politics of the white working class

While support for Trump is relatively strong across the board among working-class whites, there are significant differences among different groups.

Men over the age of 50 are among the Republican nominee's strongest backers with 68% of voters in this group saying they would consider voting for him, compared to 51% of women who are 50 years or older.

Rural (68%), suburban (66%) and Southern (70%) working-class white voters voice support for Trump in larger numbers than urban dwellers (49%) and those living in the West (54%) and Midwest (53%). And 78% of working-class white voters surveyed who say immigrants are a burden on the country say they would consider voting for him, compared to 38% who of those who believe immigrants strengthen the country.

Amanda, of Overton, Texas, and Ann Bryant say they are supporting Clinton. Bequette and Jennifer Gibson back Trump. Chad Fritz is undecided, but doesn't like either Trump or Clinton. He is trying to decide between Green Party nominee Jill Stein and the Libertarian candidate (Gary Johnson), whose name he couldn't remember.

Working-class whites are clearly more hostile to immigration and the nation's increasing racial and ethnic diversity.

Respondents were asked which comes closer to their view: that immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents, or immigrants are a burden on the country because they take our jobs, housing and health care. Nearly half (47%) of those surveyed say it's the latter.

More than half (55%) say they think the government should try to deport all people living in the country illegally.

Also, compared to college-educated whites or black or Hispanic working-class people, working-class whites are more likely to say immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks or that recent immigrants from Latin America take jobs away from Americans or add to the crime problem.

"Obama agreed to let all them refugees come in and give them a place to live," said Bequette, the retired truck driver. "Yet you see hundreds of thousands of Vietnam vets living on the streets. The politicians are more worried about being politically correct and about what other countries think about us than they do Americans."

But that hostility is not shared equally across the board.

Sixty-one percent of rural white working-class surveyed say the government should try to deport all those in the country illegally, compared to 49% of urban dwellers.

Moreover, compared to other religions, evangelical Christians are more likely to say that increasing diversity is threatening, rather than enriching American culture; believe that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorism, add to the crime problem, and take jobs away from Americans; and are less likely to say that these immigrants are "basically good, honest people."

"Half the people coming in are young men," Gibson, who describes herself as Pentecostal, says of Muslim refugees. "I feel sorry for the women and children. We need to make a place for them over there. The guys? I don't feel sorry for them at all. They need to turn their asses around and pick up a gun and fight for their country. Our guys are fighting for their country. They should too, instead of running over here."

Fritz, who says he has no problems with immigrants, says he was raised Catholic but hasn't been to church in 20 years. "I'm not a church-type person," he says. "But, from a sense of morals, I like to think I have Christian values."
__label__world At least that's how I remember it. I was 7.

I'm wedged between a cousin and my father, my grandmother perched behind. We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.

"Drive!" we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.

But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.

The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.

My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.

"Don't shoot the elephant," my gran cries and smacks him.

It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.

I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk; we can see the horizon through its legs.

My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.

Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.

We are safe. Right around the corner, the truck's axle breaks in an aardvark hole.

My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected -- even feared.

It means no worries

Imagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.

The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.

The guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.

"Shouldn't we keep it on," I say, "and maybe not be so close."

"The elephants here are relaxed," he smiles, "Hakuna Matata."

Meaning: "No worries."

I can't understand it. The elephants don't charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.

To be sure, elephants can be dangerous -- and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasn't been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.

The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.

The elephants knew.

"Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk," Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where he's been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continent's savanna elephant populations.

"This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching," says Chase.

As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.

And they remember.

No, they don't forget

It's sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize -- to give an animal human characteristics -- but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.

I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNN's most experienced field producers.

Ingrid's connection to Botswana runs deep.

In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.

She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNN

Ingrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.

Shireni's handler taught her a trick: to remove her handler's hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handler's. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.

Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.

"She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives," says Ingrid. ""Shireni hadn't done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered."

Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.

Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them -- good and bad.

Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say "hello."

Vanishing herds

Despite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants can't escape the ravages of humans.

Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks.

Before European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants; by 1979 only 1.3 million remained -- and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.

In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.

As of July, Africa's savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census . Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.

And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.

"When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, it's incredibly disheartening," says Chase.

"Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted."

In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africa's "haven" that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.

But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.

Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted. Mike Chase, Great Elephant Census

Botswana is fighting an unconventional war to try to stop the slaughter, with the Botswana Defense Force mobilized throughout the border region.

More than 700 specially trained soldiers are stationed in 40 bases in the far north.

That protection no longer seems enough.

A new memory

From a distance, it appears the elephant could be resting. But the smell reveals the truth.

A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana. His face hacked off by poachers.

As we approach, we see the tusks have been taken. The trunk is 10 paces from the body. The carcass is perhaps two or three days old. And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.

Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.

They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.

"I've been asked if I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africa's elephants," he says, "and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants."

This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Most white working-class voters who are evangelical Christians -- like most white evangelicals -- would consider voting for Donald Trump.

But it's not because they believe he shares their conservative Christian values. Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

While black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four -- 76% -- say they'd consider voting for Trump.

Partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans.

The majority -- 6 in 10 -- of voters in this group believe the US' better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today.

While most Christian groups -- 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics -- share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack.

Trump often says he wants to "make America great again," and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn't mean they don't question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness

"When listening to him, he's not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have," said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company.

"I don't know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him," said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. "That's the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn't like him."

Christian values seen as under attack

That dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it's clear who is at fault for many of the country's issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class.

"I don't think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration," said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. "Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like. Just a lot of things are said and done. It scares me."

JUST WATCHED Feeling helpless in WV: 'We are the forgotten tribe' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Feeling helpless in WV: 'We are the forgotten tribe' 04:50

Long, a Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative Christian values.

"I feel the country was founded on Christian principles. They came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs," she said. "And now, if our ministers don't marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail."

While same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples.

Darrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn't see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates.

"I don't see my values shaping the election. There's just a lot of mayhem," he said. "I think the values that were in the country's founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily."

Many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory.

"I don't know where I am," said Long. "I'm so confused at this point and time. I don't believe either one of them should be in office. I don't believe either one should be running."

Some have entertained third-party candidates.

"I'm sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can't stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I'm thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting," Mitchell said.

For these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years.

"If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we'd be in jail," Mitchell said. "But because she's the Democratic nominee, they don't hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people."

Many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith.

Security also a concern

But values aren't the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military.

"All these refugees they want to bring in, that's really got me going," said Pool, who participated in the survey. "They have no idea who they're bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here."

"I just think it's ludicrous and all it's for is so one party can have more voters," he said.

The relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump's proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn't mean some among their flock aren't anxious.

The majority -- 75% -- of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites.

"I say let's quit bringing these people in, period," Pool said. "I realize America is a melting pot and that's how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can't come to this country. Come on in. Let's do it the right way."

To understand how big of a deal that is you don't have to look much further than the definition of "mass extinction." It means that three-quarters of all species vanish -- forever.

In all of history, that's happened only five times.

The sixth extinction would be the first caused by humans.

"We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe," said Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University.

"It's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done."

I've been reporting on the coming extinction crisis this year for a CNN series called "Vanishing." And I can tell you that while this topic is enormously depressing, there is some good news: We know how to slow or hopefully stop the sixth extinction.

Anthony Barnosky, another extinction expert, also from Stanford, told me humans have at most 20 years to make sweeping changes about our relationship with nature. If we do that, he said, we can avoid the sixth extinction.

But here's what needs to happen, according to the experts.

1. Stop burning fossil fuels

JUST WATCHED If coral reefs disappear, so will they Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH If coral reefs disappear, so will they 06:08

Burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests is heating up the atmosphere. That's creating trouble for all corners of the natural world, from the Rocky Mountains, where the tiny pika is overheating , to the oceans, where coral reefs are being decimated as the oceans warm and become more acidic.

We know that to avert the worst of climate change we need to limit warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius . To do that, the world needs to be off fossil fuels this century -- hopefully closer to 2030 than 2100. That's a tall order, but Stanford University researchers have shown we can do it with existing technology like wind, solar and nuclear.

Policies that promote cleaner energy include carbon taxes, cap-and-trade pollution pricing systems and renewable energy tax credits. The Paris Agreement on climate change, ratified by the United States and 115 other countries , also creates a framework for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels. The Trump administration in the United States, however, threatens to move the world's second-biggest climate polluter away from that agreement and back towards dirty, climate-warming fuels.

2. Protect half the Earth's land -- and oceans

This idea comes from renowned biologist E.O. Wilson: Put aside half the surface of the Earth -- both land and oceans -- for the betterment of the nature and biodiversity. Maybe that sounds like a lot, but Wilson argues it's necessary if we want to avert crisis. Some 84% of species could be saved if we protected all that land. "That amount, as I and others have shown, can be put together from large and small fragments around the world to remain relatively natural, without removing people living there or changing property rights," Wilson wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times

3. Fight illegal wildlife trafficking

Some of the world's most iconic species -- particularly the elephant and rhino -- are threatened with extinction simply because people are slaughtering these majestic creatures to sell their body parts on the black market. Elephant ivory is carved into trinkets. And rhino horn is mistakenly sold as an aphrodisiac.

And there are other less-known markets, too, including those for pangolin meat (a delicacy), giraffe tails (bracelets) and tiger bone (medicine). Efforts to shut down these markets have been grossly inadequate, as the black market in environmental products is estimated to be worth $91 billion to $258 billion per year . Compare that to drug trafficking, the most lucrative black market, which is worth $344 billion per year, according to a United Nations and Interpol estimate.

Experts say better law enforcement is needed to stop poaching. And consumers -- especially those in Asia, where wildlife products tend to be popular -- need to stop buying these illegal and harmful goods. Groups like WildAid and Education for Nature Vietnam are using advertising campaigns to try to make these products seem uncool.

4. Slow human population growth

It sounds callous, but more people means more food, more land and more resources. Ehrlich, from Stanford, said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth's extinction crisis. The population was about 4 billion in 1980. It's now 7.4 billion and is rapidly heading for 9.7 billion by 2050 , according to the United Nations.

5. Reconnect with the natural world, and open our eyes

If there's a fact that underlies all this, perhaps it's this: We're no longer connected to nature. We don't understand it and therefore, naively, dangerously, we figure it's doing just fine or will rebound. Barnosky, the extinction expert from Stanford, said we think of the natural world like a bottomless checking account when we need to see it as a savings account.

We humans also have ridiculously short attention spans. Issues like extinction and climate change play out over decades, centuries and millennia. Our actions now -- or inaction -- will matter for thousands of years. "You can have catastrophic events that are seen in slow motion, basically, and not register on people very well," said Ehrlich. We must find a way to reconnect with nature and to see this wave of extinction for the crisis that it is.

__label__world Story highlights UN: 20 million people are in need of food across four countries

Famine in South Sudan alone has left 100,000 people on the verge of starvation

(CNN)

Twenty million people desperately need food assistance across four countries: Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeast Nigeria -- according to figures from the United Nations.

"We stand at a critical point in history, " UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O'Brien told the Security Council . "Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN."

Famine in South Sudan alone has left 100,000 people on the verge of starvation and almost 5 million people, more than 40% of the country's population, in need of urgent help, aid agencies say.

Somalia needs funds -- and quickly. In addition to drought and famine, diseases, like cholera and measles are spreading.

__label__world This story was first published in April, after the author attended an NRA convention. She reflected again on what she heard and saw this week after learning of the Las Vegas massacre on Monday, which was also Mahatma Gandhi's birthday.

Atlanta (CNN) Guns are not a part of the culture of my homeland, except perhaps for the occasional Bollywood movie in which the bad guy meets his demise staring down the wrong end of a barrel.

My childhood in India was steeped in ahimsa, the tenet of nonviolence toward all living things.

The Indians may have succeeded in ousting the British, but we won with Gandhian-style civil disobedience, not a revolutionary war.

I grew up not knowing a single gun owner, and even today India has one of the strictest gun laws on the planet. Few Indians buy and keep firearms at home, and gun violence is nowhere near the problem it is in the United States. An American is 12 times more likely than an Indian to be killed by a firearm, according to a recent study

It's no wonder then that every time I visit India, my friends and family want to know more about America's "love affair" with guns.

I get the same questions when I visit my brother in Canada or on my business travels to other countries, where many people remain perplexed, maybe even downright mystified, by Americans' defense of gun rights.

I admit I do not fully understand it myself, despite having become an American citizen nearly a decade ago. So when I learn the National Rifle Association is holding its annual convention here in Atlanta, right next to the CNN Center, I decide to go and find out more.

in the exhibitor's hall at the #nraam2017 in #atlanta. #nra #guns @cnn A post shared by Moni Basu (@mbasucnn) on Apr 28, 2017 at 9:24am PDT

My eyes open wide inside the vast and cavernous Georgia World Congress Center. I take in countless exhibits by the firearms industry and even check out a few guns. Among them are the Mossberg Blaze .22 semiautomatic Rimfire Rifle and an FN 509 semi-automatic 9mm pistol.

I've never had the desire to own a gun. I try hard to experience the excitement of others who are admiring these products.

Around me are 80,000 of America's fiercest patriots and defenders of guns. Many are wearing American flag attire and T-shirts with slogans like: "Veterans before refugees" and "God loves guns."

Few people here look like me. Most appear to be white and male. Many view the media, including my employer, with disdain -- and they do not hesitate to let me know.

I walk around with some trepidation, but I'm determined to strike up conversations. I begin with this question: "Why do you want to own an object that can kill another human being?"

The answers are varied, but they center on three main themes: freedom, self-defense and sport. The first type of response is rooted in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for the ownership of more than 300 million guns in America. How many other countries have the right to bear arms written into their very foundation? It's unique and because of that, foreigners often have trouble grasping it.

I meet Chris Styskal at a booth set up by the NRA Wine Club. Yes, a wine club for the almost 5 million members of the organization.

"Eat, sleep, go fishing. Drink, sleep, go shooting. In that order," Styskal jokes.

But then we get into serious talk. Gun ownership, he tells me, has its roots in the birth of this country.

"George Washington's army fought off the British with rifles," he says. "They overthrew an oppressive government."

His statement gives me pause. The gun laws in India stem from colonial rule, when the British aimed to quell their subjects by disarming them. Perhaps my Indian compatriots should consider the right to own guns from this perspective.

Styskal, 41, earned a degree in psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University, and tells me the prevailing belief that gun owners are not educated is simply wrong. He owns a collection of rifles and pistols at his home in Port Carbon, Pennsylvania, and last year he fired 100 rounds every week at a shooting range.

He says the Second Amendment is about much more than the right to bear arms. It's about freedom.

"We don't want any government telling us what we can and cannot do."

It's a thought echoed by Brickell "Brooke" Clark, otherwise known as the American Gun Chic. She has a website by that name and also a YouTube channel. Both are bathed in hues of pink and dedicated to her recently formed passion for guns.

I introduce myself to Clark as we await President Donald Trump's arrival at the convention. The darkened room is booming with NRA clips bashing everyone from Hillary Clinton to George Clooney.

"What would you tell my friends in India who say Americans are infatuated with guns?"

"I wouldn't say Americans have an obsession with guns," Clark says. "We have an obsession with being free."

I ask what the Second Amendment means to her.

"It means I can live my life without anyone overpowering me," she says. "It makes me equal with everyone else."

The great equalizer. I never thought of the Second Amendment in that way.

Self-protection, I discover, is a huge reason many Americans own firearms.

Take Chloe Morris. She was born in Atlanta to Filipino parents; on this day, she's brought her mother along to hear Trump, the first sitting President to speak at an NRA convention since Ronald Reagan.

Morris is 35, petite and soft-spoken, but she's fierce about her opinions on guns.

"I'm 5 feet tall and 100 pounds," she tells me. "I cannot wait for a cop to come save me when I am threatened with rape or death."

Morris was once opposed to guns. "Extremely opposed," she says.

She earned a master's degree in criminal justice from Georgia State University. "I know the law," she says. "For me guns were not the answer."

But a few years ago, a dear friend was assaulted in her own home in an upscale Atlanta subdivision. The incident struck fear in Morris. She would never let herself become a victim.

She took shooting classes and became a Glock instructor. "I teach for free. I want women to be safe.

"I own 10 guns. I have a 14-year-old son. I started teaching him to shoot when he was 5. I'm a lifetime member of the NRA."

She pauses, and her next sentence surprises me.

"I don't think I can even kill another person -- except when my life is in danger."

In a way, I understand her position. My first real exposure to guns came after I embedded with the US Army and Marines to report the Iraq War. As a journalist I never carried a weapon, though soldiers coaxed me to learn how to shoot an M16. My conversation with Morris reminded me of a night when we came under threat, and the platoon sergeant placed a 9mm pistol on my Humvee seat. I refused to take it but knew instantly what he was trying to tell me. What if I were the last one alive? How would I save myself?

Luckily, we were safe that night. But I've always wondered how I might have acted under a dreadful scenario.

Other NRA members I speak with also tell me they don't trust the police to arrive in time when they are in danger. Scott Long, 55, lives out in the country in Piketon, Ohio -- 25 miles away from the county sheriff.

"The police can't be there all the time," he says, looking at his wife, DeeDee, and their three young children, whom he's brought along to the convention for a mini family vacation. Their son Brody, 9, has been shooting at the pellet range and is excited about his first 20-gauge shotgun.

"Where we live, we can shoot in our backyard," says Long, who owns 25 guns and is enjoying checking out all the shiny new weapons exhibited here.

Such remoteness, too, is alien to me. I grew up in a city that now brims with some 16 million people on a working day. Firing guns in my grandfather's garden would not have been a good thing. I think about all the space we have in America. So many of us live far from other human beings. Like the Long family. Perhaps isolation adds to the need to own guns.

I move forward in my quest to know more.

I hear gun proponents express a dislike for big government. They stress individual liberties over the collective. For people who live in more socialist countries, it's another obstacle to understanding American gun culture.

there are many walls of #guns at the #nraam2017 in #atlanta. #nra #gun #atl @cnn A post shared by Moni Basu (@mbasucnn) on Apr 28, 2017 at 6:25am PDT

Near a stairway emblazoned with a giant Beretta, I speak with Derrick Adams. He's a 32-year-old electric lineman from Nottingham, Pennsylvania. He describes himself as part black, part Puerto Rican and part Caucasian.

"How many guns do you own?" I ask.

"Not enough," he replies.

He picked up his first Glock when he was 22, and his first shot shattered a whole bunch of stereotypes.

"People look at guns as this evil tool whose job it is to kill," he says. "They're not at all that. They are about protection."

Adams believes that if all law-abiding citizens were armed, crime would drastically go down. He tells me that Chicago would not have such a high gun homicide rate if good folks in the inner cities were armed to fight "thugs and gangs."

"Stop looking to government to help us. They are not our parents," Adams says.

Liberals in America who want more gun control, says Adams, want to keep minorities and poor people dependent on government. Gun control started after slavery ended and was a way to keep black people disarmed, he says.

"You idiots," Adams says, referring to all people of color. "It was invented to suppress you."

He looks at me as though to say: You should know better.

Again, I think of colonialism in my homeland and how the British passed strict gun control to keep Indians from rising up.

Fighting tyranny and oppression is something Jaasiel Rubeck considers, too. The 29-year-old wife and mother from Columbus, Ohio, immigrated to this country from her native Venezuela when she was 6. People who live under authoritarian regimes should all understand the need to own a gun, she tells me.

Rubeck's words remind me of a friend from Iraq who wished she could own a gun during Saddam Hussein's rule. After he was overthrown, she slept with an AK-47 under her pillow at the height of the insurgency. She has always spoken of her love-hate relationship with guns. She wants to protect her family, but she is tired of the eternal violence plaguing her land. She wishes now that every gun would disappear from Iraq.

What I hear from speakers at the NRA convention, though, is that a peaceful world is a utopian fantasy -- and that the need for guns will always exist.

"The NRA saved the soul of America," says Chris Cox, the executive director of the organization.

I leave the convention trying to reconcile what I've gathered on this day with the philosophy of nonviolence with which I was raised. I am not certain that vast cultural differences can be bridged in a few hours, but I am glad I got a glimpse into the world of guns. I have much to consider.
__label__world Story highlights Since 1955, Everest's official height has been 8,848 meters

Studies show that there might have been some elevation changes over the years

In the past, Nepal has rejected height measurements calculated by foreign teams

(CNN) Did Mount Everest shrink after Nepal's massive 2015 earthquake? Has it lost a few meters of snow cover due to global warming? Is it getting taller due to shifting continental plates?

To clear up these frequently raised questions once and for all, the Nepalese government has kicked off the long and arduous mission of re-measuring the height of the world's tallest peak.

In 1856, Everest's height was first calculated to be 8,840 meters (29,002 feet) above sea level by a team led by British surveyor Sir George Everest, the man whom the mountain was named after. Later, in 1955, the figure was adjusted by eight meters to 8,848 (29,028 feet), which has remained the official height to date.

Climbers stand on a ridge over a valley leading north into the Khumbu region as they try to get a clear view of Mt. Everest, April 18, 2015.

"Since multiple scientific studies show that there might have been some changes in the height of Everest, it became the Nepali government's responsibility to check and clarify the matter," Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, director general of Nepal's Survey Department, told CNN.

Bhatta said his office had been planning to undertake the mission since 2012, but it never materialized. Strong doubts from the international scientific community that Everest's elevation changed after 2015's 7.8-magnitude earthquake gave the department a push to jump-start the project.

__label__world Humboldt County, California (CNN) Elle Snow laces up her combat boots, prepared once again, to go to war with "The Game."

"The [purchasers] really want new products all the time," says Snow. "The [sex] traffickers like to move their victims frequently so they can't get to know anyone and it's harder for law enforcement to track them."

For Snow, a native of Eureka, a town in rural northern California, this fight against sex trafficking is personal. She says she was 19 when she was first approached by an older man, who expressed an interest in dating her.

"I met my trafficker the same way a lot of us do," says Snow. "You always hear, 'I met a guy.' And he was here in rural Humboldt County and we kept bumping into each other. I took this as fate and he portrayed it that way. He met my mom, he met my family. I didn't realize that I had been marked."

'This is how prostitutes are made'

For Snow, it seemed to be a whirlwind, intoxicating romance.

But that quickly changed, once her boyfriend invited her to Sacramento and got her away from her family and friends.

"The next morning, I woke up and this man was standing in front of me. He had these 6 inch heels which I've never worn heels in my life being 6 feet tall and this little pink skirt. I've never worn pink in my life. And he wanted me to put these on and told me I had to get to work."

Elle Snow

At first Snow thought he was joking.

"I told him 'I'm on vacation, like, what are you talking about?' And he's telling me you're not you anymore. This is not your name. Your name is now 'Angel.'" Snow recalls.

"There was no way to get out of this situation. He took my clothes, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and eventually he started saying he is not who he said he was, that he's actually a pimp, and this is how prostitutes are made."

Snow wanted to run, but the trafficker threatened to harm her 14-year-old sister.

"The next thing I know was being taken to a brothel," Snow says. "I was trafficked throughout the [San Francisco] Bay Area for eight months of my life."

He was dragging my body to a car when I woke up. Elle Snow, trafficking survivor, founder "Game Over"

Snow says she tried to escape several times. Usually her trafficker would laugh at her, but one time in particular stands out, when an attempt to leave became physical and she feared her life was at risk.

"I punched him and knocked his tooth out and he got up; I ran into the bathroom. And then for the next few hours I was beat bloody," she recalls. "I was strangled. He was dragging my body to a car when I woke up. My throat was so swollen and black and blue. I still have busted capillaries in it from all that."

Surviving 'The Game'

Snow eventually managed to escape with the help of a friend. In 2014, she testified against her trafficker, David Bernard Anderson, who was on trial, accused of trafficking a 16-year-old girl.

Anderson, who went by the moniker "King David," was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison.

During that time, Snow realized Anderson was one of many men and women following a set of carefully laid-out rules and guidelines for how to force women into prostitution.

"What happened to me was called 'The Game,' this monstrous beast that is this world of sex trafficking," she explains. "These guys have a complete structure, they have books, they have documentaries, they have podcasts."

Kyla Baxley was the lead investigator on the case, for Humboldt County's District Attorney's Office.

"It's important to remember victims of sexual assault and exploitation didn't choose this," says Baxley. "Realizing that it was happening here in Humboldt, and having an interaction with Elle Snow, being one of the victims, really helped raised awareness of this issue in the community."

Humboldt County District Attorney Investigator Kyla Baxley was named "Investigator of the Year" by the California Sexual Assault Investigators Association.

And through the course of the trial, Snow came to two important conclusions. None of this was her fault and it hadn't happened by accident.

In 2016, she founded the anti-trafficking non-profit Game Over , dead-set on protecting other girls from the trauma and misery she went through herself.

"I called Kyla and I told her, I'm going to do something about this," says Snow. "I'm going to make the world know about 'The Game.' They need to know or else they are susceptible to it."

Fighting back

Now Snow spends many of her days monitoring sex ads on online classified sites, looking for trends.

"I am looking to see who they're coming in with, this someone showing up and then the same day another person showing up with the same area code.

"And I'm looking for tattoos because traffickers like to brand their victims. The brandings tend to consist nowadays mainly of names. Especially names with a crown on the chest or neck. Also, anything to do with currency, diamonds, money bags as well as anything to do with 'loyalty to the family,' 'loyalty to the game,' 'made by,' or 'property of.'"

In addition to investigating real-time cases of human trafficking herself, Snow is also training law enforcement and speaking to local schools.

Recently, she co-wrote and produced a play with three students from the Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre. Called "Jane Doe in Wonderland," it's a modern re-interpretation of the Lewis Carroll classic, based on Snow's own experiences. CNN attended a recent evening performance in front of a packed house at Eureka High School.

A scene from Jane Doe in Wonderland.

"If you're putting posters everywhere and everybody's talking about it and they're saying, 'Hey, I know what a pimp is. I know those books.' Then all of a sudden the traffickers don't feel comfortable anymore," says Snow.

All of a sudden the traffickers don't feel comfortable anymore. Elle Snow, trafficking survivor, founder "Game Over"

Rex Bohn, Humboldt County's 1st District Supervisor, was in attendance that night. He says he's been impressed on how quickly Snow's made a difference in this community.

He says: "Elle's raised, through her own experience, the level of understanding for our local police, our local sheriff's department."

In Elle Snow, it seems "The Game" may have met a young woman it can't beat.

And traffickers in Northern California should be on guard, listening for Snow's hard-soled footsteps, and the legion of newly informed supporters, charging up behind them.
__label__world Story highlights In 2013, CNN reported on child sex trafficking in Cambodia

CNN returns to the village of Svay Pak, a child trafficking hot spot

Svay Pak, Cambodia (CNN) Sephak was aged just 13 years old when she was sold for sex by her mother.

She was taken to a hospital, issued a certificate confirming her virginity, and then taken to a hotel room where a she was raped for days. She was returned home after three nights.

Sephak grew up in Svay Pak, a poor fishing village on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. It's a community that has become notorious as a place to buy child sex.

Her mother, Ann, said her family had fallen on hard times and that they took out a loan that eventually spiraled to about $6,000 in debt. With money-lenders threatening her, Ann took up an offer from a woman who approached her promising big money for her daughter's virginity.

Sephak said her mother was paid $800. But after Sephak's return, her mother began pressuring her to work in a brothel.
__label__world They're learning at a first grade level. Neat rows of students read the local language, Khmer, out loud. The 16-year-old off to the side stands out. He's the only one in the uniformed group wearing long sleeves in the sweltering heat.

Phea Chantheng says he's afraid of the sight of his own hand. He doesn't even like to think about how the accident happened. At the Marist School for children with disabilities, outside Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, the teachers have seen this kind of injury before.

Usually the arms are amputated below the shoulder, sometimes below the elbow.

"It's an obscene accident. It happens more than once on the same machines in some places," says Brother Terry Heinrich, one of the founders of the religious school. He counts about 20 students who have come through his classroom in about as many years with the tell-tale sign of "the accident."

"They are pushing clay into a crusher, their hands are caught, dragged into the machine. Arms are crushed. They have to stand there while the machine is dismantled to get them out," says Heinrich.

Chantheng kept his arm but he was left with a mangled hand. He was working in a brick factory when his feet slipped out from under him and his hand got caught.

It happened two years ago, and 25 miles from the school a catholic mission helped get him into. The memory stings.

He was 14 at the time at the time of the accident; his mother says that since the age of 11 he had been pitching in at the brick factory where his mother worked, loading bricks onto a cart and hauling them off to dry.

When she can't work anymore, she says they'll be responsible for paying off the debt she owes to the owner of the factory where she works.

She says that 15 years ago she took a $12 loan from a brick factory owner that has ballooned to $2,800-worth of debt.

Over the years, she moved between different brick-making factories. Each time, she says, the new owner bought the debt she owed the previous owner. And then she'd owe a little bit more.

Like other brick kiln workers, she's paid by the brick. She says that much of her meager wages must go toward paying off the debt; there's barely any money to survive on. When there's not enough for necessities, she has to borrow more.

"This is the life of a brick kiln worker," she says.

To make more bricks, and earn more money, Mok Thy says it's typical for parents working at brick kilns to put their children to work alongside them.

At brick factories outside of Phnom Penh, CNN saw children involved in the brick-making process.

'A sense of hopelessness'

In 2016, A Cambodian NGO called LICADHO sent researchers to dozens of brick kilns outside of Phnom Penh after being contacted by a group of families whose children were injured in accidents similar to Chantheng's.

"Often there's a sense of guilt [for the families and the children], there's a sense of hopelessness, there's depression, there's bullying by other kids and parents and other people who don't understand -- and there's lifetime pain depending on where the injury is," says Naly Pilorge, the deputy director of advocacy for LICADHO.

In December 2016, LICADHO published a report determining that the risk of injuries to children in the kilns remains high. The same report alleges widespread abuses including child labor and bonded labor in the brick factories that are doing big business, fueling Cambodia's building boom. The US State Department considers bonded labor to be a form of modern slavery.

Cambodia's Labor Ministry refutes the findings of the LICADHO report. Child labor and bonded labor are illegal under Cambodian law.

The law isn't being enforced, according to Pilorge. "[entire families] are just working. Working nonstop. Whatever money they get barely covers their food. It doesn't make any difference towards reduction of their debt.

"What we found is not only that children were working besides dangerous machinery but we were also finding out that entire families were coerced or forced or tricked into bonded labor."

CNN visited brick kilns where workers said their debt to factory owners ranged from hundreds to thousands of US dollars. The going rate per brick is a fraction of a cent according to LICADHO. The equation makes it impossible for workers to pay down debt while earning enough for basics.

But the Labor Ministry insists the illegal practice of debt bondage isn't flourishing in the kilns as LICADHO claims; in fact, the Ministry says the practice doesn't exist at all.

"Debt bondage is the direct debt between employer and workers. This is debt borrowing," insists Veng Heang, director of the Labor Ministry's Child Labor Department.

Veng calls it a legal system of advance loans, but he says the distinction from debt bondage is "confusing" and for that reason, the practice should stop. One brick kiln owner we spoke to on the outskirts on Phnom Penh told us all her workers owe her money, because she gives them advance loans for things like weddings and to cover the expense of births.

"Their lives here are good because the bills are put on me," she says. "When they give birth, we pay; when they get married, we also pay. So their debts increase because they borrow our money."

Veng also says a successful government campaign against child labor has wiped out the problem in the kilns entirely. The success, he says, started with a campaign to get children out of the kilns launched back in 2006.

Six hundred government employees are assigned to inspect nearly 400 brick kilns. The Labor Ministry says they haven't identified a single case that qualifies as child labor since 2012.

Children in the kilns

During the week that a CNN crew spent filming at brick factories outside of Phnom Penh, we saw children involved with various steps of the brick-making process, in every factory we visited. We can't verify the ages of some of the children, or if the type of work they were doing would be considered illegal.

All the children we met said they were helping out their families without being paid.

The Labor Ministry responded by saying that workers may be older than they look and that while labor is illegal for children under 15, light work is allowed for children aged 12 and over.

That's not the kind of work Chantheng was doing two years ago. His mother no longer works on the machine that scarred her son. She's moved on to another kiln where she spends her days hauling carts weighed down with bricks.

Carrera says she found work on a farm, and it wasn't long before her supervisor tried to take advantage of her. He promised her an easier job inside a warehouse. But as soon as she got in his truck, she says, he drove to a remote part of the farm and tried to force her to have sex with him.

"He told me if we don't do this the easy way, we'll do it the hard way. I was afraid and trembling," she says.

Now 35, Carrera recalls with gratitude the farmworker who heard her screams and rescued her before she could be raped. She also remembers how they both were fired the next day.

Protections against that type of labor abuse against migrant workers in the United States were virtually non-existent in the 1990's.

"No one knew anything about rights," Carrera says. "We didn't seek out what our worker rights were. We just accepted everything they told us and just did our jobs."

Coalition of Immokalee Workers

In 1993, a group of American activists and migrant farmworkers decided to change that. They founded the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to improving wages and working conditions of migrant farmworkers.

The organization is named after the migrant town of Immokalee, Florida, the epicenter of tomato production in the United States. Ninety-percent of all winter tomatoes consumed in the US come from Florida. Immokalee also used to be known as ground zero for modern day slavery.

CIW co-founder Laura Germino explains how the group evolved into an anti-slavery organization.

"We began to come across situations where workers were being held against their will, where they weren't free to leave," Germino says.

The first case they discovered was eventually prosecuted in a federal case called U.S. vs Flores.

"In that one, we found out that workers were being held by armed guards, prevented from leaving, pistol whipped, some sexually assaulted, and it was a crew of 500 workers," says Germino.

Germino says she and her colleagues initially thought it was just a single case. An anomaly, she says.

"But then we came across another case and another case and that's how I became introduced to labor trafficking."

Since that first case, the CIW has uncovered and helped the US government successfully prosecute eight cases of slave labor on Florida farms.

The cases are highlighted in a mobile museum that Germino uses to educate people about the issue.

Fair Food Program

Today, the CIW's focus is no longer uncovering cases of slavery. Instead, it's aim is preventing them from happening in the first place through an initiative it calls the Fair Food Program.

Participants in the program, which include 90% of tomato growers in Florida , allow CIW staff to come onto their properties and hold mandatory education sessions for all employees. The workers receive booklets that outline their rights and a hotline to call if they experience violations.

The growers also agree to regular third-party inspections of their farms. When they visit, a team of auditors speaks confidentially with at least 50% of workers to ensure their rights are being respected.

The Fair Food Program operates in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey.

Laura Safer Espinoza is a former Supreme Court Justice for the State of New York. She now spends her retirement in Florida, running the Fair Food Standards Council, which oversees the audits.

"Places that were called ground zero for modern day slavery by federal prosecutors a few years ago are now cited by national and international human rights experts as the best work environment in U.S. agriculture," she says.

Judge Laura, as she is affectionately called by everyone who works with her, says the code works because it was created by the very people it is designed to protect.

"The code that we get to monitor and enforce is unique because it was written by workers who are the ultimate experts on human rights in the agricultural settings in which they work."

The program also includes real market consequences for farms if violations are found.

Workers pick tomatoes on a farm in Immokalee, Florida.

As Judge Laura explains, "if a participating grower is not complying with the code of conduct after multiple chances and opportunities with the Fair Food Standards Council to work toward compliance, ultimately they are suspended. That means they cannot sell their produce to now 14 major retail buyers."

Those buyers include many of the biggest fast food restaurants and grocery stores, including McDonalds, Taco Bell, Whole Foods Market and Walmart. As part of the agreement, they all pledge to purchase tomatoes only from Fair Food Program farms.

They also agree to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes, money that goes directly to the farmworkers as a line-item bonus. In some cases, it doubles their paychecks.

Alejandrina Carrera appreciates the extra money, but is most grateful for the change in how she is treated on the job.

"You're not going to be harassed, you're not going to be insulted, you're not going to be forced to work. There's more respect now," she says.

Carrera came to Immokalee dreaming of a better life for herself. Today she dreams of a better life for her three children. They are all in school and she wants them to go on to college and have careers.

Her youngest kids are seven and nine. The oldest is 14, the same age she was when she first came to Florida.
__label__world Amsterdam (CNN) From its base in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, a confectionery company is doing its bit to fight modern-day slavery.

Its unconventional weapon of choice? A rich range of chocolate products.

"We are a funny company," says Henk Jan Beltman, chief chocolate officer at Tony's Chocolonely.

"The reason that we are a company is not that we want to sell chocolate and not that we want to make money." Instead, Beltman adds: "We want to make the world a nicer place."

Tony's Chocolonely is one of many companies dedicated to producing what's known as Fair Trade chocolate by providing better prices to farmers and slave free working conditions.

Each bar is marketed with a promise to the consumer that no slave labor was used in the making of its chocolate.

The cocoa sector, worth more than $100 billion per year, has long battled with poor labor practices and forms of exploitation.

A 2015 report from Tulane University and the U.S. Department of Labor found that more than two million children were working in what it defined as "hazardous" conditions in the cocoa industry in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

According to the World Fair Trade Organization, one of the 10 guiding principles of the Fair Trade movement is to ensure good working conditions and ensure no forced labor has been used in the manufacture of any product.

Yet Tony's Chocolonely believes the industry can further address this issue and that chocolate no longer needs to be a guilty pleasure.

Beltman says, "If you look at certification like the Rainforest Alliance or Fair Trade or UTZ, those are all good but they don't manufacture a product ... and as a product owner you feel responsibility and it's your responsibility to sell something you can be proud of.

"Whether it's fish or phones or chocolate bars, it's always the owner who is responsible for the stuff that they sell ... and a certification body is never going to take that responsibility away."

Art of the chocolatier

Its recipe for slave free chocolate starts on its cocoa farms.

By focusing on the fine details of its supply chain, Tony's Chocolonely says it traces the origin of the cocoa it buys -- all the way from the beans purchased directly from its farm cooperatives in West Africa to the finished product.

Yet it hasn't been working alone. Industry giant Barry Callebaut has become a strategic partner.

At its factory in the town of Wieze, Belgium, Barry Callebaut has built a system that isolates Tony's Chocolonely product.

Plant director, Xavier De Buysscher, says Tony's Chocolonely beans are treated, roasted and segregated. Its liquid chocolate is stored into a separate tank.

Once this process is complete, the product is molded by Belgian chocolate masters, Althea, which stamps an ethical message into each bar.

The unequal shape of the end product reflects inequality in the world and outlines the West African countries that supply the beans.

This detail is in keeping with the Tony's Chocolonely marketing strategy, to remind the consumer how and why the company began.

Life on the plantation

In 2003, Dutch journalists behind popular show "The Consumer Investigation Agency" exposed the trafficking of boys from Burkina Faso to the Ivory Coast, interviewing former slaves about life on the cocoa plantations.

The production team proposed to their audience that by eating chocolate all were complicit in slavery. After gathering testimonies from those who had been enslaved, reporter Teun Van De Keuken, unsuccessfully attempted to get himself arrested by the Dutch authorities to emphasize the point.

Three years later, determined to prove chocolate could be made slave-free, the journalists founded Tony's Chocolonely.

Now run by an executive team, the original founders have left the company. But cocoa labor abuses remain in the headlines.

The 2015 Tulane University report said the number of child laborers in cocoa production in Ghana and the Ivory Coast had increased by 13% from the time the last study had been conducted five years before.

It also cited endemic poverty as a major reason trafficking and unethical labor practices flourish in the region.

Taste of success

According to Beltman, Tony's Chocolonely operation has been hugely successful so far.

"We launched as a journalist initiative ... but all of a sudden by sending out the message people were buying the product and talking about [it]," Beltman says.

"We hit one million euro ($1.1 million) revenue in the first year. This year we aim to hit around $50 million in revenue."

Yet it's not just rising profitability that points to success at Tony's Chocolonely.

The fact that its methods have been fruitful is equally satisfying for all at the company.

"We only work with 7,000 farmers. We are a tiny company. But if we can do it then the big guys can do it as well," Beltman says. "Then we solve the problem of slavery in the value chain of cocoa."

"I'm gonna push as hard as we can to actually force other companies to work in the same way. There is no one in the world who wants to enjoy chocolate that comes from a source that's enslaved," he adds.
__label__world In 1964 Edward Mukuka Nkoloso, high school teacher and self-appointed director of Zambia's national space program, had the bold ambition of beating the USA and the Soviet Union in the space race, and landing a Zambian on the Moon.

Using unconventional techniques, such as spinning students around a tree in an oil drum, Nkoloso trained 12 astronauts. He was unsuccessful, but in 2014 there was a film released inspired by his efforts.

Fortunately Africa's space programs now look much more promising. In fact, in the last decade the continent has entered a space race.

An image of the International Space Station (ISS) is projected during the public viewing of deployment of Kenyas first cube satellite at the University of Nairobi in Nairobi.

Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Egypt and Algeria have taken a renewed interests in their existing programs, and Kenya has joined the club and launched its own home-designed satellite last week

Two big players

While no African country is within realistic reach of moon travel yet, Nigeria and South Africa have by far the most advanced space programs on the continent.

South Africa is set to host the world's biggest radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

If successful, they claim the telescope will enable astronomers to look much deeper into space -- at the sensitivity of many times current telescopes. The first phase will cost approximately $790 million.

"What drove this project was a need for the next generation radio telescope with a preference for the southern hemisphere as then you can view the centre of our galaxy," said Carla Sharpe, Business Manager at SKA.

"When you're studying space with an optical telescope you're only observing the visible light, whereas a radio telescope can observe the electromagnetic spectrum over a number of frequencies," she added.

However, Sharpe disagrees that there is an African space race per se. Instead, African countries see space programs as an important part of economic development.

"In general African countries accept that developing technology drives growth and that space is a great area for technology development. It's accepted as a new market we can still get into," Sharpe continues.

Although space programs in Africa are frequently criticized for being a waste of money, particularly with the presence of more immediate concerns.

Sharpe responded: "Space science and technology is not just rockets. It's everything from data analytics, data storage and transport and more. There are so many areas of development within the arena which are classed as space science."

Space exploration

South Africa has set its sights on space observation, but what about space travel?

In that field, Nigeria is leading the charge. They're planning to be the first African country to send an astronaut into space.

The government announced the plans last year, and is aiming to visit space by 2030.

Nigeria is aiming to create a world-class space industry. "The focus of our space program is economic development," Felix Ale, communications chief of The National Space Research and Development Agency (NASDRA), told CNN.

Since 2003, NASRDA have launched five satellites which have helped improve agricultural practices, collect climate data and track-down hostages taken by Boko Haram and in 2016 received $20 million of funding

But Professor Calestous Juma, an expert on space programs in developing countries at the Harvard Kennedy School, told CNN in 2016 that the mission could be a "lofty ambition" that "may or may not happen."

Africa's other space programs

Aside from Nigeria and South Africa, there are also a number of interesting developments from other African countries.

The Entoto Observatory and Research Center which is located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.

In 2017 Ethiopia announced it would launch a satellite into orbit within 3 to 5 years to help monitor weather conditions. And in 2015, the multi-million dollar Entoto Observatory and Research Center was opened near the capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Kenya has launched its first cube satellite this year, designed by experts at the University of Nairobi.

Ghana is also venturing into space technology and successfully sent its first satellite into orbit in 2017. In 2015, the government allocated $10m for nuclear and space technology.

To add to that, in 2016 Egypt approved ambitious plans to launch a new Egyptian Space Agency.

African countries working together

Across the continent new programs represent a growing appetite for space technology, but the continent still lags far behind in the global space race. It could be argued that a collaborative effort could help the continent catch up.

But there is no pan-African space program in the works just yet.

In 2010 the African Union (AU) approved a study to test the feasibility of an African Space Agency. Two years later President of Sudan Omar Hassan al-Bashir repeated the call

It largely fell on deaf ears.

"My personal opinion is that the African Space Policy is a great step forward. The African Space Agency will be beneficial in the long term but is a little premature. I think countries need to develop and grow their own capabilities first," said Sharpe.

An official African Space Agency might be a long way off, but national space programs are looking at ways of working together.

"I think collaboration will be the only the answer for us to develop forward," said Sharpe.
__label__world (CNN) For the 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, the Hajj is considered a spiritual pinnacle. Each year, up to three million pilgrims descend on Mecca -- the epicenter of the Muslim world -- to seek redemption, to forgive and to be forgiven.

Wrapped in white cloth, worshippers embark on the five-day pilgrimage, considered one of the five pillars of Islam. All Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to make the journey to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.

Mecca is meant to be the bedrock of Muslim unity, with the Hajj lauded as a place where pilgrims shed class, race, and nation. In his 1964 pilgrimage, less than a year before his assassination, black civil rights activist Malcolm X marveled at the "spirit of unity" between white and non-white Muslims -- he later disavowed many of his beliefs about racial separation on returning to the United States.

But as Saudi Arabia has taken a more muscular approach to foreign policy with the rise of a young Crown Prince, Mecca has emerged as a political fault-line. A diplomatic spat between Saudi Arabia and Canada over a human rights statement resulted in the closure of one of the main flights between Canada and the kingdom, reportedly complicating matters for hajjis , or Muslim pilgrims.

A bruising Saudi-led 2016 embargo on Qatar, and the dissolution of diplomatic ties with Iran in 2016 has also disrupted pilgrimages for nationals of those countries in recent years. In Yemen, the ongoing war between Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed forces has all but trapped millions of would-be Yemeni pilgrims.

Still, Mecca is brimming with over 1.5 million international pilgrims this year , according to Saudi officials. These are devout Muslims who tenaciously pursue the pilgrimage, enduring the inconveniences of an arduous journey and sidestepping hurdles put in place by a difficult political climate whose temperatures continue to climb, and ignoring a string of unbecoming stories about the Hajj, including stampedes, fires and sexual harassment.

They prefer instead to focus on spiritual nourishment that the Hajj promises to supply.

Entering Mecca

Many pilgrims converge on the city weeks before the start of the Hajj rituals.

Worshippers wear special white garments -- men wrap themselves in seamless, stitchless cloth, while women wear a simple white dress and headscarf. The clothing is said to symbolize human equality and unity before God.

Pilgrims begin the Hajj with a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure that Muslims believe the Prophet Abraham from the Old Testament constructed. It's the most sacred shrine of Islam.

The Prophet Muhammed made the first Islamic pilgrimage in the year 628 AD, when he set out to Mecca with 1,400 of his followers. Mecca is considered to be a city for all Muslims and only Muslims. Non-Muslims are denied entry at all times.

Because of the centrality of the holy sites to the Muslim world, the Saudi monarch's preferred title is "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques," referring to the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in nearby Medina.

Saudi authorities manage the entry and exit of pilgrims through strict visa applications and have a dedicated Hajj ministry, employing 40,000 workers. In the last 10 years, 24 million Hajj pilgrims have visited the city. Thousands of civil servants are deployed to the pilgrimage each year.

A global tent city

To go through the six steps of the Hajj, pilgrims walk in massive processions, shoulder-to-shoulder with Muslims from more than 80 different countries. Together they share meals, prayers and very close living quarters.

"Groups of West Africans in colorful garb, almost singing verses from the Quran. Old Chinese couples, groups of blonde Europeans and Americans; it felt as if we were watching the entire world walk past," wrote CNN's Schams Elwazer who covered the pilgrimage for CNN in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

Sermon on the summit

For the third major Hajj ritual, Muslims gather at Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Muhammed is believed to have delivered his last sermon.

Upwards of a million pilgrims sit on the mountain, blanketing the site in white, while umbrellas used to shield the worshippers from the sun provide flashes of color.

This is the climax of the pilgrimage. Muslims perform day-long prayers, incantations and recitations from the Quran. It is not uncommon to see worshippers shed tears as they reach this peak of spiritual cleansing. Saudi Arabia's top clerics traditionally lead a Hajj sermon on this site.

Gender and Hajj

Mecca is the only Islamic holy site where men and women all pray together and perform all the Hajj rites together. In most mosques, women and men are assigned separate areas for worship, and when one room is available, women are expected to pray behind the men.

Authorities only segregate men and women at the Hajj in terms of sleeping arrangements.

According to the Brookings Institute's study on Hajj pilgrims, hajjis report more positive views of women's abilities and a greater concern for their quality of life after performing the pilgrimage. They are also more likely to favor educating girls and encourage female labor participation.

Still, reports of sexual harassment have plagued the ritual of late. Earlier this year, five women told CNN about their experiences with sexual abuse at the pilgrimage. One British woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, said she had never been sexually assaulted before going to the Hajj, where her breast was forcefully, and painfully grabbed as she headed into the Grand Mosque.

"Talking about sexual assault is difficult enough and talking about it in connection with the Hajj, which is a pillar of Islam, is even harder because it is sacred," she said.

One unnamed Saudi official said the allegations were being taken seriously by authorities, although it is not immediately clear if the kingdom has taken extra steps against harassment at the pilgrimage this year.

Dress codes for women are strict and even a wisp of hair escaping from the required headscarf can prompt frowns, or worse, from the crowds.

Stoning the devil

During the "stoning of the devil," pilgrims lob rocks at three pillars, known as the "Jamarat," symbolizing the rejection of the devil's temptation.

The ritual marks the beginning of the four-day Eid al-Adha holiday, known to Muslims as the "big Eid."

Muslims celebrate the Adha -- the Arabic word for "sacrifice" -- by slaughtering sheep and distributing the meat to the poor.

This is also the most dangerous part of the pilgrimage. People stream back and forth between the pillars and the Kaaba, posing a major crowd control challenge for organizers. Many have been wounded or killed by stones thrown from further back within the crowd.

Two years ago, more than 700 people were killed and nearly 900 were injured in a stampede while performing this ritual.

Since then, Saudi authorities have spent millions of dollars renovating the area, making it multi-layered instead of a flat plain, and renovating the pillars.

Becoming a Hajji

After five days, the Hajj comes full circle and worshipers return to the Grand Mosque for their final prayers.

For pilgrims and Saudi civil servants alike, the end of Hajj is the time to return to family and celebrate the remainder of Eid al-Adha.

At home, the pilgrims are greeted with fanfare. Congratulations from neighbors pour in and their homes are usually decked out in festive lighting.

The Hajji now has a somewhat elevated social status. A person who has completed the pilgrimage can add the phrase al-Hajj or hajji (pilgrim) to their name.
__label__politics Those labels describe the three groups of seats in the House of Representatives that will likely determine control of the chamber in November's midterm election.

Virtually all analysts in both parties agree that the epicenter of vulnerability for the House Republican majority is in what could be called red pockets: These are the predominantly white-collar suburban seats the GOP still holds in big metropolitan areas that are otherwise solidly Democratic. Those include places such as Orange County, California; New Jersey; Miami; and suburbs outside of New York City, Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Minneapolis.

But even if Democrats make big gains in those districts, there aren't quite enough of them to provide the party with the net gain of 24 seats it needs to recapture the House. That means House Democrats would also need to make inroads into the two other large groups of vulnerable GOP seats.

One is what I call Romneyland: white-collar suburban seats in purple and even red states where Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, almost universally performed better than Donald Trump did in 2016.

The third are the "blue-collar blues": mostly blue-collar, non-urban seats in blue states, where Trump almost without exception improved on Romney's performance.

More distantly, the Democrats are also eyeing a few Republican-held blue-collar seats in purple and Republican-leaning states. But control of the House will likely turn on how the battle between the parties turns in the red pockets, Romneyland and the blue-collar blues.

The red pockets will likely be the most reliable source of gains for Democrats because they compound two sources of Republican vulnerability: They are white-collar districts in areas with large numbers of Democrats, who appear motivated to turn out at higher-than-usual levels next fall.

The big question is how far Democrats can reach into places where only one of those advantages is present: white-collar seats in traditionally Republican-leaning areas, or seats in Democratic states that are more rural and blue-collar.

This battlefield reflects the long-term trends that have seen Democrats demonstrate increasing strength up and down the ballot in diverse, heavily college-educated, major metropolitan areas -- even in Republican-leaning states. In parallel, Republicans have established dominant control over preponderantly white non-metro and blue-collar areas, even in otherwise Democratic-leaning states.

All of these trends have accelerated under Trump. Amid improving attitudes toward the Republican tax bill, several recent polls have shown a small but measurable uptick in President Trump's job approval rating and a narrowing into the mid-single digits of the previously double-digit advantage Democrats have held in the "generic" ballot test of preferences for 2018.

But even with those shifts, polls still consistently find a deeply polarized electorate. Trump and the GOP retain solid support among white men without college degrees, if slightly less than they attracted in 2016. But they are facing intense resistance from younger and non-white voters -- especially African-Americans -- and much lower numbers than usual among college-educated whites, especially, but not exclusively, women.

White women without a college education, whose support was critical to Trump's 2016 victory, loom as a wild card: Polls find they have cooled on him, but Democrats still face many obstacles with them.

These diverging demographic attitudes shape the geography of the 2018 battlefield.

Red pockets

The clearest opportunity for Democrats is the relatively few remaining Republican-held districts in blue metro areas with large populations of college-educated whites, and in many cases substantial minority and youth populations as well. These are places crowded with voters who tilt toward liberal positions on social issues and recoil from Trump's volatile persona, particularly the way he talks about race.

The renewed visibility of gun control issues after the horrific Parkland, Florida, massacre could provide Democrats another lever in these districts, since the Republicans in them have almost universally voted with the National Rifle Association to loosen gun regulations in recent years.

These "red pockets" include the four seats Republicans control in Orange County -- the districts held by Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher and the open seats that will be vacated by Darrell Issa and Ed Royce -- as well as their sole remaining seat in Los Angeles County, held by Steve Knight.

Others that fit this description include the seats in the western Chicago suburbs held by Republican Peter Roskam and in the eastern Denver suburbs held by Mike Coffman; the three suburban Philadelphia seats held by Ryan Costello, Mike Fitzpatrick and Pat Meehan (who has announced he will not seek re-election amid a sex scandal); the northern Virginia seat held by Barbara Comstock; two open seats in New Jersey as well as the one defended by Rep. Leonard Lance; Lee Zeldin's seat in eastern Long Island; the suburban Minneapolis seats now held by Jason Lewis and Erik Paulsen; the Seattle-area seat that Dave Reichert is leaving; as well as the Miami-area seat being vacated by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and the nearby seat held by Rep. Carlos Curbelo.

Though Romney carried many of these seats -- often narrowly -- in 2012, Hillary Clinton won all of those listed above in 2016 except for the seats held by Lewis and Fitzpatrick, which Trump won by eyelash margins, and Zeldin's, which Trump won more comfortably. These resemble the places where Democrats showed the most dramatic gains in 2017, for instance in their sweep of legislative seats and the huge margins they generated in the governor's race in northern Virginia.

Compounding the GOP's vulnerability, the new congressional map the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued Monday, after earlier ruling that the current district lines represented an impermissible gerrymander, strengthened the Democrats' hand in all three suburban Philadelphia seats.

For Republicans, the key in these booming districts will be whether the good economy helps them recapture voters recoiling from Trump's personal behavior. One complication is these blue-state upper-middle-class suburbs are among the most likely losers from the GOP tax plan, which limits the deductibility of mortgage interest and state and local taxes. Democrats are highly unlikely to win back the House without maximizing their gains in the red pockets.

Romneyland

The next bucket of seats is demographically similar to the red pockets but politically distinct because they are in metro areas that lean much more reliably toward the GOP.

I call this group of seats Romneyland because they are filled with voters who resemble Romney demographically and ideologically: professionals and corporate middle managers who want a president who will shrink government and even pursue a center-right social agenda, but also exude professionalism and decorum.

Romney won virtually every seat in this category in 2012. In 2016, Trump lost ground relative to Romney in almost all of them, though the residual Republican strength was great enough that he still carried many, albeit often narrowly.

The districts in this bucket include the Omaha-area seat held by Don Bacon; the seats in suburban Houston and outside Dallas held by John Culberson and Pete Sessions, respectively; the two suburban Atlanta seats held by Karen Handel and Rob Woodall; David Young's seat outside Des Moines; the Tucson-area seat Martha McSally is vacating to run for the Senate from Arizona; the Lexington, Kentucky-area seat held by Andy Barr; the seats outside Detroit that Dave Trott is vacating and Mike Bishop is defending; and Kevin Yoder's seat in suburban Kansas City, Kansas.

These seats are not immune from the forces threatening the Republicans in the red pockets: Handel, for instance, only narrowly survived last June's special election in Georgia, though her predecessor Tom Price had carried over 60% of the vote there as recently as 2016.

But as Handel's slim victory over Democrat Jon Ossoff showed, Republicans have more of a cushion in these places than in the red pockets. That's partly because more of the white-collar whites in them are social conservatives than their counterparts in the Democratic-leaning metro areas.

Blue-collar blues

The third key test for Democrats is the districts I call "blue-collar blues." These are the blue-collar, exurban, small town and rural seats in states that generally lean Democratic.

These include Republican seats held by John Faso, John Katko and Claudia Tenney in upstate New York; Mike Bost, Rodney Davis and Randy Hultgren in downstate Illinois; the northeast Iowa seat of Rod Blum; Bruce Poliquin's northern Maine district; and the Central Valley, California, seats of Jeff Denham and David Valadao.

JUST WATCHED Dems flip deep-red Missouri state House seat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dems flip deep-red Missouri state House seat 01:53

These seats present an especially revealing test for Democrats. Former President Barack Obama carried almost all of them at least once and many of them have elected Democratic House members in the recent past. But House Democrats were routed in these places in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections under Obama, and almost all of these districts turned further toward Trump in 2016.

The 2017 results in Virginia and Alabama showed Democrats almost completely failing to crack the GOP's hold on blue-collar and rural voters. But some Democrats argue that terrain is much tougher for the party in the South than in the Northeastern and Midwestern states where these competitive House seats are concentrated.

Democrats see an opening in polling, such as the 2017 average of Gallup's daily approval ratings for Trump, that shows a significant erosion in his support across the Rust Belt among working-class white women, even as he remains very strong among blue-collar white men. Converting that female disillusionment with Trump into votes for Democratic congressional candidates is likely the key to seriously contesting the "blue-collar blue" seats.

One early test will be March's special election in the heavily blue-collar southwestern Pennsylvania district that Republican Rep. Tim Murphy has vacated: Democrat Conor Lamb, a former Marine, is running competitively against Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone in a district Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points.

Beyond the top-tier targets in the red pockets, there's a spirited behind-the-scenes debate among Democratic strategists about which of the remaining two buckets of seats represents the party's best opportunity in 2018.

Some focus most on winning back working-class voters in blue states, who have a recent history of voting for the party but are more favorable to Trump. Others see more opportunity to convert white-collar suburbanites in red states, who have a longer history of voting Republican but are also more disaffected from the President.

To recapture the House, Democrats will likely need to do a considerable amount of both.

The Sunshine State contest is likely to be one of the most expensive in the country this year, making Scott's net worth of nearly $150 million an added benefit of his candidacy for Republicans. The Republican governor has shown a willingness to dip into his personal funds in previous races.

If Democrats are to have any hope of reclaiming the Senate majority they will need to hold onto Florida -- and most, if not all, of the other nine states with Democratic incumbents that Trump won in 2016. Republicans currently hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate, meaning Democrats need a net gain of two seats.

Nelson, who is seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate, started the calendar year with $8 million in the bank. He won his most recent race in 2012 by 13 points over Republican Connie Mack IV while at the same time Barack Obama carried the state by just a single point over Mitt Romney.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan's bombshell announcement that he will not seek re-election brings with it immediate and long-term political ramifications for his southeast Wisconsin district and the House landscape overall, where Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to gain the majority in 2019.

The most acute effect will be felt in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which Ryan has represented since 1999. He already was facing a potential challenge from Democrat Randy Bryce, who had raised nearly $5 million for his campaign, including $2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The district, which includes Kenosha and Ryan's hometown of Janesville, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the southwest Pennsylvania district Conor Lamb won in the March special election.

The Republican-aligned candidate in the recent Supreme Court race in Wisconsin won this district by five percentage points, despite losing the statewide race by more than 11 points.

That GOP performance is on par with Mitt Romney's margin in the district in 2012, but less than Donald Trump's 10-point spread there in 2016.

Bryce's bid is likely to lose a little enthusiasm without Ryan's name on the ballot, but the energy this cycle is clearly on the Democratic side.

More broadly, Republicans are also losing the party's best fundraiser for House candidates. Just this Monday, Ryan's campaign announced hauling in more than $11 million in the first quarter of the year, bringing its total raised to $54 million -- and transferring more than $40 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee to help other GOP candidates this cycle.

Then there are the optics of the decision. By announcing his retirement now, it sends a dire signal to Republicans that an already tough environment could get even more challenging.

Ryan's open seat moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican, with the potential to become more competitive depending on who the GOP nominates to run in this district.

At the same time we are making a few other changes to our House race ratings.

Arizona

AZ-08: We are soon going to get yet another peek into the 2018 political landscape with an upcoming special election where Republicans are hoping the natural DNA of the district will be somewhat more resistant to the Democratic enthusiasm that toppled their candidates in Pennsylvania and Alabama.

The April 24 contest in Arizona's 8th Congressional District features Republican Debbie Lesko, a former state senator, and Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room physician. The seat was vacated in December when GOP Rep. Trent Franks resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.

Democrats did not contest this House seat in 2016 or 2014.

At the presidential level, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 21 points in the district, which is made up primarily of the western Phoenix suburbs and chock full of retirees. Romney bested Barack Obama there by 25 points in 2012.

On the heels of Lamb's victory last month, Republicans aren't taking any chances. They've poured more than $600,000 into the race to keep it from flipping to the Democrats.

Democrats aren't nearly as bullish on this special election as they were about Pennsylvania. Republicans hold a 17-point advantage in voter registration in the district. Lesko remains a heavy favorite, but given how Democrats have overperformed in special elections the past year, this race should be closer than most would normally expect.

This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Ohio

OH-12: After the Arizona special election, all eyes will turn to this central Ohio district, which became open when Republican Pat Tiberi resigned in January to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable. The district is more urban than PA-18, which should make it a bit bluer. The inner ring Columbus suburbs are the kinds of places where Democrats expect to make gains this cycle. It's slightly less white than PA-18, and also a bit younger and with more college graduates. Trump got 52% of the vote here in 2012, underperforming Romney's 54% mark. There are crowded primaries on both sides, but the makeup of the district and the Democratic edge in enthusiasm mean this one is likely to get more competitive before August. This race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Florida

FL-15: Ryan's isn't the only retirement announcement from Republicans Wednesday. Four-term Rep. Dennis Ross is leaving as well, opening up a seat in a district that includes the Tampa Suburbs -- and has the same partisan tilt on the presidential level as Ryan's district. There is a crowded Democratic primary there, with 31-year-old Navy veteran Andrew Learned holding a slight fundraising edge at this point. With Ross no longer on the ballot, this seat appears primed to become more competitive. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

New York

NY-11: Max Rose, a former non-profit healthcare executive and Army veteran, gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in this district, home to Staten Island. Rose also stands to benefit from a fractured Republican primary, with incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan running against former Rep. Michael Grimm, who served time in prison for felony tax fraud. For his part, Donovan is facing allegations he used his position to intervene in the arrest of his domestic partner's son on charges of heroin possession. This race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Ohio

OH-14: Democrat Betsy Rader doesn't have a primary, giving her a clear shot at challenging GOP Rep. Dave Joyce in the 14th, home to the Cleveland and Akron suburbs. Like OH-12, this district has been more favorable to Democrats in previous elections than PA-18. Trump won it by 11 points in 2016, but Romney carried it by only three points in 2012. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Wisconsin

WI-07: GOP Rep. Sean Duffy looks well-positioned to win re-election in northern Wisconsin, with more than $2 million in the bank at last check. But the recent state Supreme Court election in the Badger State suggests it might not be a sure thing, with a 20-point swing in favor of the Democrats from Trump's margin in 2016. Democrats think Bon Iver manager Kyle Frenette could give them a shot here. Frenette recently announced raising $250,000 in the six weeks since his campaign launched. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.
__label__world Cochabamba, Bolivia (CNN) Brisa De Angulo grew up in Bolivia and remembers having a wonderful childhood. That is, until she was 15.

That's when she suffered repeated sexual abuse by an adult in her extended family.

His threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.

When she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.

"There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn't stay silent," said De Angulo, now 30. "I found out that I wasn't alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something."

Of the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women -- with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.

In 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established Fundación Una Brisa de Esperanza -- or A Breeze of Hope Foundation . At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

"We work with the families...to see (the) child as a very powerful survivor, and to have the support that she needs so that she can take her case to court, and she can heal," De Angulo said.

The organization also advocates for legal reforms and policy changes for the rights of abuse survivors in Bolivia.

"I had to use the rest of my life to prevent other girls from going through what I went through," said De Angulo, whose extensive team has assisted about 1,500 young survivors.

CNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.

CNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you're working to combat?

Brisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it's a boy, then you're in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you're a girl, then you're this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.

We need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.

We also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people -- people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.

CNN: Your experiences inspired you to pursue your law degree. What impact has your organization's legal efforts had?

De Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn't want to take my case.

When we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we've taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.

When I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn't a lawyer, it wasn't the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we've proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.

Another law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn't take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.

CNN: The country now has an annual Walk Against Sexual Violence. How did that come about?

De Angulo: August 9 was one of the hardest days of my life because it was the day I had to go to court and face my aggressor. I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.

(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.

It's beautiful because sometimes you are walking in the street and you see someone with a blue ribbon and you just look at their eyes and you know that we're in this together. And you don't have to say any words, but you know that you're not alone.

__label__politics (CNN) The battle between the parties for control of the closely divided US Senate has become a contest between the exception and the rule.

The rule is that over the past quarter century, it has grown much more difficult for even the most talented Senate candidates to win in states that usually vote for the other party in presidential races. That trend, which is affecting both parties, has created a very narrow balance of power in the Senate -- and triggered frequent changes of partisan control -- because each side has established a natural advantage at the presidential level in about half the states.

The paradox is that because the balance of power between the two parties is so precarious, the Senate majority now often tips based on the few exceptions to this pattern -- the candidates who find ways to win, in effect, behind enemy lines in states that usually back the other party's presidential nominees.

This year, that test will fall primarily on the five Democratic senators seeking reelection in states that have invariably voted Republican for president in recent years. Five other Democrats are trying to hold seats in states that have been more evenly balanced between the parties, but which tipped to Donald Trump in 2016. By contrast, Dean Heller of Nevada is the only Republican this year defending a Senate seat in a state that Democrats have won in any of the past three presidential elections.

Democrats have an outside chance of regaining the majority in November if they can win in Arizona and Tennessee, states that have leaned reliably Republican in recent presidential elections, but which may be offering new opportunities for the party amid the backlash to Trump among suburban voters and minorities alike. But given how many seats in red-leaning terrain Democrats must defend, the more achievable goal for them this year may be to avoid losses that put the Senate out of reach in 2020 when they will have more pick-up opportunities in states that lean their way in presidential races (Colorado and Maine), are already presidential battlegrounds (North Carolina and Iowa), or may be evolving in that direction (Georgia).

The increasing alignment of states' presidential and Senate preferences reflects the broader decline in split-ticket voting over the past several decades. At its height in the 1970s, about one out of four voters typically voted for one party in the presidential election and the other party in Senate races, according to an analysis by Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz.

US politics is more and more tribal

But the increasingly partisan, even tribal, nature of modern politics has made split-ticket voting much more rare. More voters have started to treat both Senate and House races as quasi-parliamentary elections, viewing them less as a referendum on the merits of the individual candidates than as a choice on which party they prefer to control the chamber. The result, as I have written, is that for congressional candidates, the name on the back of a candidate's jersey now usually matters less than the color on the front of it.

That trend becomes vividly apparent when looking at Senate results through the lens of how states have recently voted for president.

One place to start is 1992, when Bill Clinton's first election shattered the GOP's dominance of the White House over the previous quarter century, and coalesced a new partisan alignment in which Democrats have carried the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential contests (though they have won the Electoral College, and thus the White House, just four times.)

Over those seven elections starting with 1992, 24 states have voted Democratic at least four times. Democrats now hold 40 of their 48 Senate seats, or 83.3%. Over those seven presidential elections, 26 states have voted Republican at least four times. Republicans hold 43 of their 52 Senate seats, a virtually identical 82.6%.

It may be somewhat outdated to characterize states based on their preferences since 1992, however, since Clinton managed to hold a number of blue-collar Southern and border states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee. Each of those states has grown more reliably Republican since, as the GOP has deepened its hold on older, non-college educated, evangelical and rural white voters. Meanwhile, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada have migrated more reliably into the Democratic camp in presidential contests, amid growing racial diversity and declining Republican strength among well-educated whites.

Democrats have more momentum, Republicans have a much better the map

Comparing the party's Senate results to the presidential outcomes over the past three presidential elections may offer a more revealing map of the opportunities and challenges ahead for the parties.

Measured against that yardstick, the relationship between presidential and Senate preferences remains very powerful. In the three presidential elections starting with 2008, 20 states have voted Democratic all three times: Democrats now hold 37 of their 40 Senate seats. The only Republicans left in these states are Heller, who faces a tough reelection battle this fall, as well as Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, who will both face reelection in 2020.

Six more states voted twice for Barack Obama but then flipped to Trump in 2016. The parties now evenly divide those states' Senate seats, holding six each. But Democrats in November will be defending five of their six seats in this category. In descending order of vulnerability, they include Bill Nelson in Florida and Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, followed by Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania and Debbie Stabenow in Michigan. Republicans are not defending any of the seats they hold in these states.

This is partially a matter of timing. Senators serve for six years in a term and Democrats are defending, for the second time, a number of the seats they won in 2006, when they took control of the Senate from Republicans. They lost control in 2014, when Republicans beat several Democrats who had been swept to victory during Barack Obama's resounding win in 2008. Republicans will defend their 2014 gains in 2020.

Moving to the Republican side of the line, Indiana and North Carolina voted for Obama in 2008 but have backed the GOP candidate in the two elections since.

Republicans already hold three of their four Senate seats and Democrats this fall will be defending their sole beachhead in this group: Joe Donnelly in Indiana.

The main event in November's Senate election will unfold in the 22 states that have voted Republican in each of the past three presidential races. Republicans already hold 39 of those states' 44 Senate seats (almost 89%, or just slightly below the Democratic share in the 20 states they have carried three straight times).

But Democrats this year must defend four of their five seats in this group. In descending order of vulnerability they include Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Jon Tester in Montana. The twist is that even as Republicans press those opportunities, they must defend Senate seats in at least three other states they have won each time since 2008: Democrats are mounting strong challenges for open Senate seats in Arizona and Tennessee and have found a dynamic, though still long-shot challenger, in Beto O'Rourke in Texas.

Even Mississippi might become a long-shot target for Democrats if Tea Party insurgent Chris McDaniel wins a primary later this year against Cindy Hyde-Smith, the more mainstream Republican that Gov. Phil Bryant recently appointed to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thad Cochran.

The long-term trajectory in these numbers is toward an unmistakable alignment between the way states vote in presidential and Senate elections. Yet because the parties hold a presidential edge in about the same number of states -- with perhaps just slightly more leaning toward Republicans at this point -- it's the small deviations from the overall trend that may decide Senate control in the years ahead.

How to become the exception to the rule

Three factors seem most important in shaping those exceptions and determining which side controls the upper chamber.

One factor is which side wins what are often very close races in the remaining battleground states where neither side has established a consistent advantage at the presidential level. (I define those as the states that have voted two of the past three for either party, with the exception of Indiana, whose 2008 vote for Obama looks more like an anomaly over time.). Democrats missed a golden opportunity in 2016 to strengthen their hands in these battlegrounds when they failed to beat any of five Republican incumbents in Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Florida -- partly because of Hillary Clinton's weakness, especially among blue-collar white voters, in those states. This year, Republicans face a comparable test against the five Democratic incumbents in the states that switched from Obama to Trump.

The second key factor in shaping exceptions is candidates who can either slow or advance the clock in their state's political evolution. The candidates who have stopped the clock are Democrats like Manchin, Heitkamp, and McCaskill, and Republicans such as Collins, who are holding on in states that have long since tilted to the other side in presidential races. None are guaranteed success in their next election, but it's hard to imagine anyone else from their party holding their seats in the near future after they have left the Senate.

Those who advance the clock are candidates who can establish an advance beachhead in states whose loyalties may be shifting at the presidential level. Kyrsten Sinema will try to do that for Democrats in Arizona this year, and the party is likely to make a serious run in 2020 at Republican David Perdue in Georgia. Conversely, it's easy to imagine Republicans making a big push in 2020 for a Senate seat in Minnesota, whose heavily blue-collar demographics will encourage Trump to vigorously contest it, though no Republican presidential nominee has won there since Ronald Reagan in 1980.

Finally, timing matters. Incumbent senators from the party out of the White House have rarely lost in midterm elections since the 1990s. Abramowitz notes that in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 midterms, the only incumbent senators who lost were from the president's party.

"If we were heading toward this midterm with Hillary Clinton in the White House most likely Democrats would be looking at losing several of those (red state) seats," he says. "The thing that is helping them out a lot is it's a midterm with an unpopular Republican president in the White House."

In states that Democrats are defending such as West Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, Trump is more popular than he is nationally. But he may not be quite as strong even there as he was in 2016. And that small shift may be just enough to allow some of the red state Democrats to defy the mounting odds for senators trying to survive behind enemy lines.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The first big primary night of 2018 is in the books.

It was tough going for some Republican House members looking for a promotion. But it also might cause a little heartburn for Republicans who are hoping to return to the chamber, or join it for the first time.

Based on Tuesday's results, CNN is moving four races to a more competitive ranking -- all in favor of the Democrats. In three of those contests, Republicans remain strong favorites to hold the seat, but Democrats landed candidates they feel are good fits for the districts. That also is true in the fourth race on the list, which moves to the Toss-Up column. Of the 22 races now rated as Toss-Ups, 20 are currently held by Republicans.

As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House.

NC-09: GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger became the first incumbent to lose a renomination contest this cycle, creating an open seat opportunity for Democrats where the party had already landed a strong challenger. Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine Corps veteran and clean energy entrepreneur, received nearly 38,000 votes Tuesday -- roughly 4,000 more than Pittenger and GOP primary winner Mark Harris combined. McCready heads into the general election with $1.2 million in the bank compared to about $70,000 for Harris, a former pastor. This district went for Donald Trump by 12 points in 2016, but Democrats hold a clear edge in enthusiasm at this stage of the race. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.

__label__politics In an interview with the Boston Globe on Tuesday, the California Democrat, who has led her party in the House for the last 15 years, said of the 2018 midterm election and her future: "We will win. I will run for speaker. I feel confident about it. And my members do, too."

That announcement was greeted with a mixture of joy and disappointment within the Democratic Party. Republicans, on the other hand, were positively gleeful at the prospect of having the unpopular Pelosi to run against this November -- and maybe more Novembers to come.

That reaction typifies the double-edged sword that Pelosi has become for Democrats. She is, without question, the party's best fundraiser and a hero among liberals in and out of Congress. Given those twin strengths, it is virtually impossible for Pelosi to be beaten in an intraparty vote.

At the same time, Pelosi -- thanks to years of sustained attacks from Republicans -- is an unpopular figure in many key districts Democrats need to win the majority this fall. In an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll in March, just 21% had a positive view of Pelosi as compared to 43% who saw her in a negative light.

In recent years, as Democrats have failed to recapture the majority they lost in 2010, more and more rank-and-file Democrats have broken away from Pelosi -- calling for younger (and just plain different) leadership (Pelosi is 78 years old).

In the leadership vote following the 2016 election, nearly one third of the Democratic caucus voted for someone other than Pelosi -- the most opposition she has ever faced. At the same time, the fact that it was a story that Pelosi only won with two-thirds of her caucus speaks to how strong her standing among her peers remains.

"It's always easy to say you want a change in leadership," former New York Rep. Steve Israel told me. "But change requires forethought. Who can raise the hundreds of millions that she can? Who can keep the caucus together as she has? Who can secure the legislative victories she's secured? Sometimes, you don't know what you got until they're gone."

There is no question that Pelosi's fundraising ability cannot be immediately replaced -- and that Democrats might struggle for years to replace it. Pelosi raised more than $16 million in the first three months of 2018, with the vast majority of that total -- $15.4 million -- going directly to the party's campaign arm. Pelosi's office puts her total fundraising since she became a member of the Democratic leadership in 2002 at just south of $660 million. That's a staggering sum for any elected official.

And, the Democratic bench to replace Pelosi is very, very thin. Aside from New York Rep. Joe Crowley, who has been waiting in the wings for years and is increasingly open about his ambitions , there simply are not a large chunk of potential Pelosi successors.

Much of that has to do with Pelosi's longevity. People like Steny Hoyer of Maryland or Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the second and third ranking Democrats in the House, are simply too old to offer themselves as fresh faces in a post-Pelosi era (Hoyer is also 78 years old; Clyburn is 77). Other rising stars within the party -- Israel, Xavier Becerra of California, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida -- have either moved up to the Senate, left Washington for other politics jobs, retired or seen their careers blow up.

All of that makes for a major leadership vacuum if and when Pelosi leaves. She knows that. And she also knows that there is just no math in the Democratic caucus by which she doesn't secure a majority of the votes -- no matter what happens on election day 2018.

The truth is -- and this has been a fact for quite some time now -- there is no one who would stand a chance against her in a leadership election. That reality doesn't preclude the fact that she is increasingly an anchor around the necks of candidates running in politically marginal areas. But, for all of the chatter from Democratic candidates and elected officials about how it's time for Pelosi to go, all of them will admit they can't make it happen.

Pelosi is here to stay. For as long as she wants.
__label__politics (CNN) It's become a numbing Washington ritual. Donald Trump shatters a traditional boundary on the exercise of presidential power. Or he uses inflammatory language that stirs racial animosities. Or he's hit by new revelations in the overlapping investigations into his campaign's contacts with foreign governments in 2016 and his own tangled financial and personal affairs before the presidency.

As each of these bombshells detonate, sometimes within hours of each other, congressional Republican leaders then react with little more than a shrug. Even more important, the vast majority of the Republican electoral coalition increasingly responds the same way.

All of these dynamics played out multiple times this past week. Trump shattered boundaries by openly demanding the Department of Justice investigate the ongoing special counsel examination of his campaign and by privately pressuring the US Postal Service to raise rates on Amazon , whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, which Trump considers an enemy. He used George Wallace-like language in describing members of the MS-13 gang as "animals." And he faced the startling revelation that during the 2016 campaign his son Donald Trump Jr., who had earlier convened with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton, also met with emissaries of Middle Eastern governments offering to help in the election.

After all that, Republicans responded this week with the sort of silence usually expected from the crowd at the 18th hole of a golf tournament.

The Trump paradox

The elimination of any distance between Trump and the conventional Republican interests that controlled the party before him has happened so incrementally it can be difficult to discern from day to day. But it remains one of the central political dynamics of 2018. Over the long term, Trump's success at stamping his polarizing brand on the GOP remains a huge electoral gamble for the party because it risks alienating the young, well-educated and diverse groups growing, rather than shrinking, in the electorate.

But in the near-term, the GOP's choice to ally so unequivocally with such a unique president may have the paradoxical effect of producing a much more conventional midterm election than seemed possible earlier this year. And that means for Democrats to secure the gains they seek in November, they will need to overcome the typical challenges they face in a midterm election far more than they expected even only a few months ago.

In both 2010 and 2014, the two midterm elections under Barack Obama, Democrats suffered huge losses. Each time the party faced similar problems. The biggest was a collapse in turnout among young voters, and a smaller, but still significant, decline among minorities. In both 2010 and 2014, the share of the vote cast by young adults 18-29, a strongly Democratic-leaning group, was fully six percentage points lower than in the presidential race just two years earlier, according to exit polls.

Each time, the non-white share of the vote dropped three points compared to the previous presidential contest. In turn, seniors, who now lean strongly toward the GOP, represented a significantly greater share of the vote in each midterm than in the previous presidential race.

Those turnout problems for Democrats were compounded by anemic performances among white men and women without a college degree, and white men with degrees. In both 2010 and 2014, according to exit polls, Democratic congressional candidates carried no more than 36% of voters in each of those groups. The party's performance among college-educated white women was better (43% in 2010 and 47% in 2014) but still below their strongest showings with those women in recent years.

Through much of 2017, it appeared possible that Trump's general weakness might solve all of these traditional Democratic problems -- or at least render them inconsequential.

Especially during the extended Republican struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump's presidency sometimes seemed at risk of functional collapse under the combined pressure of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian election meddling investigation, internal administrative chaos and incompetence, chronic divisions between the White House and congressional Republicans and the president's inability or unwillingness to control a belligerent and volatile temperament.

It's still possible any of those factors -- or some combination of them -- could politically debilitate Trump or, much less likely, even force him for office. But it no longer seems plausible that he will simply implode.

Rather over the past several months -- particularly since the passage of the GOP tax plan late last year -- Trump has shown clear signs of consolidating more of the usual Republican institutional and electoral base than he had earlier, despite all the norm-breaking excesses of his presidency. His approval rating in most polls has moved up from the high thirties to the low forties. That's still weaker than it should be given the robust economy, but a clear sign that he has recaptured many traditionally center-right voters. Over that same period, the tightening generic ballot test measuring preferences for the 2018 election show much of that same support drifting back, like metal filings toward a magnet, around congressional Republicans.

That doesn't mean Democrats can't retake the House or conceivably even the Senate in 2018 or beat Trump in 2020. But it does mean they can't rely on Republican disarray to power those victories. Despite all of Trump's unique liabilities, the key institutions and voter blocks of red America show every sign of mobilizing to maintain their control of power in Washington.

Support for Trump in key groups

Since he took office, Trump's approval rating has always been high among self-identified Republicans and core Republican groups. The most recent national polls from CNN and the Pew Research Center , for instance, both put his approval rating among white men without a college degree at a robust 66%. More than three-fifths of those men also said they intend to support Republican candidates for Congress this fall.

Even more telling may be the preferences the polls recorded among two groups of generally Republican-leaning white voters who Democrats have hoped would abandon the GOP under Trump: white men with a college degree, and white women without one. The two polls vary slightly in their measurement of how those voters view Trump himself: in the CNN poll, both groups give him an approval rating around 50%, while in the Pew Survey, he draws about 45% approval from both.

Yet both surveys show that Republicans now hold a solid lead with both groups in their preferences for the midterm election. Both surveys show Republicans now drawing over 50% of college-educated white men, while among blue-collar women Pew puts the GOP slightly above 50% and CNN shows them just slightly below. In each survey, Democrats are winning only about two-fifths of both groups. Those advantages aren't as lopsided as Republicans enjoyed in 2010 or 2014, but if they endure, they may be sufficient to blunt the Democrats' gains in 2018.

A shift to Democrats by college-educated women

The clearest improvement for Democrats from 2010 and 2014 is that both polls show Trump facing disapproval from about two-thirds of college-educated white women. Almost exactly three-fifths of those women in each survey say they plan to vote Democratic in November. That's significantly more than Democrats have won among that group in any congressional election since 1992, according to exit polls, and that shift alone could allow them to capture several seats Republicans hold in white-collar suburbs. The 2017 elections also have demonstrated a high level of engagement among African-American voters, especially women-and they register passionate distaste for Trump in polls.

But if those are the only ways the electorate in 2018 differs from 2010 and 2014, Democrats would likely be disappointed in the results. The party is betting on greater engagement from its core voters than among Republicans, but a succession of Trump policy decisions aimed at energizing the GOP base (such as hardline approaches to immigration) may be narrowing that gap: the CNN survey showed only a modest six percentage point gap between the share of Republican and Democratic-leaning voters who said they were very enthusiastic about voting.

And while recent reports show voter registration rising among younger voters in some key states, the proportion of younger adults who say they are closely following news about the election was far lower than for any other age group in the Pew poll. That's despite the deep opposition to Trump that they register in all surveys.

The headwinds facing Republicans in November remain formidable: the last three times one party went into a midterm election with unified control of government (the Democrats in 1994 and 2010 and the Republicans in 2006) voters revoked it. Trump's approval rating after his recent gains is higher than George W. Bush's was at the time of the 2006 Republican loss, but still lower than Obama or Bill Clinton during their midterm defeats. And while polls show mixed evidence of a Democratic turnout advantage in November, in practice, party voters have stampeded to the polls in the actual elections held since Trump took office. Fundraising for Democrats is astronomical as well.

But compared to six months ago, the constant gales swirling around Trump no longer look as certain to blow away all of the GOP's traditional midterm advantages. Nor does it appear likely that any new revelation in the various investigations of Trump will dissolve support for him or the GOP Congress. As in earlier midterm elections, mobilizing young people still looks like a challenge for Democrats, as does persuading more blue-collar white women and white-collar white men.

In other words, even with all of the turmoil around Trump, there is no cavalry coming to rescue blue America from Republican dominance of Washington. Democrats will need to storm those gates themselves, beginning with finding ways to overcome the resurfacing obstacles that have hurt them so badly in midterm elections before.
__label__politics (CNN) Congressional Republicans spend most of their time these days holding their breath and praying that President Donald Trump doesn't say something that will blow up their carefully laid plans for the 2018 election.

Of course, this is Donald Trump we are talking about. And blowing up carefully laid plans is, well, sort of his thing.

Which brings me to Trump's speech at the annual Susan B. Anthony dinner in Washington Tuesday night . Here's part of what Trump said when talking about the coming midterm election:

"But if Democrats gain power, they will try to reverse these incredible gains. These are historic gains. They will try and reverse many of them. So your vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016 -- although I'm not sure I really believe that, but you know. (Laughter.) I don't know who the hell wrote that line. I'm not sure. (Laughter and applause.) But it's still important."

HA HA HA HA HA ... wait.

This is vintage Trump. He is reading a prepared speech about how 2018 is so critical because it will determine whether the gains made for conservatives with his 2016 election will be continued in the second half of his first term or not. It's standard issue political speak for a president trying to rally his somewhat too-satisfied base to the necessity of turning out to vote in midterm contests.

Since there have been midterm elections, presidents have given speeches in the run-up to the campaign trying make sure their bases understand just how high the stakes actually are for this non-presidential year vote.

JUST WATCHED These are the highlights of Trump's Twitter habit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These are the highlights of Trump's Twitter habit 02:03

But this is Trump. And Trump never does things the way past presidents (or even past politicians) have. So he reads the line -- "your vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016" -- but them stops himself because, well, he doesn't totally believe it.

Trump believes that the most important election -- past, present or future -- was his election in 2016. It was the biggest upset in American political history. It was a seminal moment in the ongoing battle between the people and the powerful. It signaled a remaking of not just the Republican party but of how we conceive of -- and analyze -- American politics.

(Nota bene: I think he's right about all of that.)

In truth, that doesn't make Trump terribly unique. Every president thinks his election -- especially the first one -- is the most important election. And that the second most important election is their reelection race. The difference? They don't say it out loud.

Trump's honesty is sure to send a chill down the spines of Republican strategists tasked with trying to hold onto the GOP's 23-seat majority come this fall.

For Republicans to have any chance at remaining the majority party in 2019, they badly need the Trump base that turned out in droves to vote for the GOP nominee in 2016 to again head to the polls in five months' time.

The available data since that 2016 election suggests that isn't easy -- even with an engaged Trump. In Alabama, Trump was an active participant in the final days of the special election between Roy Moore and Doug Jones. But he was unable to sway the result to Moore. Ditto a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania in which Trump campaigned with the Republican nominee, only to watch him come up short with voters.

What Republicans simply cannot have is a Trump who seems less than jazzed about the 2018 midterms -- and who conveys that "meh" feeling to his core base of supporters. Which is why Trump's comments on Tuesday night have to be so concerning for Republicans.

Let's be clear: There was a joke-y element to Trump's aside. People laughed -- twice! -- during his 2018-is-no-2016 lines.

But, in all "jokes" there is an element of truth. Especially when the joker is Donald Trump.

He often hides behind humor to tell truths he quite clearly believes. Or uses the idea that he was joking to escape criticism or controversy

The question Republican candidates and elected officials have to ask themselves this morning is, do they trust that Trump was joking? And, even more importantly: Does Trump's base know that he was joking? And will he make that clear a whole bunch of times between now and the November election? Can anyone make him?

Even the slightest loss of enthusiasm among Trump base voters could be problematic for the broader Republican Party. Special election results over the past 17 months have confirmed time and again what polls of the electorate also show: That the Democratic base is currently more passionate and motivated to turn out than the Republican one.

Trump's role over the next five months is to use his personal popularity among Republican base voters to close that gap. But comments like the one he made Tuesday night could well have the opposite effect.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) For years, comedian Billy Eichner has been known for screaming at people about pop culture on the streets of New York for his show "Billy on the Street."

Now, he wants to yell at people about something else: politics.

"I've been shouting about silly things -- actors, Oscars, thing I've always cared about," he told CNN in a recent interview. "But I want to use my voice to shout at people about more significant things."

Enter Funny or Die -- Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's 11-year-old comedy website that is home to viral videos including Zach Galifianakis' show "Between Two Ferns" (which famously had former President Barack Obama on as a guest in 2014). Eichner has a history with the digital comedy brand, which helped launch "Billy on the Street" and subsequently elevated his career.

So it came as no surprise in February of this year when the website announced it is partnering with Eichner yet again. This time for "Glam Up The Midterms," an effort to bring awareness to voting in the midterm elections across the country.

"Get ready for the hottest event of the year," Eichner says in the promo video. "No, it's not the Grammys, the Oscars, or the Golden Globes. It's the 2018 midterm elections."

TONIGHT join me, @JimmyKimmel and many more of your favorites as we GET OUT THE VOTE and GLAM UP THE MIDTERMS! Help us!!! Sign up now and join the party: https://t.co/ahkVPrVrh4 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/1jhGmMYrmC — billy eichner (@billyeichner) March 5, 2018

As November approaches, Eichner's mission is to reach as many people across the US as possible, one event at a time -- with help from celebrities (such as Sarah Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver and Chelsea Handler) and people Eichner described as "hometown heroes," local activists and leaders from across the US.

Funny or Die kicked off its midterms initiative with two events in California: one in April in San Diego, featuring Ron Burgundy, Ferrell's infamous "Anchorman" character; and one in May in Los Angeles, at RuPaul's annual "DragCon."

The plan is to hit the road this summer, and go to districts with the most competitive races to encourage people from both sides of the aisle to get to the polls.

"I wanted to take something that feels like or sounds like a chore or a test you take in school -- the midterms -- and turn it into people and make it something hot, the sexiest event of the year," Eichner said. "That's a joke, obviously -- but that's our way with having fun of what can be traditionally a very dry, chore-like process."

Inspired by a tweet

Eichner said he found himself becoming more vocal in the aftermath of the 2016 election.

conan billy eichner game of thrones_00023802.jpg

"As horrendous as I knew Trump would be, what's truly remarkable is that he's somehow worse than I thought," Eichner tweeted in March of 2017, one of many of his tweets criticizing the President.

Ironically, it was a tweet from President Donald Trump that inspired Eichner's idea to launch a political initiative.

"I honestly do not recall exactly what tweet it was because there were so many tweets to make you angry," Eichner said. "But in that moment [in the summer of 2017], I called Mike Farah, the CEO of Funny or Die. I said, 'I think we should join forces and do something related to upcoming midterm elections, because all the tweeting and marching is great and nothing really means as much as voting, in terms of trying to get the country back on track.'"

Then the brainstorming began.

Funny or Die's political aspirations

Obama's appearance on "Between Two Ferns" in 2014 wasn't the first time Funny or Die had ventured into politics.

In 2008, the site debuted "Prop 8 -- The Musical," starring Jack Black, Neil Patrick Harris, Margaret Cho and others, which poked fun at the California ballot initiative that prohibited gay marriage.

A few years later, in 2013, Funny or Die enlisted the help of Alyssa Milano to make a " sextape ," which was actually a video created to educate the public about chemical attacks happening in Syria.

However, following the viral success of Obama and Galifianakis' interview, it became apparent to executives at Funny or Die that politically geared comedy videos have a place on the internet, and that politicians could benefit from doing this type of content, too.

fod between two ferns obama preview_00001907.jpg

"When that episode of 'Between Two Ferns' came out, it was a huge game changer on both sides. We realized we could be doing this kind of stuff all the time," Brad Jenkins, an Obama administration alum who was poached by Funny or Die in 2015, told CNN. "We could be working with nonprofits, foundations, political campaigns, institutions ... and the best comedy writers in the country."

Funny or Die hired Jenkins, who served as associate director in the White House Office of Public Engagement, in hopes of building the company's brand in Washington. In 2016, the company also brought on David Litt, one of Obama's speechwriters.

Since then, Funny or Die's small DC operation has worked with people and organizations from both sides of the aisle to brainstorm and produce lighthearted, politically centric videos to promote political engagement.

Jenkins said he and Eichner looked at data to see what types of initiatives could be most helpful around midterms. The verdict? Homing in on younger people, from both sides of the aisle, who are maybe less tuned in to politics.

"We started talking about how no young person votes in midterms. It's really bad," Jenkins said. "But it's a whole new universe right now, and we don't even know who's going to be inspired and fired up to vote. Young people may completely surprise us this cycle and outvote a lot of different demographics. We're going to do everything we can in a strategic way to focus on races that matter and people who have never voted in midterms before."

"Glam up the Midterms" also serves as a test for the types of initiatives Funny or Die may want to tackle in 2020, Jenkins said.

Kicking off in California

And of course, grassroots voter outreach operations have long been part of each political cycle. Earlier this year, Women's March organizers launched their own midterms initiative "Power to the Polls."

But both Eichner and Jenkins acknowledged they don't want to be atypical Hollywood types who infiltrate small towns and tell voters what they should believe.

And while Eichner himself is not a fan of the Trump administration, he emphasized that "Glam Up The Midterms," like Funny or Die, is nonpartisan.

For its first two events, Funny or Die teamed up with Headcount, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works to promote participation in democracy by signing people up to vote at large events such as music festivals.

The San Diego event took place at Oceanside High School Performing Arts Center, and featured a conversation about the upcoming primary in California's 49th District, where Republican Rep. Darrell Issa's seat is up for grabs.

"The event we did in Issa's district we brought Will Ferrell there -- but in order to come to event you had to sign up for election alerts and commit to voting in the primary," Jenkins said. "With our little event we had close to 5,000 people to sign up to vote in that primary."

At DragCon, a three-day drag culture convention, Eichner joined drag queen superstars Alaska 5000 and Peppermint for a panel. More than 50,000 flocked to DragCon this year, according to event organizers.

"RuPauls DragCon is really a three-day celebration of everything we hold dear as Americans," RuPaul Charles, the creator behind hit reality TV show "RuPaul's Drag Race" and the convention, said in an email interview with CNN. "And ... if freedom-loving Americans don't get their s--t together, we are all going to be stuck living in a country that doesn't allow all of its citizens their constitutional right to be fierce."

Eichner said he was excited to see people show up at these events, and it gave him hope for the events to come (which, he noted, are all still TBD).

"At the end of the day, Funny or Die is an entertainment brand, and I'm an entertainer," he said. "I want this to be fun."
__label__politics (CNN) Monday's Supreme Court decision on how much politics can be involved in the decennial process of redrawing district lines across the country might not, at first glance, seem like much.

After all, the court decided not to decide -- refusing to even consider the question as to whether maps drawn by Democrats in Maryland and Republicans in Wisconsin were unfairly drawn. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts sent the question back to the lower courts to allow for further consideration.

But before you look away from this story, remember the words of the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre: "I can always choose, but I must know that if I do not choose, that is still a choice." And the Supreme Court's decision to not set a standard for what a too-political redistricting map looks like has considerable consequences -- raising the stakes for Democrats in the coming 2018 election.

In November, there are 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot -- 26 of which states are currently controlled by Republicans including massive (and massively important) battleground states like Florida and Ohio. Win in November, and you are in office through (at least) 2022.

In virtually all of those states, the governor has a vote -- or a veto -- on whatever map the state legislature produces following the next census in 2020 and the redistricting of the country's congressional (and state legislative) lines that follows. Currently, Republicans have total control -- governor's mansion and both chambers of the state legislature -- in 25 of the 50 states, according to statistics maintained by the National Conference of State Legislators . Democrats have total control in just seven. Another 17 are split control, with one party in control of the governorship and the other with a majority in at least one of the state legislative bodies.

__label__world (CNN) Leaning out of a helicopter's open door, 500 feet above the ground, David Kennedy is treated to bird's eye views of immense sand dunes and lava fields strewn with giant black domes and boulders. Among these natural wonders are mysterious triangular constructions, a beautifully preserved ghost town and elaborate ancient tombs -- the archaeological treasures which Saudi Arabia hopes will earn it a place on the heritage tourism map.

This other worldly landscape is Al-Ula county. Covering nearly 9,000 square miles (22,500 sq km), in north-west Saudi Arabia, it is about the same size as New Jersey.

Kennedy is part of an international team carrying out what they say is the Kingdom's largest ever archaeological survey, which began in March. Unlike its regional neighbors Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia is not well-known for ancient history. But that might be about to change.

Team members say they have already identified thousands of archaeological sites, found evidence suggesting that people have lived in the area for much longer than was previously thought, and encountered bizarre structures, the function and meaning of which are shrouded in mystery.

This carving dates from the period before 6,000 BC, when ostriches lived in Al-Ula. Climate change records show that after this time, the landscape transitioned from savannah to desert. As the environment dried up, the ostriches were driven south to their current range in Africa.

Amr Al Madani, CEO of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula (RCU), which was established last July to drive the development, hopes the region will welcome its first visitors in four years and that by 2035, once the project is complete, up to 1.5 million tourists will visit annually.

To put that in perspective, 464,000 tourists visited Petra, in Jordan, and 5.4 million visited Egypt in its entirety in 2016.

"Al-Ula will be a living heritage, nature and cultural museum -- a destination that both surprises and delights," says Al Madani.

The birth of Saudi tourism?

Until now, almost all international visitors to Saudi Arabia have been either business travelers or religious pilgrims, but the government says it is opening up the country to mainstream tourism as part of economic reforms designed to end its dependency on oil exports, outlined in its Vision 2030 plan.

As well as Al-Ula, the Kingdom is developing a string of resorts along the Red Sea coast , and a Six Flags-branded theme park in Riyadh. However, a tourist visa that had been expected to launch in April has not yet been released -- a representative of the Saudi government told CNN that regulations are still being reviewed by the Royal Court.

The potential jewel in Saudi Arabia's heritage tourism crown is Mada'in Salih. A collection of 111 spectacular tombs carved into rocky outcrops, and one of four UNESCO world heritage sites in the country, Mada'in Salih was built by the Nabataeans, the same civilization that created the much better-known settlement at Petra in Jordan.

Along with other key sights in Al-Ula, Mada'in Salih is currently closed to the public. It will re-open when the RCU has decided how best to showcase its heritage to large numbers of visitors, while ensuring that it is carefully preserved.

Last September, the commission hired Rebecca Foote, a London-based American archaeologist, to establish an archaeology and cultural heritage department. Her first project is the survey: its aim is to identify and document all remains of past human activity, and create an inventory that will help to determine which sites merit further study, conserving and being developed for tourism.

"It's an extraordinary opportunity," says Foote. "You rarely get the chance to carry out a best-practice, state-of-the-art integrated survey on such a large scale and in a landscape that's largely undisturbed."

Down in the valley

While Kennedy leads the survey of Al-Ula's "hinterland" another group within Foote's team is focused on the project's "core area." Covering 1,100 square miles (2,890 sq km), it encompasses a valley -- also called Al-Ula -- hemmed in by sheer-sided mountains that rise 1,000 feet on both sides.

Once rich in water, the Al-Ula valley has channeled people, and trade, along its wide, flat floor for thousands of years.

Early settlements prospered thanks to passing traders transporting frankincense, myrrh and precious stones. Foote says that the first major city here, Dedan -- now called Al-Khuraybah -- was established during the first millennium BC. "The route from the south to Mesopotamia, Egypt and beyond ran up the western side of the Arabian Peninsula," says Foote. Well-trodden paths linked oasis to oasis, like a dot-to-dot drawing. "The oases provided water for people and animals," says Foote, adding that camels -- which can survive with only occasional access to water -- enabled long-distance trading.

The trade route eventually diminished after seacraft that could safely navigate the treacherous Red Sea were developed.

The valley remained relatively quiet for several hundred years and then boomed again, when Islam was established in the Middle East. "Mecca and Medina became the heartlands of the religion and a destination for pilgrims," says Foote. "Al-Ula lay on the route south from Syria."

In recent years, archaeologists have conducted research around the core area at Mada'in Salih, Al-Khuraybah and Al-Ula Old Town, a ghost town labyrinth of stone and mudbrick houses which -- according to Foote -- was inhabited from at least the 12th century right up until the 1980s.

But the new survey extends to many areas that have never been studied, and involves the use of cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing the field of archaeology.

Flying machines

Jamie Quartermaine, who is leading the survey in the core-area, is a pioneer in high-tech archaeology. "The scale of the work we're doing wouldn't have been possible in the past, using conventional ground survey methods," he says.

The process begins with a flight in a light aircraft equipped with a scanner and camera. "We take very detailed high-resolution photographs from the air," says Quartermaine. "The camera captures objects four inches (10 cms) wide from altitudes up to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters)." The scanners use LIDAR (light imaging, detection and ranging) technology to shoot laser beams to the ground and calculate the precise altitude of each survey point.

The photographic and LIDAR data is then combined to produce a 3D relief map. "It's like GoogleEarth but with a much greater level of detail," says Quartermaine.

A drone takes photos of Al-Ula's archaeological sites.

Once he has identified promising sites, Quartermaine zooms in with drones fitted with powerful cameras. Finally, the team goes in by land. "We use 4X4s to visit sites identified from the air to verify, describe, sketch and photograph them," he says.

Ground research, says Quartermaine, is the only way to see rock art and text found on vertical rock faces that are not visible from above. His team do not have the time or resources to translate the texts, which are written in numerous languages including Aramaic, Arabic, Nabataean, Greek and Latin. Others will do that later.

The rock art, however -- some of which pre-dates the written word -- is already yielding information. "There are pictures of giraffes, ostriches, one elephant, lots of camels and hunting scenes, " says Quartermaine.

The animals provide clues to the age of the artworks. "The giraffes and ostriches date from the period before 6,000 BC, when those species lived here," he says. "Climate change records show that after this time, the landscape transitioned from savannah to desert. As the environment dried up, these animals were driven south to their current range in Africa."

Desert discoveries

The level of preservation in Al-Ula is "staggering," says Quartermaine. In the desert, the remains have not been subjected to water erosion and with so many stones lying around, manmade structures haven't been dismantled for re-use, as often happens elsewhere.

The most commonly found structures in Al-Ula are cairns -- piles of stones that mark graves, sometimes surrounded by low circular or square drystone walls -- which are older than anyone expected.

"We don't have verified dates yet, but it looks as if some may date to at least 4,000 BC," says Foote, adding that some may even stretch back to the Neolithic period (10,000 to 4,500 BC). "It's very exciting because it shows that the history of occupation of the area goes back much further than was known."

Kennedy has been equally astonished by his discoveries in the hinterland. "In 10 days of flying, we found around 4,000 sites," he says. Some graves in this area are unlike any that Kennedy had seen before, with triangular structures positioned to point towards cairns. Kennedy believes they are unique to Al-Ula. "We don't know the significance of the shapes," he says.

Most enigmatic of all, though, are the "gates" -- stone structures that consist of short, wide walls linked by long parallel walls, which look like farm gates when viewed from above. Some in Al-Ula measure 650 feet (200 meters), the length of four Olympic swimming pools. Even larger ones are found elsewhere in the Kingdom.

"Gates are unique to Saudi Arabia. I've never seen anything remotely like them anywhere," says Kennedy. "There are no entry points, and we don't know what they were used for," he says, adding that analysis of aerial photos and ground visits might help to reveal their purpose.

Will tourists come to Saudi?

When tourists arrive in Saudi Arabia, Al-Ula's standout attractions are likely to be Mada'in Salih, Al-Ula Old Town and Al-Khuraybah.

Al-Ula Old Town.

Saudi Arabia is collaborating with experts from around the world on the Al-Ula development and in April signed a 10-year deal with France that includes provisions for hotels, transport infrastructure and a world-class culture and art museum.

Al-Madani anticipates that 50% of visitors will come from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, the other 50% will be from overseas.

But will Saudi Arabia face challenges reconciling international tourism with its conservative Islamic population and values? It has been reported that only women over the age of 25 will be allowed to visit without a male chaperone, and they will be expected to cover their bodies in searing temperatures.

"I think they've got a problem selling Saudi Arabia in competition with, say, Jordan, which is a much more relaxed Middle Eastern society," says Neil Faulkner, an archaeologist and historian who leads tours to Jordan and Egypt.

Gina Morello, from Dallas, Texas, toured Saudi Arabia earlier this year -- entering the country on a business visa. She admits to some pre-trip nerves, especially around clothing rules. "When I saw Western women ... they just had the abayas (long cloaks) on and no head scarf," she says, adding that she, too, did not don a headscarf for most of the trip. Wearing an abaya made her feel uncomfortable, however, because of the physical restriction and loss of identity.

"There just weren't a ton of women walking around," she says. But people were unexpectedly friendly and warm. "In one park women wanted to take pictures with us ... doing selfies and the peace sign."

Al Madani believes that travelers' inherent desire to experience new places will outweigh such concerns. "Once here, people will enjoy our hospitality and authenticity, be accepting of the local traditions and customs and respect the norms and values of the communities they are engaging with."

Faulkner says a second barrier is the perception of the Middle East as dangerous, unstable and potentially hostile to Western visitors. "It has had a huge impact on cultural tourism across the region for the last 15 years," he says, adding that the tourist industry has declined even in relatively safe destinations. He believes that Saudi Arabia faces an uphill challenge, pointing to their involvement in the war in Yemen and long-running regional conflict with Iran.

"Security is, of course, an important element in anyone's decision to travel," says Al Madani, "but there have been very few, if any, incidents affecting travelers or tourists in Saudi in recent years, and we will continue to work hard to ensure this remains so."

Ultimately, he believes that Al-Ula's archaeological treasure trove is strong enough to draw crowds to a country that has long captured the world's imagination.
__label__world London (CNN) The Benin bronzes are universally recognized as a towering achievement in the history of art.

Artists of the once-mighty Kingdom of Benin, in present day Edo State, Nigeria, honed sophisticated techniques over centuries to craft detailed depictions of life in the Kingdom, from court scenes to foreign soldiers.

Thousands of the finest examples went on display at the palace of the king.

The collection was looted wholesale in 1897 when the British army sacked the palace and razed the kingdom in a punitive expedition.

The bronzes were sold and scattered across Western museums, where they met with astonishment and prompted revisions of racist assumptions about African art.

Since independence, the Nigerian government has intermittently pressed claims for restitution of the bronzes, which the museums have resisted.

But a solution to the impasse may be at hand.

Creative solution

The Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) was formed in 2007 with the task of facilitating a permanent display of bronzes in Benin City.

The BDG bought together representatives of Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), the Royal Court of Benin, and several European museums with bronze collections.

The most significant artworks are housed at the British Museum in London and the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.

The group is now exploring the possibility of loaning artifacts back to Nigeria.

A spokesperson for the British Museum said a recent BDG meeting ended with a proposal "to work towards a permanent, but rotating, exhibition of loaned objects" to Nigeria.

The British Museum and others are open to contributing to this collection. Negotiations are at an early stage with no timescale established.

Crusoe Osagie, Special Adviser to Governor Obaseki Godwin of Edo State, told CNN that the administration favors permanent restitution, although he added that "in the event of not getting our wishes we have to negotiate."

"A loan is not what we want or the best choice," he said. "But in the absence of another choice, we can start with that."

Whose property?

A loan arrangement may offer a way of bypassing the fraught issue of ownership.

The British Museum has rebuffed claims for permanent restitution of the bronzes, citing laws against museums disposing of assets.

Officials have also argued the Museum can offer greater access and superior curation for the bronzes as justification for keeping them in Britain.

"The Trustees' view is that there is great value in presenting objects from the Kingdom of Benin in a global context, alongside the stories of other cultures," the Museum spokesperson said.

Osagie does not accept the Museum's claim to the bronzes.

"The question is whose property is this?" he says. "Whose culture is this and whose story does it tell? Europe is more accessible to most people around the world, but these items belong to us."

Osagie adds that the Nigerian government could pursue compensation for the century the bronzes have spent abroad.

"If these items have been building revenue and income for people over the past decades - items that don't belong to them, that were forcefully removed through violence - it is fair to say that they owe us."

A suitable home

The bronzes' passage home could be smoothed by a proposed new 'world class' museum in Benin City.

In April, Governor Obaseki announced plans for a new facility adjacent to the King's Palace and expressed hope this would "encourage curators across Europe and other parts of the world to be confident and support the advocacy for the stolen artifacts of Benin Kingdom."

Sixteenth-Century Head of a Queen mother of Benin loan to the Royal Academy of Arts in London by the National Commission for Museums and Monuments returned to Nigeria on January 16, 2013.

Martin Bailey, Senior Correspondent for The Art Newspaper, says the lack of an elite venue in Benin City has been a barrier to regaining what he calls "arguably the finest works of art that have been created in sub-Saharan Africa."

"Until now there has not really been a suitable place to lend objects of this importance," says Bailey. "The British Museum will have to think more carefully if and when the (Benin) museum is built."

But he adds "not all plans are realized - and I suspect very little will happen until the museum is actually built."

Opening the floodgates?

The case of the Benin bronzes could set a significant precedent.

Many museums in Britain and Europe hold valuable artifacts seized in colonial times and face mounting pressure to return them. Loans could offer a release valve.

The Ethiopian government is seeking the Magdala Treasures, including ancient jewelry, clothing, and manuscripts, taken by the British Army in 1868 and now held at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.

The museum's director Tristram Hunt has proposed a long-term loan of the artifacts.

The Egyptian government is pursuing a loan of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum, which has offered to loan the Elgin Marbles to Greece.

But few governments have been willing to weaken their claims to lost treasures by accepting a loan deal.

Western political leaders are also voicing support for permanent restitution.

France's President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to return looted artifacts to Africa. UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for the Elgin Marbles to be returned to Greece - "as with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession."

With growing demands from dispossessed countries for the return of artifacts and increasing recognition of the dubious provenance of such artworks in former colonial-power nations, museums face a struggle to justify continued ownership of contested collections.

Whether through permanent restitution or creative compromise, many stolen treasures could be heading home.

__label__world Beijing, China (CNN) Chinese President Xi Jinping heads to Africa this week as Beijing moves to further cement its role as one of the continent's closest economic and diplomatic allies.

After a brief stop in the Persian Gulf Thursday, Xi's itinerary -- his first overseas trip since beginning his second term as leader -- takes him to Senegal, Rwanda, South Africa and Mauritius, spanning almost every corner of Sub-Saharan Africa, where China's economic clout, and strategic ambitions, are growing by the year.

China is Africa's largest trading partner, overtaking the United States nearly a decade ago. Bilateral trade reached a record-high of $220 billion in 2014, official statistics show.

Chinese leaders have always made a point of visiting African nations regularly and early during their time in power. When he assumed the presidency in 2013, Xi also chose Africa as part of his maiden journey abroad and went on to visit the continent two more times during his first term.

China's interest in Africa isn't just about trade, the continent also provides a large amount of raw materials which China couldn't get otherwise, while also acting as a pro-China political bloc at the United Nations.

Ian Taylor, an Africa expert at the University of St. Andrews, said the US is increasingly losing its influence on the continent because it "took Africa for granted."

"The Americans seem to look at Africa through this security lens ... which is completely different from the Chinese perspective," he said. "They look at it from an economic perspective -- the Americans are lagging big time."

'Spreading the love'

Xi's exact itinerary has yet to be released, but he will return to South Africa on July 25 to take part in the BRICS summit, alongside Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

At first look, Rwanda and Senegal appear unusual choices given they don't receive a large amount of investment from China nor are they large countries in terms of population.

But Taylor, the St. Andrews professor, points to Rwanda's key position in the Belt and Road plan, Xi's ambitious global trade and investment scheme which aims to enhance economic connectivity between Asia, Europe and East Africa.

"Rwanda is hoping to integrate itself into the burgeoning railway networks in East Africa, as part of the Belt and Road initiative," he said. "Kigali is moving towards diversifying its relationship away from the US, away from the European Union, and China sees a good opportunity to develop ties."

China's new President Xi Jinping (L) and Congo's Denis Sassou Nguesso President cut the ribbon on March 30, 2013, during Xi's first foreign trip.

For Senegal, there have been suggestions the Chinese government might be interested in the possibility of building ports on the Atlantic Ocean.

Gordon G. Chang, an American political commentator best known for his book "The Coming Collapse of China," said the selection of Senegal and Mauritius, respectively, is consistent with China's attempts to establish a presence on Africa's Atlantic coast and to dominate the Indian Ocean.

"It's amazing how well the Chinese do (in Africa) -- because they are unopposed," he said.

Taylor said the diverse itinerary shows the Chinese leadership is "spreading the (diplomatic) love" across African nations, to boost Beijing's influence in the region.

"This is massively appreciated in most African countries, especially by the political elites, the way in which China quite uniquely in some respects treats all countries at an equal level ... at least rhetorically and in the diplomatic process," he said.

Neo-colonialism?

Chinese analysts view the ever-closer bilateral ties with African nations as a natural result of the Beijing leadership's decades-long cultivation of relations with the continent, dating back to the early days of the Communist government in the 1950s.

"The importance of Africa in China's diplomacy has been consistent," said He Wenping, an Africa expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a state-run think tank. "The Belt and Road initiative has only accentuated the role of Africa even more."

Already, Chinese-built infrastructure -- railways, roads, dams, telecommunication networks and power stations -- is rapidly changing the physical appearance of Africa.

Chinese-owned mines and factories churning out everything ranging from minerals to shoes -- combined with an influx of big-spending Chinese tourists -- are redefining the continent's economic landscape, while Chinese-funded educational programs and media outlets have grown in size and increased their influence over young Africans.

China is also bolstering its diplomatic and military presence on the continent, becoming more active in UN peacekeeping missions and even opening its first overseas naval base in Djibouti last year -- with the latter move triggering alarm in Washington and other Western capitals.

Problems and controversies have emerged along with China's expanding footprint in Africa, with critics labeling the country a "neo-colonialist" only interested in exploiting the continent's rich resources and cheap labor. Activists have highlighted cases of human rights abuse that include ill treatment and poor pay of local workers.

He, the CASS expert, acknowledges "growing pains" in bilateral ties but said there were tangible economic rewards for both sides.

"If African nations feel colonized, why would they keep cooperating with China?" she said. "It would be an insult to the African people's wisdom -- they clearly know how to maximize their benefits in cooperating with China."

One thing analysts did agree on, however, is Beijing's commitment to Africa -- which even critic Chang described as "deep and widespread" -- as reflected by Chinese leaders' frequent visits, in contrast to Washington's relative lack of attention to much of the continent.

"The US needs to do so much more -- you don't have American presidents going to Africa that often, which is a shame," Chang added.

"Africa is not on the US agenda," He said, before taking a swipe at the US president's reported off-the-cuff remarks early this year when discussing immigration policy with lawmakers. "And when Trump mentions Africa, he calls them 'shithole countries'."
__label__politics Vega: "Is Russia still targeting the US, Mr. President?"

Trump: "Thank you very much, no."

Vega: "No, you don't believe that to be the case?"

Trump: "Thank you very much everybody. We're doing very well, probably as well as anybody has ever done with Russia. There's been no President ever as tough as I have been on Russia."

According to the President of the United States, Russia is done attacking the United States' voting process as a way to sow broader discord and doubt about Western democracies. Which is reassuring! Except that it appears to be totally and completely wrong, contradicting repeated assertions from senior members of Trump's own Cabinet that Russia views their 2016 election meddling as a giant success and is already at work in trying to influence the 2018 elections and beyond.

Just last Friday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats made clear not only that he believes Russia to be targeting the US, but that the threat posed is real and concerning. "The warning signs are there," Coats said. "The system is blinking. It is why I believe we are at a critical point. Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack."

So, yeah. And that's far from the only time that Coats -- not to mention Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- has said publicly that the threat posed by Russia is real and active. Here are a few others:

"I have to say there is more work to do," Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in May. "We have not been able to achieve deterrence, effective deterrence of some of these efforts of the Russians." Added Pompeo: "We are at risk in 2018 and 2020 ... we are always at risk."

"At a minimum, we expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokespeople, and other means of influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States," Coats said at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in February. "There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations."

"Russian activities during 2016 election may have been aimed at one party's candidate, but as my colleague senator Rubio says frequently, in 2018 and 2020, it could be aimed at anyone, at home or abroad," said Republican Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr in June.

There's simply no one who is in a position to know who believes that Russia has ceased targeting the United States. In fact, everyone in a position to know -- with the exception of Trump -- believes Russia is already actively underway with significant disruption efforts aimed at the November midterm elections.

So why would Trump say something that runs directly -- and, I mean DIRECTLY -- contrary to what the entire intelligence community in this country not only believes but has said time and time again publicly?

It's possible -- I guess -- that he either misunderstood or misheard the question. But if you listen to the tape of the back-and-forth, Vega is the only person asking a question and there's not much din in the room that would have made it hard for Trump to hear.

In fact, that's the position the Trump administration took on Wednesday afternoon, in the wake of Trump's comments. "The President was saying 'no' to answering questions," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. "We are certainly taking steps so they can't do it again," she added in reference to Russian election interference. "We believe that the threat still exists."

It's much more likely that Trump said Russia isn't targeting the US because it's what he wants to believe. Remember that he spent the last 48 hours -- and, really, the last 18 months as President -- ignoring or playing down the intelligence findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 election for the purpose of helping Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton. So it's not all that much of a stretch for Trump to say that Russia isn't targeting the US anymore either.

For Trump, "Russian interference" = "I didn't win fair and square." And he can't take that. He simply will not de-couple the proven fact of Russian meddling in the election from his own insecurities about winning the White House without anyone's help or aid. Asking anything about Russia targeting -- either past, present or future -- is like waving a red cape in front of a bull. Trump can't resist charging it. It's Pavlovian.

But that's no excuse. Coming off a disastrous news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday -- and an equally botched clean-up of that news conference -- Trump is, yet again, publicly disagreeing with the findings of his intelligence community as it relates to Russia's strategic initiatives to undermine American democracy.

It's easy to lump this in with all of the other abnormal things Trump does each and every day in the White House. But this is a very big deal. And it's a pattern of behavior. Trump just keeps making excuses for Russia and finding ways to undermine what his own intelligence agencies are telling him about the threat posed by Putin and his country. Don't underplay that. It's a big, big, big problem.

__label__politics Abingdon, Virginia (CNN) A tale of two Virginia districts explains why the geographic, demographic and cultural chasm between the parties in the House of Representatives is about to grow much wider -- with ominous implications for America's escalating political tensions.

In the affluent, diverse, 10th Congressional District of Virginia in the Washington suburbs, a sharp backlash against President Trump has left Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock as perhaps the nation's most endangered GOP incumbent. Simultaneously, in the preponderantly white, working-class and rural 9th Congressional District of Virginia, which includes this picturesque town in the state's far southwestern corner, Trump's popularity is reinforcing the strength of Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith, who captured the seat from a veteran Democrat during the GOP landslide of 2010.

The contrasting prospects for Comstock and Griffith crystallize how the 2018 election could complete the geographic restructuring of the House that first fully snapped into view during that GOP sweep eight years ago.

We have had two countries for a while, but it is as if, appropriately enough under Trump, the walls are being raised. They are higher than ever.

In 2010, amid a sharp backlash against President Barack Obama, the GOP ousted dozens of House Democrats from small-town and rural districts; the casualties included many who had held their seats for decades, like Rick Boucher, the longtime Democratic representative from the 9th District who Griffith beat. Now the GOP faces the inverse risk: Democrats in November could sweep out 20 or more House Republicans like Comstock from districts centered on white-collar suburbs around the nation's biggest cities where Trump is unpopular.

"This could be very easily be a mirror image election (to 2010) from the Democratic side," says Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a leading House Republican strategist.

The biggest question for November, of course, is whether Democrats will gain the 24 seats they need to recapture the House majority. But whether or not they do, November could produce a realigning election that remakes the composition of the parties' coalitions in the House. Just as 2010 triggered an extended period of Republican advantage in small-town and rural districts, 2018 could do the same for Democrats in white-collar seats inside the largest metropolitan areas.

The trench separating red and blue America

In suburbs and rural areas, a lot of congressional districts used to split their votes between congressional and presidential elections. That's not happening nearly as much. A wave in 2010 swept a lot of Democrats out of rural areas. The same could happen in 2018 with Republicans in suburbs.

The result would be a geographic separation in the House as stark as any in modern times. Democrats seem likely to emerge from this fall's election with a clear upper hand in highly urbanized House seats that are racially and religiously diverse, disproportionately white-collar and secular and connected to the globalized information economy. Republicans, in turn, could remain dominant in districts outside of urban centers that are preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar, more religiously traditional and reliant on manufacturing, agriculture and resource extraction. The ideological, demographic, economic and even physical distance between the coalitions -- the trench separating red and blue America -- could be even greater than it is today.

"You look at the map -- and any (place) that has a disproportionately rural electorate -- and you can count it as Republican in any election, and the opposite is true in those suburban/urban" areas, says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. "We have had two countries for a while, but it is as if, appropriately enough under Trump, the walls are being raised. They are higher than ever. And I'm afraid that is going to be even more true in 2020 than in 2018."

As opposed to a wave, this looks like a realignment and that's scarier. Former Republican Rep. Tom Davis

This accelerating separation leaves both parties in a precarious position. Many Republicans worry that under Trump they are losing support in the places that are adding population and jobs and increasingly relying on the places that are shrinking or stagnating on both fronts.

"As opposed to a wave, this (election) looks like a realignment and that's scarier," says Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia, who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his years in the House. "That is a bigger problem for Republicans long term, because we are winning the places that are not the growing tide (in population), they are the shrinking tide, and that's not where you want to be."

Some Democrats, in turn, fear that even greater dominance of the largest metropolitan areas will still leave them operating with too narrow a geographic base of support to consistently control majorities not only in the House, but also in the Senate and the Electoral College. In 2016, after all, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by obliterating Trump in the largest places -- she won 87 of the 100 largest counties by more than 15 million votes combined -- yet Trump carried the Electoral College by routing her outside of the big urban areas in enough of the battleground states, from North Carolina and Florida to Michigan and Wisconsin.

"If you can combine a ... respectable showing in some of these other areas of the country with obviously growing strength in urban and inner suburban areas and white-collar constituencies, then you have a winning formula," says long-term Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira. "The strength in these (metropolitan) areas can be canceled out by the structural problems in these other (small-town) areas."

The divergent dynamics separating suburban and small-town America are neatly encapsulated in Virginia's 9th and 10th congressional districts. Though each is now represented by a Republican, the two places could hardly be more different. Whites represent almost 90% of the population in the 9th District, but only about 61% in the 10th. Immigrants (largely Hispanic and Asian) represent over 20% of the population in the 10th but less than 3% in the 9th. Just over half of the adults in the 10th District hold at least a four-year college degree, compared with only about 1-in-5 in the 9th. The median income in the 10th, at $120,384, is nearly triple its level in the 9th, less than $42,000.

Class inversion

The fact that Democratic prospects are rising in the district that is more affluent, better-educated and more racially diverse and are sagging in the district that is the opposite on each count testifies to the larger shifts that have remade the two parties' electoral coalitions over the past several decades. Particularly since the 1980s, the parties have experienced what I've called a "class inversion," with Republicans growing stronger among the blue-collar whites who anchored the Democratic coalition for decades after World War II and Democrats adding growing competitiveness among white-collar whites (especially women) to their traditional advantages among nonwhite voters.

Typically, such changes in electoral behavior have been felt at the presidential level long before they filter down to congressional races. Republicans, for instance, started consistently winning Southern states at the presidential level in 1972 but didn't capture a majority of the region's congressional seats until 1994. Similarly, while Republicans built a solid advantage in small-town and rural areas at the presidential level starting in 2000, they did not immediately beat many of the House Democrats representing those areas.

These divisions don't start in Washington DC and come down; they are in the country and working up. Republican Rep. Tom Cole

Instead, the watershed election came in 2010 for rural and small-town Democratic House members such as Rick Boucher, who had held his Southwest Virginia seat for nearly 30 years. Boucher had deep roots in the district: He was born in Abingdon, and his grandfather had represented the area in the Virginia House of Delegates. He still remembers the town when it followed more bucolic rhythms.

"It was a place where farmers came to market and brought their goods," Boucher told me recently in an interview in the backyard of his home on Abingdon's peaceful main street. "The downtown on Saturdays was packed. People were walking from one end of town to the other."

Boucher represented the area in the Virginia state Senate for eight years, and then in 1982 he beat a longtime Republican incumbent to win the area's congressional seat. Boucher had a close squeeze in 1984, when he narrowly survived the Ronald Reagan landslide to win a second term. After that, he won re-election to Virginia's 9th Congressional District 12 more times, never capturing less than 59% of the vote, even as his culturally conservative, coal-producing and rural district steadily tilted its votes toward Republican presidential candidates. Republican presidential nominees George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 each carried nearly three-fifths of the district.

Swept out in a wave

Former Democratic Rep. Rick Boucher lost his rural Virginia seat in 2010.

Boucher survived by avoiding cultural conflicts wherever possible (he opposed President Bill Clinton's key gun-control initiatives, for instance) and concentrating on bread-and-butter economic concerns.

"What I was doing through all of those years was attracting federal funds to build industrial parks, water systems, wastewater systems. I developed my own program for attracting industry," he recalls.

But in 2010, Boucher's string ran out. Obama's first two years had stirred a huge conservative backlash in the district, with both the Affordable Care Act and the legislation passed by House Democrats to limit the carbon emissions linked to global climate change emerging as powerful flashpoints. Republican nominee Griffith, a former GOP majority leader in the state House, particularly emphasized Boucher's support for the "cap and trade" bill restricting carbon emissions, which was anathema in the area's coal-producing communities.

I'm tickled to death he's our President. Mark Matney on Donald Trump

For Mark Matney, a teacher in Abingdon who usually votes Republican but had sometimes supported Boucher, that was the breaking point.

"When people wanted something done and they went to Rick, he seemed to get it done. I mean, I've seen many families he helped," Matney told me. "Then when Obama come in, Rick helped author cap and trade. It was at that moment when it got bad. When he done that with cap and trade, it was like he wasn't representing his people anymore."

Boosted by heavy spending from outside conservative groups who linked Boucher to Obama and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in a barrage of television advertising, Griffith, a Republican state House member, blew past the Democrat in 2010 by nearly 10,000 votes.

Boucher was hardly alone: The 2010 election virtually annihilated the center-right so-called "blue dog" Democratic House members, who mostly represented preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar, small-town and rural districts. Among those swept away that fall were Jim Oberstar in Minnesota (first elected in 1974), Gene Taylor from Mississippi (1989, in a special election), Ike Skelton of Missouri (1976), Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota (1992), Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania (1984), John Spratt of South Carolina (1982) and Chet Edwards of Texas (1990), as well as a long list of small-town Democrats who had won more recently.

Jon Vogel, now a Democratic consultant, was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the GOP's 2010 sweep. He says it wasn't complacency that doomed the blue dog rural Democrats, it was that many voters who had long split their tickets between local Democrats and presidential Republicans were no longer willing to do so with Obama in the White House.

"I don't think anyone was caught napping," Vogel says. "All of those guys got ready and ran their campaigns, but you couldn't survive what was coming. You couldn't overcome the DNA of the district, no matter how good a campaign you ran."

Republicans have since solidified their hold over Boucher's old district. Griffith has carried at least three-fifths of the vote in each of his three re-elections. While Boucher and other Democrats view their 2018 nominee, farmer Anthony Flaccavento, as an energetic candidate, Griffith remains a strong favorite in part because of Trump's solid popularity here. Trump carried 68% of the vote in the 9th District in 2016 (the most in any Virginia US House district) and Matney says none of the personal and political controversies swirling around the President have dented his standing with conservatives here.

"To be 100% honest with you, no," he says. "They think that he's up there to do what we want him to do: protect our guns, protect our rights, less government, more jobs. That's all they see, and I'm tickled to death he's our President."

Trump's strong approval ratings among the white non-college and Christian voters who constitute a larger share of small-town and rural districts represent a huge headwind for Democrats in such places this fall. The party is targeting several Republicans in seats that fit that description, such as the northeast Iowa seat held by Rod Blum, the northern Maine seat held by Bruce Poliquin, John Faso's upstate New York seat and Rodney Davis' district in downstate Illinois.

Democratic tailwinds in the suburbs

Amanda Kelly had never been involved in politics. Frustration after 2016 has her working to defeat her Republican congresswoman.

I thought, 'No way, he's not going to win,' but when he did, I decided I had to start doing something because Congress is the only check. Amanda Kelly

But, by far, the Democrats' best opportunities are clustered in urban and suburban areas. In those places, Trump faces much lower approval ratings than usual for a Republican president among college-educated white voters, especially women. In the latest Quinnipiac University national poll, Trump's net disapproval rating among college-educated whites (19 points negative) was almost exactly as bad as Obama's among blue-collar whites in Pew Research Center polling (20 points negative) just before Republicans routed the small-town House Democrats in 2010.

With that tailwind, Democrats are pursuing Republican-held suburban seats in every region. In the East, they have multiple opportunities around New York City, Philadelphia, Miami and New Jersey; in Virginia, they have a strong shot not only at Comstock but also at Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who holds a seat centered on the Richmond suburbs that swung toward Democrats in last fall's gubernatorial and state House elections. In the Midwest, Democrats are targeting suburban Republican-held seats around Chicago; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Des Moines, Iowa; and more distantly Omaha, Nebraska. In the far West, Democrats have good chances in suburban Republican-held seats around Los Angeles and nearby Orange County; Tucson, Arizona; Denver; San Antonio; and Seattle. Democrats are also seriously contesting seats in Sunbelt metro areas that have previously been considered safe for Republicans, including districts around Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; and Houston.

Mirror image of 2010

The Republican losses in white-collar House seats this year almost certainly won't match the Democratic retreat in blue-collar seats in 2010 because the GOP doesn't have quite as many members in seats that have moved away from the party at the presidential level. But the general dynamic, and direction, of change could prove very similar: The suburban Republicans in 2018, like the small-town Democrats in 2010, are standing on floorboards of support that have been rotting for years -- and may not be able to survive the added weight of hardening discontent with a President from their party.

Comstock's embattled situation in Virginia's 10th District captures that problem. First elected in 2014, Comstock won re-election in 2016 with 53% of the vote, although Clinton carried 52% there. With Trump in office, though, the district broke decisively last November for Democrat Ralph Northam over Republican Ed Gillespie in the governor's race and swept out several Republicans holding seats in the state House that overlapped with Comstock's seat.

The first general election public poll in the district, by Monmouth University, showed the Democratic nominee, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, leading Comstock by an imposing 10 percentage points. A 53% majority of the district's voters said they disapproved of Trump's performance, and more than four-fifths of them said they intended to vote against Comstock.

"I think everybody is looking at her race and saying, 'How in the world does she win?' " says Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist.

Like many suburban Republicans, Comstock is running in a diversifying district (Hispanics, Asians and minorities who classify themselves as "other" combine for about 32% of the population). Democrats are hoping for the same kind of strong turnout among them that helped Kathy Tran, a refugee from South Vietnam, win a House of Delegates seat last fall in a district that overlaps with Comstock's.

"I think that the energy that we really helped to start in 2017 is ... going (to) be a huge tsunami in November," said Tran, who became one of the first two Asian-American women in the state House. "My experience in Virginia has been that we have turned the corner and the vast majority of people want a welcoming and inclusive commonwealth."

Rep. Barbara Comstock speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill.

Comstock, like the other suburban Republicans, also risks being caught in the backlash against Trump among many college-educated white voters, especially women. (In the Monmouth poll, 60% of the district's whites with a college degree disapproved of Trump's performance.) And she is confronting a surge of energy among liberal-leaning voters, even many of those who had not previously been politically active.

Amanda Kelly, a retail store manager from Bluemont, is one of those. She didn't vote until she was 30 (for Obama in 2008) and before the 2016 election couldn't name her governor or US representative. All that changed after Trump's victory.

"At the rallies I saw violence, I saw racism, assault, terrible things (and) I thought, 'No way, he's not going to win,' " she says. "But when he did, I decided I had to start doing something, because Congress is the only check."

Now Kelly has become a tireless activist in Indivisible, the grass-roots Democratic group committed to opposing Trump, as well as other local political organizations; in the 24 hours before I spoke with her last month, she had participated in two separate demonstrations (one that required her to arrive at 4 a.m. to start setting up) over Trump's family separation practice.

"People feel really passionate," she says. "You know, fortunately Trump provides a lot of fodder for that."

Over 300 miles away in the state's far southwest corner, Matney is just as passionate in his embrace of Trump and his determination to maintain the Republican congressional majority that supports and defends the President. If anything, Matney says, as a socially conservative Republican he feels more connected to Trump in office than he did as a candidate.

These clashing perspectives demonstrate why the midterm election is less likely to produce a wave that rolls equally across the country than a split-level current that carries metropolitan America closer to the Democrats without seriously breaching the Republican fortress beyond it. That could leave the Congress, and the country, glaring across demographic and geographic divides etched as sharply as during the most polarized times in American history.

"It means legislative gridlock," says Cole, the Republican representative from Oklahoma. "I always tell people I don't have a Democratic member of Congress who lives within 200 miles of me in any direction. These divisions don't start in Washington, DC, and come down; they are in the country and working up. ... We have been seeing this coming for a while. But we really are in an age of regionalization of politics that is reminiscent of the 1850s."
__label__politics (CNN) With the recent criminal indictment of 12 Russian intelligence agents , the special counsel's office made clear it has a treasure trove of information for its investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. What's less obvious is how long Robert Mueller will continue his work.

The indictment could be the high point for his team. Or it could be simply the crest of one of several coming waves.

An investigative interview of President Donald Trump, likely regarding Mueller's probe into whether the President obstructed justice, still hangs in the air. So do the legs of the investigation involving former campaign chairman Paul Manafort's role on the campaign, and involving former national security adviser Michael Flynn's cooperation with investigators.

There are already some signs that Mueller's office is prepared for an ultimate wind-down. Prosecutors from the US Attorney's Office in Washington and the Department of Justice's national security division are working on cases brought by Mueller, signaling that they'll see them through if the special counsel's office disappears before the court actions conclude.

And federal prosecutors in Manhattan separate from Mueller are handling the investigation into the president's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, which may touch on payments to women with whom Trump allegedly had extramarital affairs during the campaign.

Even so, Mueller still appears to be shepherding several related investigations that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein laid out in a memo for Mueller last August. The memo appears to describe the scope of the investigation point by point. Almost a full page of the discussion of Mueller's scope is still hidden from public view.

Yet some parts of the still-secret investigation have become evident.

The President

Chiefly, there's no conclusive public finding yet into whether Trump intended to obstruct justice or knew of illegal coordination — if there was any -- between his campaign and the Russian government.

A conclusion may not come before the end of the year, given the timing of the midterm elections.

Under Justice Department custom, prosecutors generally avoid overt investigative steps and returning indictments against a candidate for office within 60 days of an election. That rule is not set forth in any official policy or regulation, however. Mueller could always ask Rosenstein for an exception. Or he could look at the example of former FBI Director James Comey, who was roundly criticized for making a statement on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails 11 days before the 2016 presidential election.

One investigative step that appears to be in Mueller's plan is interviewing the President.

The possibility of an investigatory interview with Trump has haunted the Oval Office for half a year now, as the President's then-attorneys John Dowd and Ty Cobb, and later Rudy Giuliani and others, have gone back and forth with Mueller.

If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, a grand jury subpoena to force Trump to talk could be in the works. That would likely lead to a fight over presidential power under the Constitution — and may end up at the Supreme Court.

Perhaps Mueller doesn't need Trump on the record. He already has dozens of witness interviews, plus hundreds of Trump's own tweets, public speeches and on-camera interviews.

If Mueller chose not to indict the President, he will likely present his findings in a report to Congress. That could include a recommendation to impeach Trump.

Flynn still helping

Former national security adviser Michael Flynn cut a plea deal with investigators last December. There has been no apparent conclusion to that part of the investigation, and the amount of information Flynn has given them hasn't yet become public.

Flynn has spoken with prosecutors about his conversations during the presidential transition. Those conversations relayed details from the Russian ambassador to senior Trump campaign officials including Jared Kushner, according to his charging documents.

At a court appearance last week, a federal judge made clear Flynn hasn't been sentenced yet for lying to investigators because he continues to cooperate with prosecutors. That signals that more criminal cases related to what Flynn knows could be coming.

Manafort fears more

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been charged on crimes related to his Ukrainian lobbying and financial disclosures. Manafort says he is not guilty and is awaiting two trials, with the first set to start July 25.

Rick Gates, Manafort's longtime deputy and another top Trump campaign and inauguration official, hasn't appeared in public since he pleaded guilty in February to lesser charges than he first faced. Gates is now helping Mueller's office, likely with the prosecution's cases against Manafort.

He could also be contributing to other parts of the investigation. Mueller's team initially sought Gates' help to accomplish its central mission of investigating the campaign and Russian collusion, CNN reported in March.

Prosecutors haven't yet said publicly what they'll do with Manafort's Russian connections during the campaign. His attorneys have said in court they believe Mueller continues to investigate him.

Russian threads

Then there are the Russians. The hack of the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign during 2016 fell into Mueller's purview from the start. Those charges surfaced July 13, when Mueller's team indicted 12 Russian military intelligence agents for their alleged conspiracy. But several unnamed people in the indictment -- including a congressional candidate who allegedly asked the Russians for stolen emails, plus entities that appear to be WikiLeaks and Trump adviser Roger Stone, who communicated with the hackers -- haven't been charged.

Mueller's team also said in a court filing late Monday night that even before Mueller started work last May, federal officials were looking into another group of Russians. Those Russians, a team of Russians and Russian companies that distributed anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda over social media, have since been charged.

What else?

That leaves several possible threads that Mueller's office has pulled on and have yet to resolve. What will become of the case about Stone, who's had several of his associates testify before Mueller's grand jury? CNN reported that Mueller's team has been in a court tangle with the attorneys of a former employee of Stone's. Their hour-and-a-half-long sealed hearing on July 18 suggests the grand jury investigation of Stone presses on.

Is there more to George Papadopoulos' dealings with the campaign that Mueller will pursue? The public will likely learn more in September about Papadopoulos' cooperation with the special counsel's office, in advance of and when he is sentenced. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his contacts with Trump campaign officials and suspected Russian agents. While he worked on the Trump campaign and before the hackers leaked their stolen materials, Papadopoulos reportedly learned the Russians could offer "political dirt" on Hillary Clinton. That hasn't yet tied back to Mueller's case against the hackers who distributed that "dirt."

Finally, what did Mueller find about that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between the top campaign officials and Russians?

A definitive end?

In the court papers Monday related to the Russian troll farm, Mueller's team wrote about how their investigation will reach a definitive end.

When it does, Mueller will have to provide Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein a confidential report explaining his decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute. Rosenstein gets to sign off on every potential criminal case and would have to tell Congress if the Justice Department decides not to pursue a case the Mueller's office recommends.

Mueller's team acknowledges that their work could always be cut short -- if Rosenstein makes it so. Mueller could be fired for misconduct or "good cause," such as violating Department of Justice policies, or Rosenstein could choose to end the investigation.

There's one more way for Mueller's investigation to naturally end: If Rosenstein wants, he could let it expire with the end of the federal government's fiscal year, which is September 30, according to the court filing.

"Special counsels appointed under the regulation can be expected to have a limited time horizon and the investigation a definite endpoint," the prosecutors wrote. "The lifespan and scope of the investigation at all times stay within the [acting] Attorney General's control."
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) South African comedian Trevor Noah is facing heavy criticism after a video of a stand-up routine from 2013 where he made a joke about Australia's Aboriginal women resurfaced online.

Australians on social media are now calling for a boycott of his tour scheduled to begin with a performance at Melbourne's Hisense Arena on August 23.

Noah can be seen making a joke about Aboriginal women in the video, which was first shared by Australian photographer, LaVonne Bobongie.

__label__world The prepared statement of US President Donald Trump is seen on his desk as he speaks to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, July 17. Trump was clarifying remarks he made the day before at his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On his papers was a handwritten addition he made that said "THERE WAS NO COLUSION" -- with the final word missing an L. During his joint news conference with Putin, Trump declined to endorse the US intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, saying Putin was "extremely strong and powerful" in his denial. Back in Washington, facing bipartisan fury over his glowing remarks about Putin, Trump said he misspoke, and he voiced his support for US intelligence agencies and vowed to take action to prevent further attacks.
__label__world (CNN) The highest UN court ruled on Monday that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) discriminated against Qataris during last year's blockade.

The UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, imposed an unprecedented diplomatic freeze of Qatar in June 2017 , in which it blocked transport and severed diplomatic ties, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region. Qatar has denied the allegations as "unjustified" and "baseless."

According to Monday's ruling by the United Nation's International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UAE must immediately reunite Qatari families affected by the blockade and allow Qatari students to continue their education in the UAE.

The ICJ's provisional order is part of Qatar's lawsuit filed last month, claiming the UAE "enacted and implemented a series of discriminatory measures directed at Qataris based expressly on their national origin," resulting in alleged violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), to which both countries are signatories.

Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt are not signatories of the CERD convention.

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) Health scandals in China have a history of reaching well beyond the country's borders.

After baby formula was found to be tainted with melamine in 2008, affecting tens of thousands of infants, terrified Chinese parents began mass buying milk powder from overseas, swamping shops and causing shortages in Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand

Fears have already been raised in Hong Kong that a still developing scandal over defective vaccines in mainland China could see the city's own inoculation supplies dry up.

Hundreds of thousands of vaccines have been found to be faulty, sparking widespread fury and panic and leading President Xi Jinping to describe the incident as "vile and shocking."

But the concern shared by many parents in the wake of the scandal -- that it might not be isolated to one company, and could be more widespread -- risks turning into a backlash against Xi's government and his key policy of the "Chinese dream."

First mentioned by Xi in November 2012 , the Chinese dream shares many similarities with the American one, namely that every person will be able to get ahead and succeed, along with a recognition that China's economic growth in recent decades has not been equally distributed among the country's population.

It also shares some similarities to the older, mostly unspoken social contract which developed between the ruling Communist Party and the people after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989: don't rock the boat politically and you can share in China's new wealth.

In many ways, the pivot to Xi's "Chinese dream" was a response -- along with a much publicized anti-corruption crackdown -- to a widespread feeling that despite the country's booming economic growth, too many people were being left behind.

The emergence of a new scandal affecting the country's children will again reinforce the perception that corners are being cut to help the rich become even richer, while the working classes are left to deal with poor safety standards and the resulting health impacts.

"This is a country where a thunderstorm can cause a train to crash, a car can make a bridge collapse and drinking milk can lead to kidney stones," one commentator said in 2011 after a deadly transportation accident. "Today's China is a bullet train racing through a thunderstorm -- and we are all passengers onboard."

'How can I trust you?'

At present, much of the anger over the vaccine scandal has been directed at manufacturer Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology.

Five senior executives of the company, including the chairwoman, were taken into custody for questioning by Changchun police this week, who announced they had begun an official criminal investigation into the company.

The fact that the main villain is a private company and not a government agency part explains why the scandal has been covered in the Chinese press, escaping the type of heavy internet censorship other issues often attract.

Xi's comments and similar ones by Premier Li Keqiang have also seen the government try to get ahead of the public criticism.

But inevitably questions will be asked about the role of the public watchdog -- the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- in all of this, as well as why an investigation was reportedly launched into the company in October, but vaccines not pulled until this month.

"My home country, how can I trust you? You just let me down again and again," one user commented on social media.

One mother, surnamed Zhen from Baoding, Hebei province, told CNN it "will be really hard to rebuild people's confidence in our national brands" after the latest scandal.

In an editorial Monday , the state-run China Daily said "the investigation that has been launched must get to the bottom of the case so as to scratch the bone to get rid of the poison."

"Not just the culprits directly responsible for the problematic vaccines, but also those responsible for enabling the sector's misdeeds need to be caught," it added. "Profits must never come before lives."

The righteous anger of state media and top officials will come as small comfort to concerned parents, who have for years worried about just this sort of revelation, after the 2008 milk powder crisis and previous vaccine scandals did not result in comprehensive reform.

Often, many of those most heavily punished in such events are those who attempted to expose the scandals or were affected by them.

Zhao Lianhai, who advocated on behalf of families affected by the 2008 scandal, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison in 2010 for "disturbing social order." Other activists and parents have also been harassed and detained by the authorities, and had their attempts to gain compensation stymied

According to Human Rights Watch , two lawyers -- Tang Jingling and Yu Wensheng -- who represented parents in vaccine scandals dating to 2006 and 2009 are both still in prison after being jailed for "subversion."

Family members have also been jailed, the rights group said, while journalists who attempted to expose scandals have been removed from their positions.

"Amid the current scandal, while netizens are free to condemn the drug company, news articles and social media posts that showed the Chinese government in a critical light continue to be censored," HRW said in a statement.
__label__world CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals , a year-long series.

Kampala, Uganda — At a party in a private home in central Kampala, there was a moment early in the evening when the rose-lit room felt like a feminist utopia -- a rarity in Uganda.

Women drank hibiscus cocktails and danced happily with each other as a female DJ played a set.

"We're telling women that this space is for you, kind of turning the idea of ladies night on its head," Kampire Bahana (DJ Kampire), known for her all-African, bass heavy music, told CNN.

She's among a handful of female DJs working to create safe spaces for women and the LGBTQ+ community in Uganda, where violence against women continues to be rife. Half of women have experienced physical violence in the country, while 22% have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2018 report from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics

Kampire, who organized the evening with other women, including Rachael Kungu (DJ Rachael), says their aim is to eliminate sexual harassment and demand accountability.

The country has a conservative outlook -- influenced by a mix of colonial-era laws, evangelical Christianity and traditional beliefs. In 2014, two controversial laws made international headlines. The Anti-Homosexuality Act created a surge in hate crime against LGBTQ+ people, and the Anti-Pornography Act , which included a "mini-skirt ban," led to police and vigilantes stripping women in the streets.

Driving through Kabalagala, the heart of Kampala's nightlife scene.

Activists say that these laws have created a fertile environment for crimes against women to be committed. Since 2017, the bodies of more than 20 women have been found dumped on roadsides in greater Kampala.

The government and police have been accused of being slow to respond to the spate of murders -- leading to a series of protests in June , including a women's march and procession carrying mock coffins to the country's parliament building.

But local activists have accused Museveni of blaming female victims of night-time violence. Speaking about the murder of one woman in February, Museveni suggested that young people should avoid alcohol and drugs: "I will not allow anybody to interfere with the freedom of our young people: discos etc. ... but avoid alcohol, drugs and umalaya [sex work]. They are dangerous for you .

Industry veteran DJ Rachael disagrees.

Dubbed East Africa's first female DJ , Rachael has been filling dancefloors with big sounds for over 20 years.

"It's degrading for the government to blame women for being out at night," she told CNN, peering out beneath her signature baseball cap.

DJs Rachael (left) and Kampire (right) playing at Femme Famous, an event organized by Rachael featuring female DJs who she's mentored.

"Some women are out having fun, others are working -- DJs like me, musicians, hotel workers -- we all have to go home late in the night."

Rachael mentors young women interested in mixing, and says she wants to share her expertise with more underprivileged women too: "There are some women in a camp nearby from war-torn areas in Northern Uganda who I want to encourage to take this up."

Kampire was also partly taught by DJ Rachael as part of her Femme Electronic DJ collective.

"It's good to have somebody who has already broken those barriers, it makes entry for other people easier," Kampire said.

"I want to see more women everywhere ... making money, being business owners, running things," she added.

DJ Hibotep playing at Design Hub Kampala, an event and co-working space in an industrial area of the city.

Somalia-born Hibo Elmi, who plays under the moniker Hibotep, a regular behind Kampala's DJ booths, is working toward the same goal.

After being told by a producer that she had to sleep with men or be rich to get studio time, she set her sights on a recording studio of her own: run for women, by women.

Hibotep says she's hyper aware of how surprising she is to people as a female Muslim DJ. On stage, her face is punctuated by bright lipstick and a nose ring, framed by a headscarf. As she plays, videos shown alongside her sets depict "Ninjabis": stereotype-smashing women in burqas, smoking and swearing.

The DJ says she long stopped trying to pander to audiences -- especially men -- instead claiming nightlife spaces around her as her own.

"When you're a woman you get targeted easily," she said, adding that male DJ colleagues have even attempted to sabotage her sets by stepping on wires or pretending to misplace equipment needed for her to play. But she continues to play shows, and to push the boundaries of the male-dominated music scene.

"All us female DJs here play something different," she said. "It's to make a statement. This is our movement and this is how we're gonna shout."

And those "shouts" are beginning to be heard beyond Uganda's borders.

This summer, Kampire has taken her distinct sound global with her first European tour.

Back in Uganda, she is trying to change that landscape, but it's still an uphill battle.

Even after organizing "Pussy Party" Kampala -- a club night with DJ Rachael, curating an all-women and non-binary DJ lineup and security team, and employing a strict door policy -- Kampire's vision for a safe nightlife space isn't quite there yet.

A group of women at the Femme Famous event in Kampala sway to the music.

The same evening that started so well -- with pink cocktails and women on the decks -- ended up unraveling. The organizers lost control of the door policy, and complaints of threatening and abusive behavior from men flooded in.

"It's so challenging trying to create a space which is safe for women and gender minorities, and dealing with straight men's entitlement to women's spaces," Kampire said later in messages on WhatsApp.

"We are still working through the practical aspects of that. But it's a privilege to learn and figure it out, so we're looking forward to the next one."
__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) The Israeli military shot down a Syrian fighter jet after it entered Israeli airspace on Tuesday afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, raising fears of further military escalation in the region.

The Russian-made Sukhoi jet entered two kilometers into Israeli airspace when two Patriot missiles were launched to intercept the aircraft, the IDF said. The missiles hit the jet once it had crossed back into Syrian airspace, the IDF said, adding that the military did not know what happened to the pilot of the aircraft.

Syria said its jet was conducting an operation against "terrorist groups" when it was hit by Israeli fire, according to a state media report.

"The Israeli enemy targeted one of our warplanes while conducting air raids against these groups in the area of Saida on the outskirts of al-Yarmouk Basin in the Syrian airspace," a Syrian state TV banner said, quoting a military source.

Yarmouk basin is one of the last remaining areas in southern Syria not yet under government control. Syrian forces, backed by the Russian military, have been carrying out an extensive campaign in the area in recent days, attempting to wrest control from an ISIS affiliate that is clinging on to a small pocket of territory.

In response, the army says it targeted seven Hamas military posts with tank fire. Palestinian health officials say three Palestinians were killed and one other was critically wounded. The identity of the injured person was not immediately clear.

In a Whatsapp statement sent to journalists, Hamas said the three were members of its armed Qassam Brigades wing.

Health officials named the men as Ahmed Munir Suleiman Al-Bassous, 28, Obaida Asad Khader Farwana, 29, and Mohammed Tawfiq Mohammed Al-Ara'ir, 27. All three died at Malaka, to the east of Gaza City in the north of the Strip.

"As with Uganda, we have deepened our partnership and engagement across the vast expanse of Africa," Modi said during an address to the Ugandan Parliament - the first ever by a serving Indian prime minister. "And we are also opening 18 new embassies in Africa."

Modi also thanked Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni for encouraging Ugandans of south Asian origin to return to the country after their expulsion by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972.

"Your visionary leadership has enabled Ugandan people of Indian origin to return to their cherished home, regain their lives and help rebuild the nation that they deeply love," Modi stated.

He said plans are underway to build a Gandhi Heritage Centre in remembrance of India's independence movement leader Mahatma Gandhi in eastern Uganda, who lived in various African countries for more than two decades.

__label__world (CNN) Somalia will prosecute a female genital mutilation (FGM) case for the first time in the country after a 10-year-old girl died from the procedure last week.

Deeqa Dahir Nuur suffered complications two days after her mother took her to a local cutter in a remote village on July 17, according to media reports.

Her case drew widespread condemnation and anti-FGM groups in Somalia have been calling for justice for Deeqa.

Now the government has announced it will pursue its first FGM prosecution -- even though there is not currently legislation outlawing the practice.

Somalia's deputy prime minister Mahdi Mohamed Guuled said Deeqa's case would send a stern warning that FGM is no longer accepted.

"This is an historic moment for ending FGM in Somalia. This cannot be happening in our country in the 21st century. It is not part of our religion, and it will not be part of our culture," Mohamed Guuled said at a conference organized by Global Media Campaign to End FGM in Mogadishu Wednesday.

One of the doctors who tried to save Deeqa after the botched procedure told CNN she suffered the most extreme form of FGM he had ever seen.

"Her whole female genital tract had been removed, the labia and the clitoris had been cut off, it's type 4 FGM.

"She was brought in two days after they cut her, she was already infected with tetanus," Dr. Abdirahman Omar Hassan said.

"I have never seen this kind of mutilation. And I have treated many bad FGM cases here because it is so common. She was bleeding and convulsing.

"We tried to save her, but she died an hour later."

The country's attorney general said he would prosecute those responsible for Deeqa's death under existing laws.

"We are going to prosecute on this straight away," Attorney General Ahmed Ali Dahir told journalists at the conference.

"Prosecuting this case will not be delayed because we don't yet have a law banning FGM.

"We can do it under the existing penal codes in Somalia," Dahir said.

Dahir added that a team had been sent to the girl's village to investigate her death.

With a 98 percent prevalence, Somalia has the worst FGM rates in the world, according to United Nations statistics.

A 2018 UNICEF report estimates that at least one in four women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM in the country.

The report said around 200 million girls and women in the world are affected. FGM involves the altering or removing of the female genitals, such as the clitoria or labia. FGM can cause severe bleeding and health issues including infections and infertility, as well as complications in childbirth.

The practice is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women, yet it remains widespread in Somalia for religious beliefs, anti-FGM campaigners say.

"FGM can end for women in Somalia if leaders endorse the campaign to end it," said Ifrah Ahmed, who runs women's rights group, Ifrah Foundation.

"What the attorney general said sends a clear message for those cutters and mothers who are practicing FGM in the village or city that it will no longer be tolerated."

Brendan Wynne of Donor Direct Action of Donor Direct Action, an organization which runs a fund for frontline anti-FGM groups, welcomed the news.

"We hope a prosecution can happen to send a signal that this extreme form of violence will no longer be tolerated. Somali girls are literally dying because of FGM," Wynne told CNN in an emailed statement.
__label__world (CNN) About 150 people were injured Thursday after migrants -- some wielding electric saws, shears and mallets -- stormed a border fence to enter Spain's northern African enclave of Ceuta from Morocco, Spanish police and the Red Cross said.

Some 800 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa clashed with the Guardia Civil at 6:35 a.m. Some also employed aerosols as flame throwers, plastic containers filled with quicklime and excrement, and sticks and stones to keep officers at bay, police said.

Several migrants celebrate in Ceuta after they managed to breach the border fence between Spain and Morocco.

In all, 602 migrants crossed into Ceuta; 586 were placed in a temporary migrant holding center, police said.

Of those injured, 132 were migrants, including 11 who were taken to a local hospital for treatment, the Red Cross tweeted. At least 16 officers were injured, with at least four taken to the hospital, the Red Cross and police said. The agencies reported slightly different tallies for hospitalized migrants and injured and hospitalized officers.

A sub-Saharan African migrant is assisted by Spanish paramedics in Ceuta.

Ceuta, along with the province of Melilla to the east, are Europe's only land borders in Africa. Both enclaves have long been popular transit points for sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the sea at the narrow point south of Spain.

__label__world Mati, Greece (CNN) There are "serious indications of arson" in one of several Greek wildfires that killed more than 80 people this week, authorities said Thursday.

Nikos Toskas, deputy minister for citizen protection, said the belief is based on satellite images and ground inspections by police and fire officials at the scene of a deadly blaze that started in the town of Penteli in east Attica.

More than 15 fires broke out on three fronts in that part of southern Greece on Monday afternoon, according to government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos, who described the challenge to firefighters as unprecedented.

The mayor of the municipality where more than 80 people lost their lives to wildfires has admitted that mistakes were made in the response to the crisis, telling CNN that no evacuation order was given and that the scale of the fire was "underestimated."

Vagelis Bournos, mayor of Rafina-Pikermi, said that although weather conditions including very strong winds had played a major role, human error was partly to blame for the deaths, citing the lack of a warning as well as longer-term problems including poor urban planning and the impact on public services of years of austerity.

"We might have had less victims with a well-organized evacuation plan but when the fire began in the municipality of Penteli there was no evacuation order for the east part (of Attica) because of the direction of the wind," Bournos told CNN in an interview Wednesday, adding: "The fire was underestimated."

But the mayor also defended the decision not to evacuate Mati and the surrounding coastal villages, where hundreds of homes were gutted in the blaze that tore through the area Monday.

"Citizens do not follow evacuation plans but they stay behind to protect their households," he said.

"Of course there is anger due to the fact that there are victims. But the same people who are angry now, when the evacuation order would have been issued, they would have stayed back and tried to protect their houses. So victims would still be there, a smaller number, but still."

A number of bodies were found in cars and close to the sea, however, suggesting that many residents did attempt to flee. Hundreds more made it to the beaches and rocky coastline, some waiting in the sea for hours before being rescued.

Demetres Karavellas, director general of WWF Greece, which has warned for years of the deadly threat posed by wildfires and often advises local authorities on how to regenerate areas after fires, described the mayor's reasoning as "a lame excuse."

"People were trying to leave, people were trying to get out," he told CNN on Thursday.

Bournos admitted that there was a window of time in which an evacuation order could have been issued, but it was missed. By the time the blaze was close to Mati, "practically, there could not have been an evacuation," he said. "The decision would have had to have been made a couple of hours earlier."

"We could have made better decisions for sure," he said.

'An accident waiting to happen'

Bournos' admissions also suggest a lack of coordination in the response, which Karavellas said is a chronic problem across Greece.

"Coordination has always been an issue," he said. "We saw this in the wildfires of 2007 which was the last fire that had such a high death toll. Back then, we saw the same situation we see now -- a problem of coordination when the fire breaks out: no evacuation plan in place and nobody centrally coordinating."

A Mati resident who did not want to be named out of fear he would get in trouble with the local authorities told CNN on Wednesday that locals had been requesting preparedness plans for wildfires for several years to no avail. "This was an accident waiting to happen," he said.

Bournos confirmed that residents had made such requests and said that plans had been produced by local volunteer firefighting organizations, but only for smaller-scale scenarios.

Fires across Greece caused dozens of deaths in 2007. Demetres Karavellas says that few lessons were learned from that disaster.

Escape routes blocked

The geography of Mati and the surrounding area is also emerging as a key factor in the high death toll. Many houses were built haphazardly and with little regulation in forested areas and were therefore extremely vulnerable as fire ripped through the dry woodland, which consisted mostly of highly flammable pine trees.

Added to that, roads in the area are narrow and unsuited for large numbers of cars, according to Bournos.

"We are talking about a densely populated area that was built without any urban planning," Bournos said. "Streets were not designed for such heavy traffic ... four thousand households and their residents tried to use streets that couldn't fit them all in."

Burnt cars are seen in Mati following the wildfire.

Residents spoke of being unable to leave the area by car as the fire approached because of congested roads. Photographs taken later showed streets blocked by abandoned, burned-out cars, some with doors left open, suggesting people who were unable to drive out of Mati had decided to flee on foot instead.

Asked if authorities would be more prepared in the future if a similar fire were to hit the Mati area again, Bournos said, "There is nothing left to be burned now. Nature and houses have been totally destroyed. We are here, committed to rebuilding everything the way it was, but now with infrastructure."

A satellite image of Mati taken in October last year shows how many houses were surrounded by flammable forest.

Lack of firefighting resources

Bournos cited the lack of sufficient firefighting forces as a problem. A second set of fires that broke out almost simultaneously in Kineta, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Mati on Attica's western coast, drew resources, Bournos said, leaving fewer available to fight the flames in eastern areas.

He also blamed the national austerity policies of the last few years, which have resulted in cuts to all public services.

A firefighter works to quell the blaze in Kineta, west of Athens Monday.

But both Bournos and Karavellas cite the unusually extreme weather conditions that contributed to Monday's disaster -- high temperatures, strong westerly winds (a rare phenomenon in the region) and a dry winter that created tinderbox conditions.

As the global climate continues to change, this type of fire will become more likely, Karavellas warned.
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Escalating conflict between herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria is "six times deadlier" than Boko Haram-related attacks this year, posing a great threat to the country's stability, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said in a report.

As many as 1,300 Nigerians have died since January in a wave of violent killings that has swept the country's central states, according to the think-tank, which has documented the death toll arising from conflicts in the country.

Boko Haram f ighters have waged a decade-long war in Nigeria's north using calculated attacks that have killed thousands and displaced millions internally.

But in its report released Thursday, the ICG said the escalating pastoral conflict in Nigeria's Middle Belt -- largely due to land-use disputes -- is worse than attacks this year by Boko Haram, whose fighters have bombed mosques, markets and public places in the northeast.

Roughly 30,000 Nigerians have fled their homes in affected states, the group said, adding that incessant attacks in Nigeria's central region have placed a heavier burden on the military and security agencies, who should be countering the Boko Haram insurgency in the north.

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Across Africa, from the north of the Sahara to the West African coast sit many relics of the continent's early interactions with Europe.

In Ghana, two of the country's most famous spectacles, Elmina Castle and Cape Coast Castle are truly imposing.

But their ancient walls were once home to one of the most tragic and brutal periods in the history of humanity -- the transatlantic slave trade.

The bigger of the two, Elmina Castle, is a white-washed fortress on the coast of the small town of Elmina in what is now modern-day Ghana.

First built in 1482 as a Portuguese trading settlement, the 91,000 sq foot behemoth was one of the principal slave depots in the transatlantic slave trade for more than three centuries.

Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Some of them, like Ivor Bartels, are looking to reconnect with their lost family's heritage and unwittingly, a lot more.

"My mother is Belizean, and I was born in the UK. I'm Afro-Caribbean, British-Caribbean. My name took me to Ghana because I knew there was Bartels here," he say in the halls of the old castle.

"I thought this was an ideal place for me to start my journey; to search for my roots, for my past, and to find out really what happened here within these walls."

'A dark history'

Alex Afful, a tour guide at the castle, says there are two schools of thought on the inspiration behind the castle's name.

"One believed that the word 'Elmina' is an Arabic name, which means 'harbor.' One also has it that it's a Portuguese word meaning, 'the mine,' Afful says.

When the Portuguese first arrived, their main commodity was gold, Afful explains.

"At the rate they were getting it, this made the Portuguese to think or believe that a gold mine is found here," he says.

However, when European powers began to invade Africa for slaves, Elmina became an essential stop on the slave route and a prison of sorts for captives.

Today, Afful retraces the brutal journey that most captives faced before being sold into slavery.

It often began by determining which prisoners were healthy enough for the long, arduous course ahead.

"Normally they want the healthy captives, so first they have to count. They have an instrument that they use to open their teeth, to count the number of teeth that they had," Afful explains.

"In some cases, they have to be whipped for them to jump, for them to see how strong that they are. So, that's the first phase. Now, when they get in here, day after that has been done, they were then put in the various dungeons."

JUST WATCHED Cape Coast Castle - From gold trade to slave trade Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cape Coast Castle - From gold trade to slave trade 07:05

After being tested, the captives were confined to Elmina's dungeons where conditions were shocking, even by the standards of the time.

"...There were no toilets. There were no bathrooms. In some cases, they had straws on the floor, which they used as a mattress and so on," Afful describes.

"In all these dungeons, they were given buckets, which they were expected to ease themselves."

"But because of the conditions they were in, the chains they had on their feet made it almost impossible for them to get to this bucket," he tells CNN.

Captives could spend as long as three months in confinement, awaiting their journey into a dark, and unknown future.

As Afful explains, negotiations were concluded before slave ships would carry their human cargo.

But in a market where the seller had little control over how each slave could be distinguished, the buyers often felt the need to label their new property, in the most inhumane of ways.

"Now, with the branding, each merchant has its own method of doing it. Some will use alphabet; some will use numbers on the form of a metallic stamp," Afful describes.

"They put it in the fire, already they have some oil on their body (to) prepare them for the journey. So they burn them on the skin,"

Branded and subjugated, the captives were led aboard awaiting ships through the Door of No Return.

"... when the ship came, they took them in batches through the 'Door of No Return,' and they get to the ship, for the journey to proceed from there," he says.

The 'Door of No Return' still swings, centuries after, a menacing reminder of the captives' descent into a life of terror and relentless servitude.

"Initially, this door was bigger. But when the slave trade began, it was reduced this way. So that one person can come in at a time," Afful says.

The Door, the dungeons where captives were restrained and the walls through which these slaves walked all serve as cues of a story that Africa seems to have confined to the past.

It is an approach that Edmund Abaka, Associate Producer of History and International Studies at the University of Miami, believes we must rethink.

"We have to move away from the perception that, 'oh, history is about the past, history is about people who are dead and gone,'" Abaka says.

"It is our story. If we don't tell our story, somebody will tell their story," he adds.

For Bartels, the accounts of Elmina's past revive a traumatizing story, yet the necessity of hearing these tales is not lost on him.

"I can hear the wailing of my ancestors here. The souls that have been lost. ... But it's good to be home," he says.

Today, the town of Elmina is a lively, bustling hub -- but the castle towers above it, an essential, yet painful reminder of its past.
__label__world Kampala, Uganda (CNN) A Ugandan constitutional court ruling that upholds a constitutional amendment to remove the presidential age limit will likely allow President Yoweri Museveni to extend his 32-year iron grip on power.

In December, the country's parliament amended the constitution, removing the article that limited anyone from serving as president past the age of 75, prompting widespread protests from opposition lawmakers and rights groups.

The constitutional amendment guarantees 73-year-old Museveni a lifetime rule over the country, they said.

Opposition legislators, the Uganda Law Society and civil society groups filed a petition in April asking the court to nullify the bill.

But Alphonso Owiny-Dollo, who heads the constitutional court, said the panel of judges ruled to uphold the amendment Thursday and said the laws were passed in line with the constitution.
__label__world (CNN) An attempt by two Australian inmates to tunnel out of a prison cell, using toothpaste and toilet paper to conceal their escape, has been foiled by authorities

The two inmates at the Bathurst Correctional Center, an all-male medium-security prison west of Sydney, had planned to escape detection by using toothpaste to glue down toilet paper to conceal any signs of digging.

But a corrections officer noticed the damaged mortar at the back of the cell during a routine search of the cell Thursday, and decided to investigate.

"I noticed near the cell bars at the back of the cell what appeared to be diggings into the concrete, and the mortar had been removed from around the large sandstone block," the officer said in a statement by the New South Wales (NSW) Justice Department on Thursday

"A flag shape had also been painted onto the sandstone block to disguise the damage," she added.

__label__world Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) Voting is under way in Cambodia's general election. Officially, there are 20 different political parties on Sunday's ballot. But for many voters in this small Southeast Asian nation, there is no real choice.

The election, the country's sixth since democracy was restored in 1993, has been condemned as a "sham" by rights groups, following the dissolution of the main opposition party and a crackdown on the press by the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP).

In areas away from the capital, voters spoke of a variety of intimidation tactics deployed by the CPP.

"Some people are afraid of talking politics," said one man, who asked to be identified only by his nickname, Bo. According to Bo, the CPP, which under Prime Minister Hun Sen has governed the country for 33 years, punishes those who vote for the opposition.

In rural Cambodia, the village chief and commune counselors issue documents for everything from marriages to land purchases, making people like Bo reliant on them for simple everyday transactions.

Inside the Cambodian People's Party office in Traing district, Takeo province. The single staffer on duty did not want to be photographed.

If they know someone supports the opposition "you have to go (back) three or four times before they agree (to issue the documents)," Bo told CNN from his village home in Traing District, Takeo Province.

"They put pressure on your family and if you are a powerful man they can kill you too, like Kem Ley."

Since Ley's killing, the government has arrested opposition leader Kem Sokha for treason and pro-government courts dissolved his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) soon after.

The authorities also launched a series of ongoing attacks on the press, arresting several journalists and closing the Cambodia Daily newspaper over a tax dispute.

In May, staff at the English-language newspaper the Phnom Penh Post resigned en mass following the sale of the paper to a Malaysian tycoon who demanded changes to an article detailing his links with Prime Minister Hun Sen.

Since 2017, Cambodia has dropped 10 places in the World Press Freedom Index.

Biggest opposition party

The CNRP was the country's biggest opposition party and won 3 million votes, around 44% of the total, during the last general elections in 2013. They accused the ruling party of cheating and the country was rocked by massive protests.

This year, however, Freedom Square, the traditional rallying point of the opposition, has been fenced off and renamed Exchange Square. Only the CPP has held large rallies in the capital. In the days leading up to the ballot, opposition party cars could be seen trundling through the streets of Phnom Penh flanked by a handful of supporters.

The CPP dwarfs the 19 competing parties, eight of which have only been formed in the last 18 months.

With members of the CNRP banned from involvement in politics for five years, and smaller parties unlikely to command much of the vote, the path to victory has been set for Prime Minister Hun Sen.

That win is likely to be bolstered by efforts to dissuade voters like Bo from voting for anyone other than the ruling party.

Sam Rainsy, who led the CNRP's campaign in 2013, has been living in exile in France to avoid imprisonment for defamation -- a conviction he says is politically motivated.

"This sham election is intended to legitimize Hun Sen's killing of democracy in Cambodia with his arbitrary dissolution of the CNRP as the only credible opposition party. With no real challenger Hun Sen's victory is a hollow and laughable one," Rainsy said Friday.

Members of the ruling party rubbish Rainsy's assessment. In the country's capital the spokesman for the party's cabinet, Phay Siphan, told CNN that the new parties had a fair chance to promote their "new ideas."

When asked about Bo's case, he said that any intimidation by CPP officials was "illegal" and should be stopped.

CPP support base

Supporters of the CPP say the party brought Cambodia together after the Khmer Rouge genocide and two decades of civil war. They also point to the country's burgeoning economy.

Venerable Sareun, head monk at Baray Pagoda in Takeo, agrees. "The CPP helped us rebuild after the war," he said, counting the first of three reasons he supports the party. "They are keeping the peace in the country and they are developing Cambodia with new roads and buildings."

The CPP has indeed presided over high growth in recent years. "Robust economic growth averaging 7.6% per year in the past two decades has transformed Cambodia from one of the world's poorest countries to a lower middle-income country today," Sodeth Ly, an economist at the World Bank, wrote in 2016.

But critics say that wealth is not evenly distributed.

According to human rights watchdog Global Witness , most of the wealth has flowed to Prime Minister Hun Sen and his close-knit circle of supporters. In a July 20 report the organization claimed a business elite backed by Hun Sen are "set to profit from the sham poll."

As pillars of Hun Sen's regime, this small cohort of business people and politicians have enjoyed impunity and the chance to pillage state assets, the report alleged.

"This includes senators whose companies are accused of some of the most violent land grabbing Cambodia has seen this century, large-scale timber smuggling, a massive sand dredging scandal, and marijuana trafficking," it said.

While the government has not yet responded to the most recent allegations, Hun Sen's daughter and sons have previously criticized Global Witness and dismissed a similar report in 2016 as "lies and deceit."

Cambodian-American author and academic Sophal Ear said that Cambodia has descended into dictatorship.

"What's happening in Cambodia is the equivalent of Trump arranging for the Supreme Court of the United States to dissolve the Democratic Party for treason and then holding an election in 2020 with the Republican Party and 19 small parties that have no chance of beating the GOP," he said via email.

"Trump would then have arranged for the shuttering of the New York Times on bogus tax evasion charges and arranged the forced sale of the Washington Post to Rupert Murdoch of Fox News, resulting in only pro-Trump news everywhere."

In his village, Bo rocked back and forth on his wooden bench as he considered it all. "I feel upset because in a democracy we need to have an opposition party, especially one strong enough to compete with the ruling party, but (now) there is only one party," he said.

"I heard there are a lot of parties that have joined this mandate but I don't have any information about them ... there is only one CPP."
__label__world Story highlights This blood moon was the longest total lunar eclipse of the century

Mars was its brightest Friday and will be closest to Earth on Monday and Tuesday

(CNN) The longest total lunar eclipse of the century concluded Friday night, showcasing a blood moon for most of the Eastern Hemisphere. Coincidentally, Mars was also at its brightest, putting two bright red objects in the sky.

It began in Australia and Indonesia, and it moved across the globe. The lunar eclipse ended around 7:30 p.m. ET. The totality of the lunar eclipse lasted about an hour and 43 minutes, but the partial eclipse before and after the total phase meant the moon spent nearly four hours crossing the Earth's shadow.

The lunar eclipse happened during daylight hours for those in the Western Hemisphere, so people in North America missed it.

Lunar eclipses can occur only during a full moon, and this one was extra special because it was also the blood moon. The moon was in perfect alignment with the sun and Earth on Friday, with the moon on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.

As the full moon moved into Earth's shadow, it darkened, but it didn't disappear. Sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere lit the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red.
__label__world London (CNN) Julian Assange walked into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, 2012 to claim political asylum. He has been there ever since -- a total of 2,230 days -- rarely seeing daylight. But multiple sources say his situation is now untenable and he may soon leave, whether he wants to or not.

The question is: what will happen to Assange as and when he does walk out of his bolt-hole around the corner from Harrods?

According to the indictment document, "The conspirators (...) discussed the release of the stolen documents and the timing of those releases with Organisation 1 to heighten their impact."

Julian Assange speaks to the media from the balcony of the Embassy Of Ecuador, where he has been living since June 19, 2012.

CNN has established that Organization 1 is WikiLeaks, which published the emails in July 2016.

Assange has always maintained that he did not receive them from the Russian government. He told Fox News in January 2017 : "Our source is not the Russian government, and it is not a state party."

A member of Assange's legal team, Jennifer Robinson, told CNN this week: "WikiLeaks has made very clear they were not engaged in any way with the Russian state with respect to that publication. There is no connection between WikiLeaks and any of those who have been indicted."

His lawyers argue that all Assange did was publish the hacked emails, as did other media, after being in contact with a hacker called Guccifer 2.0. The Special Counsel alleges that Guccifer 2.0 was a cover for Russian intelligence, saying in the indictment that on July 14th [2016], Guccifer 2.0 sent WikiLeaks an encrypted attachment that contained "instructions on how to access an online archive of stolen DNC documents."

Whether a sealed indictment awaits Assange in relation to the Russian hacking investigation is unknown. But according to US officials, charges have been drawn up relating to previous WikiLeaks disclosures of classified US documents

Assange would face arrest if/when he leaves the embassy because he skipped bail in 2012 -- when Swedish authorities were seeking his extradition to face accusations of rape. Last year Sweden suspended the investigation, but Assange's lawyers fear his arrest would be swiftly followed by a US extradition request. Assange maintains his innocence.

"For us protecting him from US extradition is absolutely paramount, and the most important and fundamental principle that must be respected," Robinson told CNN this week.

"There should never be a situation where a publisher is sent to the US to face prosecution for that activity, so we will, if forced, fight his extradition in the British Courts."

The Ecuadorean government wants the case resolved. Ecuador's recently elected president, Lenín Moreno said in Madrid Friday that his government was in dialogue with the UK and wanted a solution that guaranteed Assange's life would not be in danger. He described Assange's long confinement as "against human rights."

Downing Street confirmed discussions were "ongoing."

Moreno has previously described Assange as an "inherited problem" (his predecessor Rafael Correa granted Assange asylum.) But in a statement last week, the Ecuadorean Foreign Ministry said it saw no immediate or long-term solution to the situation.

Hide Caption 17 of 18 Photos: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange Assange speaks to the media in May 2017, after Swedish prosecutors had dropped their investigation of rape allegations against Assange. But Assange acknowledged he is unlikely to walk out of the embassy any time soon. "The UK has said it will arrest me regardless," he said. "The US CIA Director (Mike) Pompeo and the US attorney general have said that I and other WikiLeaks staff have no ... First Amendment rights, that my arrest and the arrest (of) my other staff is a priority. That is not acceptable." Hide Caption 18 of 18

Complicating the situation is the fact that Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship last December.

Assange's situation is also a dilemma for the British government, aware that he inspires both passionate support and visceral animosity.

Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan told the House of Commons last month: "We would like the assurance that if he were to step out of the embassy he will be treated humanely and properly. The first priority would be to look after his health, which we think is deteriorating."

On that issue, Assange's lawyers and Ecuadorean officials agree. Robinson says "the situation is untenable. His health is being irreparably damaged...This case cannot go on much longer."

Assange's isolation deepened in March. His access to the internet and phone was cut off -- in part because Ecuadorean officials said he had violated an agreement not to comment about the internal affairs of other countries. Assange has been, for example, a vocal supporter of the Catalan independence campaign in Spain.

The former consul at the embassy, Fidel Narvaez, says he saw Assange two weeks ago. "He is a very strong man but remember he lives in a small flat, without natural light, just with artificial light," Narvaez told CNN.

Narvaez doesn't believe Assange is about to give up. "He is made for a big fight and I think he faces difficult and adverse situations with strength."

He also maintains that Assange has the right to live in Ecuador, if the British government allows him to leave the country.

On their own admission, Assange's legal team are in the dark about any negotiations that might be going on about Assange's future.

The irony is that Assange fears extradition to a country whose President proclaimed himself a big fan of WikiLeaks when running for office. Donald Trump mentioned WikiLeak's hacking of Hillary Clinton's emails more than 100 times in the last month of the 2016 election campaign. At one point he said: "I'll tell you this Wikileaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart, you gotta read it."

He even went so far as to say: " I love WikiLeaks ."

Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and the US Justice Department appear to think very differently. They believe Julian Assange should be brought in front of a US court. When he was Director of the CIA, Pompeo said: " We can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.

Pompeo said that WikiLeaks "walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service."

Whether Robert Mueller's team agrees -- that's the tantalizing question.
__label__world (CNN) Protesters packed part of Moscow on Saturday to protest a bill that would raise Russia's retirement ages to 65 years for men and 63 for women.

Demonstrators with banners and signs rallied in the city center after the country's Communist Party got permission from the mayor's office for the protest, state media outlet RIA Novosti reported.

The Duma, or lower legislative house, passed the measure in a first reading earlier this month. The upper house has yet to consider it.

The current retirement ages are 60 for men and 55 for women. The government has cast raising the retirement ages as necessary to keep pension funds solvent because the proportion of retirees is rising.
__label__world (CNN) Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is warning that a backlash against immigration in the European Parliament's elections next year will likely bring a shift toward illiberal "Christian democracy."

Orban, who won a third consecutive term in power this year, has locked horns with EU leaders in recent years over his country's hardline immigration policies and for clamping down on democratic institutions -- including civic organizations, the media and academic institutions -- as he consolidated his power.

He has also openly criticized the EU's sanctions against Russia over Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and has met regularly with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Orban has long touted his vision of a right-wing conservative "illiberal democracy" to Hungarians as an alternative to the political models seen in western Europe.

__label__world (CNN) Fourteen people have died after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the popular tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia Sunday, damaging more than 1,000 homes and sending residents fleeing for safety.

The earthquake hit early in the morning, at about 5.45 a.m. local time (6:45 p.m. Saturday ET), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, at a shallow depth of just 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles).

Speaking to CNN, the owner of a hotel in West Lombok said Sunday's quake was the strongest he had experienced on the island.

__label__world He won't thank anyone for pointing it out, but his brand of hard-nosed nationalist populism smacks of President Trump, notwithstanding the fact that Khan's been at politics way longer, a couple of decades at least.

I've seen some of it close up, having followed him on the campaign trail during the country's recent elections.

We flew together on a flimsy helicopter in to the infamous "Swat Valley" in the Hindu Kush mountains into what a few years earlier had been the Pakistani Taliban's heartland.

The town was close to where Nobel laureate, then-schoolgirl Malala Yousefzai was shot in the head by the radical extremist Taliban trying to stifle her calls for democracy and equality.

Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan gestures as he leads a protest march to Islamabad against the country's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led government in Wazirabad in eastern Punjab province on August 15, 2014.

As we got out of the helicopter, Khan quickly jumped in an armored car, we took off at speed, dozens of gun-toting security men crammed onto flat-bed trucks barreling down the road with us.

When we arrived Khan got a rock star welcome: crowds, men and women, young and old going wild waiting to hear from him.

He commanded a huge crowd with ease, his anti-American, anti-Pakistani political establishment message connecting with the tribal, deeply conservative society crammed in to the sport stadium decked out in his party colors: green, red and black.

It was 2013. Bathing in adoration appeared to come naturally to him.

As Trump does today, I saw Khan invigorated by the crowd, pumping them up for victory as they inflated his ego, lifting him towards his goal.

But like the wind-ripped rocky helicopter ride into the remote region that day, his ambitions in the 2013 election were buffeted off course.

He was closing in on the leadership job he craved, could taste victory, enough to mount a four-month challenge accusing the establishment of cheating, rigging voting and the results.

Mega-star legend

It was another sports stadium, another era in Khan's life where his journey on the path to be Prime Minister was really cemented.

In 1992, at the end of a stellar career as one of the most gifted cricketers of his generation, he led Pakistan's national squad to world cup victory, the crowds rose for him as they had for more than two decades.

Pakistan cricket star turned politician Imran Khan gestures as he stands on a vehicle during a rally in Mianwali, northern Pakistan, on October 6, 2012.

He was a mega-star legend, lived in London, grew a reputation as a playboy, and became a regular at many of the city's most glamorous nightspots, before joining British high society with his marriage to heiress Jemima Goldsmith.

Fame was his constant shadow; today he eschews the gilded good life he had back then for the principles of his conservative Islamic upbringing. But it was undoubtedly his cricketing poster boy popularity that was his passport into politics.

Like Trump he was born into privilege, and like the US President has never held political office.

His leadership is going to be anyone's guess.

Military: The real power behind Khan?

What won him votes, was an anti-corruption ticket, aiming to take down Pakistan's dueling rival political dynasties, coupled with his long-running anti-US rhetoric.

He has blasted Trump's Afghan policy which accuses Pakistan of not doing enough to fight terrorism, and for more than a decade Khan has escalated anti-US sentiment along the Afghan/Pakistan border, criticized US drone strikes and whipped up lethal fervor over alleged US misdeeds in Afghanistan.

In this election cycle his followers have swelled beyond the cadres of young religiously conservative men he's gathered in the past. Now they include voters simply wanting a change from the stultifying self-serving politicians of Pakistan's two dynastic powerhouses who are widely blamed for having driven the country into an economic hole.

JUST WATCHED Khan addresses voters after claiming victory Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Khan addresses voters after claiming victory 01:03

Pakistan's powerful army has been blamed by many journalists for intimidation in the months leading up to the election, particularly of critics of Khan. But the military has never been far from power, has engineered several coups in the country's short seven-decade history, and has a disproportionately large number of business interests inside Pakistan.

In short, Khan won't be his own man. No amount of Khan's popularity will sway them from their core interests, the survival of Pakistan.

The military believes India is an existential threat to their Muslim nation carved out of the bloody collapse of the British Raj.

The two nuclear-armed nations still face off high in the Himalayas on the Siachen glacier, at 21,000 feet above sea level it is the world's highest battlefield, but it is over Pakistan's western border in Afghanistan that today's battles are mostly waged.

Taliban key to Khan's success

In the early 1990s Pakistan's intelligence services backed Afghanistan's Taliban to take complete control of Afghanistan, to give the slender north-south Pakistan "strategic depth" westwards.

Trump's Afghan strategy calls for India to do more in Kabul, a red rag to Pakistan's military, and so where Trump might find common cause with Khan may be with the Taliban.

JUST WATCHED Two perspectives on cricket hero's Pakistan victory Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Two perspectives on cricket hero's Pakistan victory 12:46

The US President needs the group to stop fighting and join the Afghan government so he can pull out US troops. Khan, an ethnic Pashtun like many Taliban, has built up his support among Pakistani Taliban loyalists, which could be a conduit to negotiations with the Taliban.

To align all of that will require more than the public threats by Trump to cooperate or else, and will likely need much more than is in Khan's grasp to give -- or for that matter the military's will to offer.

In the short term Khan is going to be consumed by forming a government, tackling a crooked and crumbling economy, dealing with creditors like China, and fighting off allegations of a rigged election from the Pakistan's Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League -- the same two dynasties he's been fighting for decades, the same people he led street protests against claiming the same wrongdoing in 2013.

To borrow from his cricketing legacy, he is going to have to hit a few boundaries before he can turn to Trump's demands, and by all accounts he'll need the military's help to do it.
__label__world Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) Former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe said Sunday he will not vote for his old party, Zanu-PF, in a surprise news conference on the eve of the presidential election.

"I can't vote for Zanu-PF. I can't vote for the people who have brought me into this state," said the 94 year old who ruled Zimbabwe for almost four decades before resigning in November amid the threat of a military takeover and impeachment.

"I must say clearly I cannot vote for those who have tormented me. I can't. I will make my case among the other 22 [out of the 23 candidates]," said a frail-looking Mugabe in a rare public appearance from his mansion in the capital Harare.

The former president, slouched in his chair and often mumbling during the almost two-hour long event, said Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance would instead get his vote in Zimbabwe's first general election since his resignation last year.

Mugabe added that had not met Chamisa. "I met his late leader [Morgan] Tsvangirai, we worked together at that time. But him and any other persons in his alliance, I have not met. Definitely not. I wish to meet him if he wins," he told reporters.

__label__world Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) Police fired tear gas Sunday at demonstrators in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, where tens of thousands had gathered to mourn a national hero.

The unrest occurred at a state funeral for Simegnew Bekele, lead engineer on the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project , who was found slumped at the wheel of his car Thursday with a gunshot wound to his head.

Bekele's body arrived in the city's Meskel Square about 11 a.m. local time in a hearse adorned with garlands, followed by about 50 white cars. Witnesses told CNN that some members of the crowd became angry after they were prevented from following Bekele's coffin to the church where he was to be laid to rest.

The scene at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa during a state funeral for Semegnew Bekele.

"For about 20 minutes, they were chanting that this government is not yet democratic," said Bisrat Teshome, 35, an economist who was at the square.

Several protesters then attempted to climb a pole and replace the current Ethiopian flag, which bears a star, with an older version without the emblem, in an act of political defiance.

The star is a symbol of diversity and unity, but there has long been public annoyance that it was added to the flag without proper consultation, Teshome said.

"They (the police) started throwing tear gas in between people. Then everyone ran away. It was the first time I had seen tear gas," Teshome said.

A handful of people were rushed to a hospital after being sprayed with tear gas, witnesses told CNN.

When CNN contacted police to ask about the tear gas, an unidentified spokesman declined to comment and hung up the phone. Follow-up attempts to obtain a comment from Ethiopia police have so far been unsuccessful.

Tens of thousands of Ethiopians gathered for Bekele's funeral at Meskel Square -- the same place where his body was found three days earlier in what is widely believed to be an assassination.

Shouts could be heard across the capital as those gathered called for a proper investigation into Bekele's death.

Security for the state funeral was extremely tight, with roads around the square closed and armed soldiers lining the streets.

A popular figure

Bekele was a hugely popular figure who had become synonymous with the nation's ambitious flagship dam project, a source of national pride.

"This guy had been the hope of Ethiopians," said Abel Wabella, 31, managing editor of the Gobena Street news site, who was at the funeral. "He had been telling people about this mega-project for seven years. Everybody knew who he was."

A huge brass band led Bekele's coffin through the city to Holy Trinity Church, where he was to be buried alongside Emperor Haile Selassie I, the late prime minister Meles Zenawi and British suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst.

In a country splintered by tribal politics, Bekele's funeral was a uniting factor that crossed ethnic lines.

"All the ethnic groups in Ethiopia are saddened and angered by what happened to him," said Wabella. "The people here are not Amhara (Bekele's tribal group)."

Simegnew Bekele's funeral procession passes the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Addis Ababa.

A time of revolutionary change

Ethiopia has undergone a period of unprecedented change since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in April.

This is the third time the public has rallied en masse at Meskel Square during Abiy's tenure as the nation's leader.

In just over three months, Abiy has released thousands of political prisoners, ended the state of war with Eritrea, pledged to open up the economy and, just this weekend, visited Ethiopian immigrants in Washington, DC, to ask them to return to help build the country's democratic future.

But while there is currently a surge of optimism in Ethiopia, there is also caution.

At a rally attended by Abiy in Meskel Square in June, an explosion killed two people and injured over 150. The day after, citizens organized a massive rally in the same spot to show their support for Abiy's reforms.

Abiy is Ethiopia's first prime minister from the Oromo ethnic group, which makes up about a third of the African nation's 100 million people. His appointment by the country's ruling coalition was seen as a move to calm divisions between the Oromo and other ethnic groups.

The Grand Renaissance Dam

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is one of Africa's most ambitious infrastructure projects, reaffirming Ethiopia's goals of becoming a key regional player and a major exporter of power.

When completed, the dam on the Blue Nile River will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports.

The most striking aspect of the nearly $5 billion enterprise is that it is entirely funded by Ethiopia, without any foreign investment. According to the authorities, 20% of the project is financed from bond offerings to Ethiopians, and the remaining 80% from tax collection.

Belachew Mekuria, head of the Ethiopian Investment Commission, said that everybody in the country felt they had contributed to the dam -- one reason why Bekele's death has rocked the nation so powerfully.

"This project signifies a lot because it means saying no to Ethiopia's characterization as a land of famine, as a land of poor people," he said.

In short, he said, the dam's success would "symbolize" Ethiopia's future.
__label__world (CNN) The United Nations has verified 7,000 cases of children either killed or maimed in Syria's seven-year war, but says unverified reports puts the number "way beyond 20,000."

This year has been particularly woeful for Syria's children as violations against them rise significantly, according to a UN monitoring body, which has verified more than 1,200 such violations, including the deaths or injury of more than 600 children.

"I am deeply disturbed by the stories of children born and raised throughout this conflict, children who have never seen peace in Syria," said Virginia Gamba, the UN's special representative of the secretary-general for children and armed conflict, who addressed the Security Council on Friday.

"Children who have suffered repeatedly of all types of violations in their homes, communities, schools, detention centers and in refugee and IDP settings. We must think that these children are in severe psychosocial distress. They do not know the meaning of the word 'peace.'"

A member of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group carries an injured child after airstrikes in Eastern Ghouta on February 19.

In early 2014, the UN admitted it had stopped officially counting deaths in Syria as it could no longer rely on its own data, with its access to much of the country impeded. It generally puts the death toll of the war at 400,000, but it relies on other monitoring groups' unverified accounts to do so.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump's re-election campaign denied Saturday that it is using Chinese manufacturers to produce campaign flags, despite recent viral images that suggest otherwise.

"We have made it clear all along that all of our merchandise is 100% made in the USA," Michael Glassner, the campaign's chief operating officer, said in a statement to CNN. "Any vendor who claims to have a relationship with us otherwise is lying or violating our protected trademark rights."

"This applies to all of the recent fake news about Made in China products for the 2020 campaign," he said.

Reuters reported this week that Jiahao Flag Co Ltd, a company located in eastern China, has been turning out tens of thousands of red, white and blue "Trump 2020 Keep America Great" banners since March. A company manager told Reuters that she believes the US-China trade war was spurring the larger than normal production numbers in an effort to avoid looming tariff hikes. The manager also said the buyers are located within China and abroad, and she didn't know whether they were affiliated with Trump's official campaign or the Republican Party.

CNN reported earlier this month on an NPR story that said the owner of another factory in a different Chinese province said his company is making flags for Trump's re-election campaign.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed support Sunday for President Donald Trump's enthusiastic pursuit of tariffs on China, saying that so long as tariffs are "targeted," the actions are valid.

Kudlow, whose comments walked back his previous pre-White House characterization of tariffs as a "regressive tax on low-income families," was responding to a question from anchor Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" about whether he agreed with Trump's tweet last week that "Tariffs are the greatest!"

"You know, if they're targeted for good purpose, as per China, I think the answer is absolutely yes," Kudlow answered.

Kudlow further remarked that his support for targeted tariffs has "always" been his view.

"Most free traders agree China has not played by the rules, and the trading system is broken largely because of them," he said.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump threatened Sunday to push the government into a shutdown ahead of the coming spending deadline in September if Congress does not fund his border wall and change the nation's immigration laws.

"I would be willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!" Trump tweeted.

I would be willing to "shut down" government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!

Trump's Twitter threat introduced a fresh wild card for congressional negotiators to deal with as the remaining legislative days tick down before government funding runs out -- an explosive prospect for both parties with just 100 days until the midterm elections. The warning also comes as Trump fac

Trump has previously floated the possibility of a government shutdown over border security and immigration, and on Sunday he made his threat explicit, saying he would do so unless Congress funds his proposed wall, which he promised Mexico would pay for, and puts in place his preferred immigration policies.

In May, Trump suggested "closing up the country for a while" if he did not get his wall.

"They don't want the wall," Trump said. "But we're going to get the wall, even if we have to think about closing up the country for a while."

Sunday's shutdown threat from Trump also echoed a remark he made in February when he said "I'd love to see a shutdown" if the government did not agree to address immigration.

"I said to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again," Trump said in March.

A shutdown over Trump's wall at the September deadline would mark the third lapse in appropriations this year, following a shutdown in January as Democrats battled with the Trump administration and congressional Republicans on protections for "Dreamers" as well as a brief shutdown when Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky blocked a spending vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced in June that he was canceling much of the Senate's August recess, saying the chamber needed the additional time to make progress on Trump's nominees and pass appropriations bills. And with the House out on August recess, there's not much time left before the deadline that both chambers will be in session.

Both Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and McConnell met with Trump last week to discuss funding the government.

Asked about Trump's Twitter threat, a pair of Republican lawmakers said Sunday that they didn't think the government should or would shut down this September.

"Let's hope not," Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said on CBS's "Face the Nation."

Johnson added that he didn't think a shutdown would be "helpful" to Republicans in the November elections, "so let's try and avoid it."

Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said on ABC's "This Week" said he did not think it would come to a shutdown.

"I don't think we're going to shut down the government," Stivers said. "You know, I think we're going to make sure we keep the government open, but we're going to get better policies on immigration."
__label__world Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) A South African High Court has overturned a government decision to grant diplomatic immunity to former Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe over an alleged case of assault, paving the way for prosecution and possible extradition.

Former President Robert Mugabe's wife was accused of assault after an alleged attack on South African model Gabrielle Engels in a Johannesburg hotel room last August.

However, she was granted diplomatic immunity by South Africa's former Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, allowing her to leave the country.

Nkoana-Mashabane said the decision was to maintain good relations with Zimbabwe. The Mugabes were in South Africa to attend a regional leaders' summit in Pretoria.

Engels said Mugabe hit her with an electrical cord in a hotel room in the presence of her sons, an allegation Mugabe denies.

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) More than two million bottles of cough syrup containing codeine are being recalled to stop widespread abuse of the drug, the Nigerian health ministry has said.

The recall is based on recommendations from a recent committee report from anti-drug abuse agencies in the country, Christiana Adeyeye, Director- General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control told CNN Monday.

"We asked all pharmaceutical companies producing codeine-cough syrups to recall the drugs. It was painstaking process that took six weeks but it is part of the steps we are taking to tackle codeine abuse in the country," Adeyeye said.

Codeine, an opioid pain reliever, is the second most commonly abused prescription drug in Nigeria, a 2016 report Nigerian Epidemiological Network on Drug Use found.

Analysis of opioid users in 12 treatment centers in the country showed that 69% had used tramadol, 21% had used codeine and heroin accounted for only 2% of admissions, the survey found.

The drug came under scrutiny last year after Nigeria's Senate claimed around three million bottles of codeine-based cough syrup were consumed daily in two states in the north of the country.

In March, Nigeria's anti-drug agency said its officials had intercepted 24,000 bottles of unregistered cough syrup in a single raid in Katsina, a state in northern Nigeria, local media reported.

Young addicts

Codeine-based cough syrups are commonly abused alongside prescription drugs like tramadol by young Nigerians, according to health officials in Nigeria.

"Even teenagers and young adults are abusing prescription drugs like tramadol, rophynol, codeine-cough syrups. Some are smuggled into the country as unregistered products," Adeyeye said, while calling for stricter punishment for drug smuggling in the country.

Marcus Odiegwu, a 19-year-old student, told CNN he combines several bottles of codeine-based cough syrups with crushed tramadol tablets to get high.

"I had friends that were taking codeine at that time. I saw the aftermath, and I liked it," Odiegwu said. "They will go off and on just like that. So I decided to try it one night, it felt cool, and I continued," he told CNN.

"I can do some crazy things when I am angry, but I don't take things personally when I take codeine. You might offend me, but I am too relaxed to bother," the student added.

Opioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

They bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a "high."

People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop and may need to take higher doses leading to addiction.

Odiegwu told CNN though he knows the health implications of codeine addiction, he is more bothered about its impact on his academics.

"I actually want to stop because I am having issues in school," said Odiegwu who said he was suspended after he was caught using drugs in school.

Nigeria banned the sale of over-the-counter sale of codeine in 2012 because of widespread abuse in the country. But that has not stopped easy access to the drug, according to users like Odiegwu.

"It's easy to get codeine or any drug in this present situation. Whether it is a pharmacy or not, you can get your drugs if you know who is selling them," he said.

"Some people buy in bulk with evidence that they want to use it for legal things or health purpose, but those are the people who sell it around," he added.

Broader link to crime

Glen Prichard is the coordinator for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Nigeria Response to Drugs and Related Organised Crime.

Prichard told CNN Nigeria's law enforcement responses to illicit drugs has improved in recent years.

However, the country remains a target because its population and market size make it an attractive destination for criminal networks trafficking pharmaceuticals in West Africa.

It is not just Nigeria, the UNODC warned illegal trade and growing abuse of synthetic opioids, are destabilizing parts of West Africa, especially in the Sahel region.

Prichard said there are two potentially worrying aspects to the drug issue in West Africa.

First, is the health complications that arise from the abuse of prescription drugs which leads to dependency, another is its potential to undermine national security, especially in countries facing terrorism in the region.

"The effects of drug trafficking contribute to criminalization in society and weakening of institutions which in turn has an effect of stability," Prichard said.

"Drug trafficking is not just of pharmaceuticals, it is also about other illicit substances and that is an issue that Nigeria and the region should be aware of," he added.

The four tourists died after a car struck them in Khatlon Oblast, a region south of Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe. Tajik authorities said three other cyclists in their group were treated for minor injuries. Their nationalities have not been released.

Authorities in Tajikistan investigating the incident are considering "all possibilities," including terrorism and the possibility it was an accident, Umarjonni Emmomali, head of the press department at the Ministry of Tajikistan, told CNN.

Investigators searched the village of Torbulok following the incident and identified a damaged vehicle that showed "involvement in the commission of this crime," according to a statement sent to CNN Sunday from the Tajikistan Interior Ministry.

One suspect was arrested, according to the statement, and "during the resistance" two other suspects were "eliminated." CNN asked the Tajikistan Interior Ministry for clarification on the word "eliminated" but received no response.

__label__world (CNN) Zimbabweans thronged to the polls Monday in what many hope will be something the country has never seen: a free and fair election, without the interference of former leader Robert Mugabe.

The nation's electoral commission said about 70% of registered voters cast their ballot.

The landmark vote has been touted as the first time the African nation held an election without the former strongman in almost four decades, but although Mugabe is not on the ballot, his influence continues to be felt.

The now-disgraced 94-year-old could not resist stepping back into the political arena on the eve of the vote. In his first major political statement since being ousted from office last November, Mugabe said he would not vote for his former party Zanu-PF or current President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

"I can't vote for Zanu-PF. I can't vote for the people who have brought me into this state," Mugabe said during a news conference in the garden of his home in Harare on Sunday.

"I must say clearly I cannot vote for those who have tormented me. I can't," the ailing former revolutionary added. "I will make my case among the other 22 (out of the 23 candidates)."

On Monday afternoon, Mugabe cast his ballot in Highfield, a suburb of Harare.

Robert Mugabe casts his vote in the first election where he is not a candidate.

It is unclear whether or how Mugabe's intervention on Sunday influenced voters. He was forced to resign late last year after nearly four decades in power, following a crisis sparked by his decision to fire Mnangagwa, his then vice-president.

Now, Mnangagwa is President and head of Mugabe's former party, Zanu-PF.

At stake in the landmark presidential election is a chance for Zimbabwe to finally shed its reputation as a pariah state and move to a democracy free from international sanctions.

The country, which suffered crippling hyperinflation under Mugabe, desperately needs the International Monetary Fund to start giving it loans again. It also needs the United States, European Union and others to lift sanctions.

People queue to vote early Monday morning.

But those restrictions will remain in place until a free and fair election takes place. Anything less, and in international eyes at least, it may as well be Mugabe still in power.

"The elections, if free and fair, provide an opportunity to establish a strong opposition presence in Parliament for the first time since 1987 or to even topple Zanu-PF," said Heike Schmidt, associate professor in modern African history at the University of Reading in England.

"What one can say so far is that pre-election violence and intimidation appears to be less than on previous such occasions and that President Mnangagwa appears utterly confident in his election victory."

Voters queue at a polling station in Harare.

'Far from being free'

Whatever Mugabe might have been up to in his months of exile, the target of his return to the political spotlight was clear.

Mugabe accused 75-year-old Mnangagwa, his party and the army of creating an environment for Zimbabweans that is "far from being free."

"I have during that time, during all this time, cried for return -- our return to constitutionality, our return to legality, our return to freedom for our people and environment in which our people will be free -- they have not been free," Mugabe said. "Since that day when tanks rolled through and across the country when there was a takeover by the army."

Mugabe added he wanted the benefits his family was given to be "honored" by those in power and denounced attacks against his family, especially his wife.

"I don't accept the denunciations and vilifications that are going on of my wife every day in the papers for nothing," he said. "Perhaps through her they think by attacking her they are attacking me. Leave, leave, leave my wife alone!"

Zimbabwean opposition leader Nelson Chamisa casts his vote on Monday.

Mnangagwa used Mugabe's intervention to attack his main rival, 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa of Zimbabwe's Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, claiming the former leader had "forged a deal" with the MDC.

"Now that it is clear to all that Chamisa has forged a deal with Mugabe, we can no longer believe that his intentions are to transform Zimbabwe and rebuild our nation," Mnangagwa, who served Mugabe for decades, said in a brief recorded statement on Sunday.

"The choice is clear: You either vote for Mugabe under the guise of Chamisa, or you vote for a new Zimbabwe under my leadership and the Zanu-PF. Real change is coming. We should all be part of it."

Zimbabweans line up to vote at the Fitchela Primary School in Kwekwe on Monday.

Chamisa called Mnangagwa's response "panicky" during a news conference later on Sunday in which he assailed the country's election commission for its role in the elections, saying it was biased in favor of Mnangagwa.

Chamisa took over the leadership of the MDC after the death of its founder and longtime anti-Mugabe activist Morgan Tsvangirai, who died from cancer in February.

There have been few public appearances by Mugabe and his wife, Grace, nicknamed "Gucci Grace" because of her love of luxury, since their fall from power. They have been spending time in Singapore, where he receives medical treatment, and their plush 25-room residence in Harare.

Results of Monday's general election are expected by August 4. The country's constitution requires the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to release results within five days of the polls closing.
__label__world (CNN) More than 600 stranded hikers have been successfully rescued from Mount Rinjani on Indonesia's Lombok Island, two days after a powerful 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the popular tourist destination.

The final six hikers were brought down from the mountain Tuesday morning, confirmed National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, following a massive combined rescue effort involving almost 200 Indonesian police, military and medical personnel.

The hikers had become trapped on the mountain's numerous hiking routes after the earthquake, which struck early Sunday, unleashed a series of landslides blocking their path back down to safety.

Hundreds of foreign hikers were among the 600 rescued from the 3,726 meter (12,224 ft) mountain, said Nugroho.

It is not known whether those rescued from the mountain will require additional medical treatment. Tipatai Phusit, a hiker from Thailand, who was on top of Mount Rinjani when the earthquake hit, tolD CNN said he saw a number of people hit by rocks and debris.

__label__world New Delhi (CNN) Indian authorities have left the names of almost 4 million people off a controversial registry list in the northeast border state of Assam, effectively casting a shadow over their citizenship.

The publication of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) on Monday comes amid popular anger over illegal migration into Assam, which shares a porous border with Bangladesh.

Proponents of the registry say it will help root out illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, but the move has prompted fears of possible deportation among Assam's hundreds of thousands of Bengali-speaking Muslims.

The decision to impose a state-wide register of citizens has drawn parallels with Myanmar's Rakhine State, where Rohingya Muslims have long faced persecution owing to their Bangladeshi ancestry.

Last year, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were forced across the border into Bangladesh as part of a targeted attack labeled by the UN as ethnic cleansing

Tensions over citizenship have been brewing for decades in Assam, resurfacing earlier this year with a government effort to rid the state of "Bengalis" and "foreigners."

Many of the state's Bengali community have lived in India for decades, crossing the border into Assam during the bloody Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) independence struggle in 1971. Many others can trace their history back even further, arriving before the independence of India in 1947.

Assam is the only state in India to have a citizenship register. Villagers in Assam stand in line to check their names on the first draft of NRC earlier this year.

Appeal process

Security has been tightened across the tea-rich state in anticipation of potential anti-immigration violence in the wake of the registry's release.

Out of the state's 32.9 million population, 28.9 million people have been recognized as legal citizens.

Assam is the only state in India to have a citizenship register. It was created in 1951 to identify Indian citizens from illegal migrants from East Pakistan.

The cutoff date to be eligible for Indian citizenship is March 24, 1971, a day before the onset of the Bangladesh Liberation War.

Authorities said that no one will be deported until an appeals process is cleared. Officials have made reassurances that those left out of the list will be able file appeals from August 30 until September 28, 2018.

Anand Sharma, a senior leader of the main opposition Indian National Congress party, said the credibility of the process was questionable.

"This has interstate repercussions, involves humanitarian aspects and our relationship with the neighboring state of Bangladesh," he told reporters Monday.

"Families should not be separated. The government of Assam should hold a meeting with all political parties of the state."

Writing in the Economic and Political Weekly, Sanjoy Hazarika, a human rights activist and Director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, said it was unclear what will happen to those who could find themselves stateless.

"While a number of illegal immigrants may emerge through the NRC, there is no clarity on what happens after identification and prosecution: they cannot be deported for there is no such arrangement between India and Bangladesh. Will they be left in limbo without rights? Many, both Hindus and Muslims have apparently established homes and businesses, schools, farms and factories. Such persons include school and college students," said Hazarika.

"What is the process of handling their cases? Will they be pulled away from their homes and each other? Where will they be detained? These questions need to be answered," added Hazarika, posing questions both the Indian and State governments have yet to address.

Living in limbo

Speaking at a press conference after the launch of the final draft list, Sailesh, the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, attempted to calm fears, suggesting that the State government would begin a period of "claims and objections."

"We'll wait for the finalization of the NRC ... No punitive or penal action will be taken," added Sailesh.

India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh released a statement on Twitter on July 22, saying: "The Citizenship Rules provide that any person who is not satisfied with the outcome of claims and objections can appeal in the Foreigner's Tribunal. Thus, there is no question of anyone being put in a detention center after the publication of NRC."

In 1983, hundreds of people were killed in Assam by mobs intent on driving out Muslim immigrants.

The renewed process to update the list began in 2015 under the supervision of the Supreme Court of India.

Those whose names or the names of their descendants appeared in the NRC 1951 will be included in the final draft, which is expected to be released in December 2018.
__label__world (CNN) Nearly 700 people are trapped on a volcano on the popular Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, after a devastating earthquake killed more than a dozen people.

A rescue operation is currently underway for tourists caught in landslides on Mount Rinjani, an area popular with hiking enthusiasts. According to National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho , 689 people are still trapped on and around the 3,726 meter (12,224 ft) mountain following the shallow 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck Sunday morning.

At least 260 people had already been evacuated by Sunday afternoon, Sutopo said on Twitter, while a spokesman for Rinjani National Park said another 109 had been rescued as of 2 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) Monday afternoon.

A photo shared by Anuwat Kongko, a 28-year-old hiker from Thailand who was on top of Mount Rinjani when the earthquake hit.

According to Indonesia's national disaster management agency, 149 climbers are still believed to be stranded on the volcano itself, while 500 people are trapped in Sembalun Village on the volcano's slopes, and an additional 40 tourists are in nearby Batu Ceper.

At least one climber had died after being struck by falling rocks, Sutopo said.

__label__world (CNN) Malaysian authorities said Monday they have failed to determine the cause of the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370, though they did rule out several possibilities.

Announcing the release of a widely anticipated safety investigation report , investigators acknowledged a lack of any clear evidence on the plane's ultimate fate, but added it would be presumptuous to suggest this was the end of the matter, given the wreckage had not yet been located.

The Malaysia Airlines flight disappeared in 2014 carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, in what has become one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries.

Speaking at a press conference near the capital Kuala Lumpur, lead investigator Kok Soo Chon said MH370 turned back towards Malaysia under manual control, but it could not be determined whether the plane was being flown by the pilot or if there had been any unlawful interference.

Chon went on to rule out other factors that had been questioned in the demise of the flight, including the pilot's mental state, aircraft malfunction, or remote control of operation systems.

Canberra residents have taken to social media with images of the jumping marsupials exploring outside their usual habitats. But beyond the cute photo opportunities, the hungry kangaroos are at risk of dying on the roads as their feeding times coincide with rush hour.

Canberra has more than 30 nature reserves, with most hosting hundreds of Eastern Grey Kangaroos, and it is not unusual to see them in the reserves or in roads or yards nearby, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Parks and Conservation Service Director Daniel Iglesias told CNN.

But he said this winter the animals were far more visible.

"Canberra is experiencing a perfect storm of hardship for its kangaroos. New records have been set in Canberra for very cold, frosty nights this winter. This, coupled with very dry conditions with very little rain at all in June and July, means there is very little food for kangaroos, " Iglesias said, via email.
__label__world (CNN) Russia put on a show of its naval might Sunday, sending 40 warships through waters near St. Petersburg in a display that promises to be strong on optics but one that may mask key weaknesses.

This year's version of the country's annual Navy Day parade was expected to feature the first public appearance of Russia's new stealth frigate, the Admiral Gorshkov. The 4,500-ton warship is the lead ship of six of the type planned to become part of the Russian fleet by 2025, the state-run news agency Tass reported

However, Tass said the Gorshkov and 11 other vessels were too big to sail into the Neva River, where the main part of the parade took place, and that President Vladimir Putin had instead greeted their crews at Kronshtadt, St. Petersburg's seaport, where they anchored in parade formation.

"The Russian fleet successfully resolves the tasks of the country's defense capability, makes a significant contribution to the fight against international terrorism, plays an important role in ensuring strategic parity," Putin said at the parade. "For more than 300 years, the fleet has been defending the status of the Russian Federation as a naval power capable of protecting with determination its national interests."

The Russian president said dozens of ships and submarine supported Russia's interests in the World Ocean every day.

"We are rightfully proud of our navy, our naval forces, their highest level of combat readiness, strategic, tactical and operational capabilities, the strength and beauty of our fleet," he said.

Gorshkov-class frigates

Defense Minister Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu calls the new class of frigates the "mainstay" of the Russian fleet for years to come, according to Tass.

Analysts say Gorshkov-class frigates will be fast and formidable.

"The new frigate is incredibly well armed for such a small warship," analyst Paul Schwartz of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) wrote in a 2016 study of the program , adding the frigate "would add significant combat capability to the fleet."

"It's a significant upgrade over its predecessors," said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, who points out that the new Russian frigates will carry supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles that can find their targets much more quickly than their US counterparts.

That gives the Admiral Gorshkov-class an advantage over the US ships, including the much heavier Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers and the US littoral combat ships, which are of a similar size but more lightly armed than the Gorshkov, said Schuster.

The Admiral Panteleyev Destroyer takes part in a parade marking Russian Navy Day.

Other notable ships in Sunday's parade include the brand-new amphibious assault ship Ivan Gren -- capable of carrying 13 main battle tanks -- the 10,000-ton guided missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov, and the guided-missile submarine Oryol , at 24,000 tons the largest vessel in the parade, according to Tass.

While those ships join three dozen others in the waters off St. Petersburg, noticeably absent will be the country's lone aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov.

The 58,000-ton carrier went in for repairs and refit in May, more than a year after it returned from a mission off Syria that saw it spewing thick black smoke while at sea and also losing two of its 15 aircraft to crashes.

The Russian carrier is not expected to be back on active duty until 2021, Tass reports

Spectators watch the naval parade marking Russian Navy Day.

Schuster said that shows a problem with the Russian navy -- maintenance.

"The Russians typically focus on construction first, operations a distant second, training third and maintenance a very distant fourth," the former US Navy officer said.

"The Kuznetzov needs far more upgrading and maintenance than the Russians have publicly stated they will undertake. It means she will be approaching obsolescence when she departs the yards in 2021," said Schuster, now a professor at Hawaii Pacific University.

Asked about claims from Russia's deputy defense minister this month that Moscow will this year add 19 ships to its fleet of about 280 ships, Schuster was circumspect.

"The Russians count every ship commissioned, including patrol craft and units coming out of shipyard overhaul," he said . "It gives the impression of a major buildup, but only about six of them will be modern warships."

And Russia's shipbuilding has its share of problems. Tass reported in early July that the delivery of the second frigate in the Gorshkov class, the Admiral Kasatonov, will be delayed by almost a year. The report cited "engine problems" with the frigates.

A Russian warship sails past the Dvortsovy drawbridge rising above the Neva River during rehearsals for the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg.

In a May 2018 research paper, Britain's Chatham House noted the delays in the Gorshkov class, among a wide range of shortcomings in Russia's attempt to build its naval fleet, especially surface forces.

For the next decade Russia's navy will be relying on older, large vessels undergoing constant renovation and overhaul -- as in the case of the Kuznetzov -- and smaller, newer vessel facing production challenges like the Gorshkov, the report said.

Schuster said even when ships join the Russian fleet, that doesn't mean they are necessarily something for foes to worry about.

"Russia has always been good at building but typically put less than 10% of their ships at sea at any one time," he said. "The ships that deploy spend more time at anchorage than operating at sea."

Though Russian press this month has featured numerous stories touting the country's naval buildup and previewing Sunday's parade, the event pales compared to the 2017 version . That was celebrated with events in all corners of the sprawling country, from Vladivostok in the west to Baltiysk, the western base of Russia's Baltic Fleet.

__label__world (CNN) An English immigrant has vowed to fight an order to pay for the "vandalism" of his 123-year-old antique piano, which had its ivory key tops removed and dumped by New Zealand's Department of Conservation (DoC).

The piano, which belongs to University of Auckland professor Julian Paton, had its key tops removed by the DoC last Thursday after being seized in 2017 for breaking the country's ivory laws.

Paton moved to New Zealand with his wife and two children, bringing the piano along with the rest of the family's belongings. He bought the antique for his wife more than 30 years ago as a birthday present, and his children had been learning to play it back in England.

However, the piano was impounded upon arrival due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), an international treaty to protect endangered plants and animals. Under CITES regulations , owners of antique ivory can seek exemption from the law by applying for an export permit.

Paton was unaware of this requirement, and did not apply for the permit. However, he insists that he had followed proper procedures, even hiring a piano expert to examine the piano in England and submit a report to New Zealand immigration authorities.

__label__world Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) For the first time in a generation, there will be a glaring omission on the ballot form when Zimbabweans go to the polls on Monday.

Robert Mugabe may have disappeared from the public view, but his ghost still lingers over a vote which threatens to be one of the closest in the country's history.

Mugabe, now 94, ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before resigning last November amid the pressure of a military takeover and the humiliation of impeachment.

Former President Robert Mugabe kisses his wife and former first lady Grace Mugabe during the country's 37th Independence Day celebrations in 2017.

Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who Mugabe fired as his deputy only weeks before his resignation while attempting to have his wife appointed as his successor, now leads the country and the Zanu-PF party.

Mugabe has rarely been seen in public since, instead spending his time between Singapore, where he is receiving medical treatment, and his plush 25-room Blue House residence in the nation's capital Harare.

Sightings of Mugabe's wife Grace, nicknamed "Gucci Grace" for her love of a lavish lifestyle, have become similarly scarce.

But on Sunday, Mugabe made a rare public appearance to declare he would not vote for his successor Mnangagwa.

Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa addresses a meeting attended by farmers and businessmen from the Zimbabwean White community ahead of this month's elections.

"I can't vote for Zanu-PF. I can't vote for the people who have brought me into this state," Mugabe said during a news conference at his mansion in Harare, on the eve of the election.

"I must say clearly I cannot vote for those who have tormented me. I can't. I will make my case among the other 22 [out of the 23 candidates]."

The former leader added it was "painful" that his name would not be on the voting ballot but that it was "the reality."

Before Sunday "Mugabe himself has not been visible, he's not been saying much about this election," Dewa Mavhinga, Southern Africa Director of Human Rights Watch told CNN.

"There are people who remain loyal to him within Zanu-PF, so that would be a factor -- and that factor might actually reduce the levels of support that the presidential candidate for Zanu-PF enjoys."

That candidate is the current president, Mnangagwa, who has attempted to rebrand the ruling Zanu-PF party. He has already survived one attempt on his life ahead of this election when a grenade was thrown at the stage during a campaign rally last month.

The 75-year-old is still widely considered as Mugabe's man given that he worked so closely with him for more than 40 years, first as his special assistant during the 1977 liberation war, and later as security minister and justice minister.

Mnangagwa has pledged to heal divisions and rebuild the country. "Some have eyes but they do not see, others have ears but cannot hear that we are in a new Zimbabwe," he told a Zanu-PF rally last week, Reuters reported. "Together we will rebuild our nation, a new prosperous Zimbabwe for our people."

'Smokescreen'

The legitimacy of this election has already become a hot topic, the first with some semblance of a contest since the country became independent in 1980.

Members of a European Union election observation team speak to voters in Nyatsime, on July 24, 2018.

Last week, the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights raised concerns of voter intimidation and threats of violence, ahead of Monday's vote.

While UNHCR spokesperson Liz Throssell also noted the presence of election monitors for the first time and said the presence of human rights groups being present around the election was a "welcome sign," there is still some skepticism.

Elections observers from the European Union and the African Union sit on bleachers as leading opposition challenger Nelson Chamisa addresses a campaign rally in Bulawayo.

"It's like a smokescreen," Mavhinga says of the current election setup.

"I think it's a good pretend game which might soon be discarded if a vote goes against the ruling party.

"People are fairly free, I'm talking to you from a hotel I'm putting on my Human Rights Watch T-shirt, I'm freely talking about what is happening and no one is bothering me -- so that's different," he said.

"It is not because they are not observing it, it's just that the machinery has been put on hold. But if an order is given then things could change very rapidly."

The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission hopes any allegations of vote rigging will be prevented by the introduction of a fingerprint ID system which is designed to prevent citizens from registering more than once. Election monitors have also been allowed to observe the run-up to the campaign and will be present on the day.

Economy

The election is forecast to be a close affair between Mnangagwa and Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Nelson Chamisa, who at the age of 40, is the youngest ever presidential candidate.

Zimbabwe's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party leader Nelson Chamisa holds a press conference at the MDC headquarters in Harare.

Chamisa took over the leadership of the MDC following the death of its founder and political heavyweight Morgan Tsvangirai, who died from cancer in February.

Chamisa is hoping to target younger voters with promises of electoral reform, tax cuts and jobs. "People are connecting with young leadership," Chamisa told Agence-France Presse.

"Young people are taking charge, look at France, look at Canada ... look at the United States," he said.

While his message may strike a chord, he does not have the same level of backing from the security forces or military who oversaw Mugabe's departure.

If no candidate secures more than 50 per cent of the vote on 30 July, there will be a run-off on 8 September.

Both men face a mighty challenge to help the country recover from the dire economic situation which was inflicted upon it by Mugabe's rule.

A 100 trillion dollar note from the era before Zimbabwe dropped its own currency and adopted the US dollar.

A chaotic land reform program coupled with hyper-inflation that saw the world's first trillion dollar notes killed Zimbabwe's economy during Mugabe's rule.

Later, under a government of National Unity that included Tsvangirai as Prime Minister, the country was forced to dump its currency and adopt the US dollar.

Relics of Zimbabwe's notorious economic collapse line Harare's streets-- tattered bank notes, vendors selling junk, gate after gate of abandoned factories locked and shut.

There has been some progress with lines of credit being opened between Zimbabwe and the UK, a longstanding opponent of Mugabe's rule, while the European Union has been making encouraging noises over the new regime.

'Look at the poverty'

For many Zimbabweans the lack of economic progress is evident on a daily basis, a constant reminder of life under Mugabe.

Movement for Democratic Change supporters cheer as they gather to listen to their leader Nelson Chamisa.

"I haven't seen much change since November, to be honest," Pearson Mvurume, a 33-year-old cattle herder in Mutare, Zimbabwe's Eastern Highlands, told CNN.

"Even up to now, nothing has changed. I want to see change on July 30, that's when change will come. That's the truth of it."

Mvurume says he will vote for Chamisa in the upcoming election, claiming it was the "only chance for change."

"Look at the poverty around you, these aren't real jobs," he says.

"We are looking forward to real jobs that will come. Look at what I'm doing, herding cattle. That's not a job."

Tafadzwa Chapambare, who also lives in Mutare, told CNN he had never had a job despite being 28 years of age.

"They say if you didn't go to school there will be no job for you, so how are we to survive?" Champambare asked.

"We just want the companies to reopen so we can all have jobs. We have all registered to vote and all we want are jobs in Zimbabwe. And once we vote we want to see changes -- that's all we want in this country."

__label__world (CNN) Populist Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini made a veiled reference to the late fascist dictator Benito Mussolini on Sunday.

Salvini tweeted "tanti nemici, tanto onore," meaning "so many enemies, so much honor," a variation on Mussolini's famous "molti nemici, molto onore," or "many enemies, much honor." He tweeted the comments on the anniversary of Mussolini's birth.

Salvini's tweet came in response to a magazine article about Salvini's critics, including the Catholic Church and leading left-wing intellectuals, and his coinciding rise in popularity.

Separately, in an interview with the UK's Sunday Times newspaper, Salvini, from the right-wing League party, said Italy's low birth rate is being used as an excuse to "import immigrants."

"A country which does not create children is destined to die," he said. "We have created a ministry of the family to work on fertility, nurseries, on a fiscal system which takes large families into account. At the end of this mandate, the government will be measured on the number of newborns more than on its public debt."

__label__world (CNN) Italian police have identified the remains of a French skier more than half a century after he was lost in the Alps, thanks to social media.

In 2005, police in Italy's Aosta region found human remains and ski equipment 3,000 meters (10,000 ft) up in the mountains near the Swiss-Italian border. They thought the man died during a ski descent, but were unable to identify the body at the time.

Italian police released images of the ski equipment found up in the mountains alongside the remains of Henri le Masne

Advances in DNA technology allowed forensic investigators in Turin to narrow down the criteria last year: the man was around 30-years-old, 1.65 meters (5.4 feet) tall, and died sometime in early spring.

Investigators also established that the man went missing sometime in the 1950s, after they dated a coin in his pocket to sometime between 1946-1950.

However, despite their best efforts, they remained unable to put a name to the body, and hypothesized the skier may not have been Italian, meaning no one in the country was likely to identify him.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump's comment that he's willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions shows diplomatic over-confidence, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Armed Services Committee said Monday.

During a joint news conference at the White House alongside Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Trump said that he would meet with Iranian leaders "whenever they want to" with "no preconditions."

California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi said such a meeting would likely not be successful.

"I don't know what the President hopes to achieve with that meeting," he said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." "If the President's going to sit down with them without any preconditions, he must think he's a genius, because if he thinks he can pull off a meeting with the supreme leader of Iran without any prior discussions -- good luck."

Blitzer corrected Garamendi that a hypothetical meeting would likely not be with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, but with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

__label__politics Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) The influential Koch political network announced Monday it is not supporting Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer in his race to unseat vulnerable Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota -- the latest sign the conservative group is frustrated with the current state of the GOP.

The decision for now to stay out of a pivotal 2018 Senate race will likely send shockwaves through the Republican Party and fits with a broader theme from the Koch network's summer meeting that the network feels like it has been "taken for granted" by the GOP.

Top officials at Americans For Prosperity, the political and policy arm of the Koch network, said the group is not currently supporting Cramer because he is not leading on central policy priorities for the Koch network.

"If this were 2016, we likely would have gone ahead and endorsed" Cramer, said AFP President Tim Phillips. "But we're raising the bar."

Speaking to the network's backers Monday, the final day of their summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Phillips criticized Cramer for his support of a $1.3 trillion spending measure earlier this year and his reluctance to take on the White House on trade and tariffs.

__label__politics (CNN) LeBron James thinks President Trump is using athletics, and athletes, to split up the country. And he's rejecting the premise like an opponent's ill-advised layup.

"What I've noticed over the past few months," James shared with CNN's Don Lemon during a sit-down interview on Monday. "(Is) he's kinda used sports to kinda divide us, and that's something that I can't relate to."

Referencing Colin Kaepernick, whose kneeling protests during the pre-game national anthem launched an NFL movement, and more recently, Stephen Curry, who honored his promise of skipping a visit to Donald Trump's White House, James bemoaned a myriad of instances in which Trump has twisted peaceful displays of dissent into an indictment of a decaying American value system.

"I can't sit back and say nothing," said James, who lists participating in youth athletics as one of the most inclusive experiences of his upbringing.

"Sports was the first time I was ever around someone white," revealed the four-time NBA MVP. "I got an opportunity to see them and learn about them, and they got the opportunity to learn about me ... And I was like, 'Oh wow, this is all because of sports.'"

Flashing the trademark smile that has routinely graced magazine covers and commercial shoots since he was a junior in high school , James laughed at learning how much earlier his youthful "white friends" ate dinner and went to bed, and noted his surprise at seeing food stored in a pantry.

"For me, everything where I grew up was on top of the refrigerator," he explained.

Feeding young minds

Now a 33-year-old man, with two sons and a daughter, James has more pantries, and more refrigerators, than he'd ever dreamed of as the child of a single teen mom living the "everyday struggle" in Akron, Ohio. But it's from this existence that his "I Promise School" has been born.

The jitters before the first day of school are real right now!!! Tomorrow is going to be one of the greatest moments (if not the greatest) of my life when we open the #IPROMISE School. This skinny kid from Akron who missed 83 days of school in the 4th grade had big dreams... https://t.co/PwmRaHRfng — LeBron James (@KingJames) July 29, 2018

James' foundation has teamed with the Akron (Ohio) Public Schools system to create an elementary school that will support at-risk children in his hometown.

"We want every kid that walks through this school to be inspired, to come ... away with something, something where they can give back," said James, who poured millions from his own pocket into the project. "For kids, in general, all they want to know is that someone cares. And when they walk through that door, I hope they know that someone cares."

Asked by Lemon about the prospect of entering politics after his playing days, James at first dodged the subject like so many defenders throughout his career. But when asked what he would say if someone told him, "If you don't run, Trump's going to win," he had a change of tune.

"Well, in that case, I may (run)," James said. "I believe there's someone else out there. I hope."

Queried on what he'd say to Trump if they were face to face, he was quick to say, "I would never sit across from him."

James' main focus is helping the next generation conquer their obstacles -- with inspiration from the past.

"If we look at some of the greatest leaders of our time, you look at, you know, Muhammad Ali, you look at Dr. Martin Luther King, and all the adversity they went through," he told Lemon. "They always use it to say 'OK, this is even more motivation, this is even more a way for me to even be more powerful.' And they're the reason why we are here today."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Monday he is willing to meet with Iran's leadership, without preconditions, "whenever they want," a sharp departure from his threats against the regime last week.

"I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet," Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House alongside Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. "I do believe that they will probably end up wanting to meet. I'm ready to meet whenever they want to."

"No preconditions," he added. "They want to meet, I'll meet, whenever they want."

Monday's olive branch from Trump marks an abrupt shift in tone, and may be little more than theater with US midterm elections looming on the horizon. The President has been a strident critic of Iran, threatening the regime with "consequences" as recently as July 22, while his administration pursues a strategy that many see as regime change in all but name.

The President and his senior officials have ramped up the rhetoric against Tehran, promising to " crush " its economy with international sanctions and accusing it of fomenting terrorism and regional instability, while telling the country's citizens that their leaders are corrupt.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not address Trump's comments on Tuesday, instead focusing on the "illegal" US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal back in May, in a statement posted on his official website.

"After the US's illegal withdrawal from the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), the ball is in Europe's court in the limited time remaining," said Rouhani of the deal, as part of a report about his meeting with British Ambassador to Tehran Rob Macaire.

The international nuclear agreement forced Iran to curtail its uranium enrichment capacity to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons, and imposed stringent verification processes, in exchange for relief on crippling sanctions.

The remaining members of the Iran nuclear deal are still committed to the international pact, as is Iran.

'Nothing wrong with meeting'

Trump touted the benefits of diplomacy, saying he would "meet with anybody" and once again argued that his July 12 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- which drew heated bipartisan criticism -- was a success.

"Speaking to other people, especially when you're talking about potentials of war and death and famine and lots of other things -- you meet. There's nothing wrong with meeting," Trump said.

While Trump said he would apply no preconditions to meeting with Iran, he did appear to hedge the possibility of a meeting on an ability to "work something out that's meaningful."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the President had made the offer before. "The President wants to meet with folks to solve problems," Pompeo told CNBC. "If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it's worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he's prepared to sit down and have the conversation with them."

The President's sudden willingness to consider a meeting with Iran's leaders echoes his about-face on meeting with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un. Trump has suggested in the past that financial pressure would eventually bring Tehran to the table. Iran's leaders have shown little interest in engaging with the US, however, particularly given the Trump administration's decision to leave the nuclear accord and -- in an echo of its approach to North Korea -- its subsequent drive to squeeze Iran's economy.

After leaving the deal, the Trump White House has moved to reinstate sanctions on Tehran in two major tranches. Some will be reimposed in August and target autos, gold and other key metals, while others will snap back in November and target the energy sector and transactions with Iran's central bank.

The sanctions would punish firms that do business with Iranian entities. Brian Hook, the State Department's director of policy planning, said on July 2 that more than 50 international firms have already announced their plans to leave Iran, "particularly in the energy and finance sectors."

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did leave open the door to the possibility of engagement with the US this month in Tehran when he said that Americans "must understand that war with Iran is the mother of all wars and peace with Iran is the mother of all peace," according to the state-run news agency IRNA.

To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2018

But talks seem highly unlikely anytime soon. In his July 22 tweet, Trump said, "To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE."

He continued, writing in all capital letters, that: "WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!"

Senior administration officials have also deployed increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Iran. The day before Trump's fiery tweet, Pompeo likened the Iranian regime to the mafia and accused the ruling clerics of enriching themselves and funding terrorism at the expense of ordinary Iranians in a speech at the Ronald Reagan National Library in Simi Valley, California.

"To the regime, prosperity, security and freedom for the Iranian people are acceptable casualties in the march to fulfill the revolution," Pompeo said. "The level of corruption and wealth among regime leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government."
__label__world (CNN) It's been a tortuous journey for Francisca Awah. Last month, the 35-year-old from Cameroon spoke in front of an audience that included Ivanka Trump and the US Secretary of State, when she was honored for her contribution to the fight against human trafficking.

But just three years ago Awah was living in modern slavery, trapped and abused as a domestic worker in Kuwait.

In the spring of 2015, Awah answered an advertisement for an English-teaching job in Kuwait. The pay was good, better than anything she could earn in her home town of Kumba, in south-west Cameroon, even though she had a Masters degree and spoke fluent English. She had a two-year-old son to support, and when she was offered the job, she accepted.

The reality, it turned out, was very different.

'Sick and exhausted'

When she arrived in Kuwait she says she was immediately taken to work as a maid in a private home, employed through an agency. She says she was moved between homes for a few weeks, and then eventually ended up with a Kuwaiti family, who she says took her passport.

Awah says the family forced her to work long hours, sometimes in the blistering Kuwaiti sun, with very little sleep.

She says she got sick and exhausted and suffered from back pain from the constant cleaning.

When she asked to leave she says the family told her she would have to repay the $3,000 they had given the agency for her, and she would also have to pay for her flight home.

She says she was paid 75 Kuwaiti dinars (about $250) a month for the two months she was with the family.

Stories of hope

Awah says she plucked up the courage to turn on the television while she was working. She found herself watching The CNN Freedom Project , which reports on all forms of modern slavery.

"Sometimes they show people that they have saved," she later told CNN. "I was having hopes."

One report, profiling Katie Ford, the former CEO of a modeling agency, who now runs anti-slavery organization Freedom for All in the US, struck a particular chord.

Awah says she had a cell phone and used it to find Ford's details on the internet. She contacted Ford, who coached her through her eventual escape to a friendly embassy, and then paid for her flight to Cameroon.

Francisca Awah with Katie Ford at the Freedom For All Gala in New York City, May 2016.

The family deny they prevented Awah from leaving or asked her to pay back the $3,000. They say she was not overworked, and that she worked no more than eight hours a day as stated in the contract from the agency, but they did admit that she did not sign that contract.

Vulnerable to forced labor

There are more than 600,000 migrant domestic workers in Kuwait, in a population of 4 million people.

The 2018 US State Department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report says that migrant domestic workers in Kuwait are particularly vulnerable to forced labor inside private homes.

It also says that "Kuwait's sponsorship law -- which ties a migrant worker's legal residence and valid immigration status to an employer -- restricts workers' movements and penalizes them for leaving abusive workplaces." It adds that employers often confiscate passports, although it's illegal.

But the report notes that the Kuwaiti government is making significant efforts to tackle the problem.

It has introduced a law guaranteeing domestic workers one day off per week, a maximum 12-hour workday, a minimum wage paid monthly and paid annual leave. It has also set up "a government-run central recruitment company intended to reduce recruitment costs and combat illegal recruiting fees."

Supporting survivors

In the months after Awah made it back home she started to share her story, to try to raise awareness about the risk of trafficking.

She was keenly aware that if people found hardship when they returned home, they could be re-trafficked. "If you rescue someone and the person is not self-sufficient what do you expect?" she told CNN.

Awah eventually set up a non-profit organization called Survivors' Network . She says it provides interim employment for trafficking survivors on a poultry farm, as well as microfinance, so women can set up their own businesses.

Survivors' Network raises awareness in schools.

She also champions women's education and teaches people to spot the signs of trafficking, getting the word out through churches, schools, local radio stations and social media. Awah says her organization has advised more than 500 African women trapped in domestic servitude in Kuwait and Lebanon on how to return home.

Anti-trafficking 'hero'

In June, Awah was named by the U.S. State Department as a TIP report "Hero" -- an individual who has made a particular contribution to the fight against human trafficking.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Ivanka Trump present Awah with her 'TIP Report Hero' certificate.

"A few years ago, I could have only dreamt of such an honor" she told the audience of State Department officials at the TIP report launch ceremony, in Washington DC.

And she shared her message with them, that rescue is not enough: "To prevent trafficking, people need vocational training to build skills so that they can work and become self-sufficient in their home countries."

Awah admits it can be hard to keep telling her story, but doing so has become one of her most powerful tools.

"We can all talk about this issue in our schools and workplaces and over dinner with our families," she told the State Department audience. "The more people who know and care, the more people we will save."
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Men have long dominated Nigeria's DJ scene. However, a new breed of highly successful female DJs are challenging the status quo, attracting legions of fans and changing perceptions both at home and abroad.

Among them is the masked DJ Switch who first rose to prominence after winning the first African edition of X-Factor in 2013.

Although she won as a rapper, Switch has concentrated on forging out a career as a DJ and wants to take on the men at their own game.

"The DJ scene in Nigeria is obviously male-dominated. A lot of them are just scared, to be honest, of what potentially a woman could do," she says.

"I am being really frank on this issue," she continues.

"There are very few male DJs that just are happy to see you. To be honest, in my experience, I've only met one here in Nigeria, and I've met a lot outside Nigeria who are just happy. They tell you, 'Wow. What you did is great. I want to learn what you did. Can you show me that?'

"They don't look at the gender," says Switch, who considered working as a geologist before opting for a life behind the decks.

Nigeria's DJ Switch is famed for her distinctive mask on the decks.

For Switch, she is an artist first and a female DJ second.

"I don't see a gender in front of that term DJ. It's an art." she says. "I'm an artist, and so I will refer to myself as a DJ. But for the purpose of making people really see, really appreciate the work that I've put in, I'd say female DJ."

One of the best-known performers in Africa, is DJ Cuppy, who prides herself on flying the flag for her profession and for African music on a global scale.

She has found a home of sorts in London and a base for her mission to increase the influence of African music.

Having studied in the UK, she performs on the London circuit where her company Red Velvet Music is also situated.

"For me its all about advocacy, making sure that people are aware of the beautiful sounds," she adds.

"I want people to feel like 'gosh, I want to find out what all these songs are,' because it's so different to what they are used to."

Cuppy is the daughter of Femi Otedola, one of Nigeria's wealthiest oil magnates.

She acknowledges her privilege and says she wants to use her success to inspire other female DJs.

"I'm in a very unique position, because typically when a lot of us grow up in Nigeria, we're told if not to be housewives, we're told to be doctors and lawyers," she says.

"I feel like my brand is speaking of a bit of a rebellion movement, where we're saying, 'you know what? Women can do this as well'."

This new generation, or 'rebellion movement' as Cuppy calls it, is already changing the landscape and inspiring the next generation in the process.

"Women are very, very powerful," Cuppy says. "It's just about unlocking that power. A lot of the time as a woman you are constricted as to what you can do. I had to leave Nigeria to realize my power.

"Because of what I have been able to achieve outside Nigeria, a lot of young Nigerians are now taking the same risks, and actually, Nigeria is modernizing."

DJ Switch believes that any aspiring female DJ is required to show she has the skills and technique to compete alongside their male peers.

"How I am changing people's perspective is trying to make people understand, first of all, that DJing is a craft. It's an art. It's not just mixing music."
__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency has launched an app called iReport that allows people to report cases of human trafficking in the country.

Using the app, citizens can alert local authorities on human trafficking incidents, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) said in a statement.

Nigeria is top among African countries where thousands of women and children are trafficked illegally to destinations abroad especially in Europe.

The I nternational Organization for Migration said around 11,000 women and 3,000 children who arrived by sea in Italy in 2016 were from Nigeria.

Eighty percent of all women and girls arriving from Nigeria to Europe are potential victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, the group estimates, noting that exploitation of younger girls is on the rise.

__label__world (CNN) Election results were being tallied on Tuesday in Zimbabwe, a day after more than two-thirds of the nation's registered voters cast their ballots in the country's first presidential poll since the end of Robert Mugabe's nearly four decade rule.

The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) began announcing results for candidates at a local level Tuesday, but said it would only announce the presidential result once all of the 10,985 polling stations had verified their results.

The vote was forecast to be a close race between current President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Nelson Chamisa, who both hinted they were ahead on Tuesday.

People queue early Monday morning at a polling station in the Harare suburb of Chitungwiza.

Mnangagwa, 75, who took power after helping to orchestrate a de facto coup against Mugabe in November, said he was receiving "extremely positive" information on the election. While Chamisa, 40, said his party was poised for victory

ZEC chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba told reporters in Harare on Tuesday that the Commission was confident there was no cheating or rigging in the largely peaceful vote. Observers present to monitor the election for the first time in years, including 20 teams from the United States Embassy in Harare, have not yet shared their assessments.

__label__world New Delhi (CNN) A day after a controversial citizenship audit put a question mark on the status of an estimated 4 million Indians living along the country's border with Bangladesh, the Indian government faced scathing criticism from political opponents accusing it of trampling over human rights of its people.

A draft of the so-called National Register of Citizens (NRC) was released Monday, amid popular anger over illegal migration into Assam, which shares a porous border with Bangladesh.

Proponents of the registry say it will help root out illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, but the move has prompted fears of possible deportation among Assam's hundreds of thousands of Bengali-speaking Muslims.

The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said it would not move to deport anybody, and would allow time for a lengthy appeals process for those left out of the registry.

Many of the Assam minority Bengali community have lived in India for decades, crossing the border into the state during the bloody Bangladesh independence struggle in 1971. Many others can trace their history back even further, arriving before the independence of India in 1947.

__label__world (CNN) Ten people have been killed and more than 100,000 have been forced to flee their homes after days of heavy monsoon rains flooded villages in central and southern Myanmar, according to government officials.

The Burmese National Disaster Management Committee has urged residents near river banks and low-lying areas to move to higher ground, after floods shut down roads and submerged villages, leaving communities stranded.

As of Tuesday, more than 119,000 people across five provinces had been displaced by rising waters, with Magway Region in central Myanmar particularly hard hit, with more than 70,000 affected, said Min Thein, director of Myanmar's Department of Disaster Management.

Images released by Myanmar's Ministry of Information show rescue boats evacuating people, while children and families cling to rooftops to escape rising water levels.

However, attempts to reach many of those affected have been hampered by heavy rains. Three of the ten people killed in the floods have been soldiers aiding in the rescue effort, said Thein.

__label__world (CNN) A group of angry Chinese parents and activists have gathered twice in two days outside government buildings in Beijing to protest a recent scandal over defective vaccines, a rare display of public dissatisfaction in the tightly-policed Chinese capital.

The government announced in mid-July they would take disciplinary action over more than 600,000 diphtheria and tetanus (DPT) vaccines, an unknown number of which may have been administrated to children, sparking massive public anger.

Holding signs saying "Vaccine?" and calling for legislation to ensure tighter drug safety standards, more than two dozen protestors gathered outside the offices of the National Health Commission on Monday and the National State Drug Administration on Tuesday.

"Please fulfill the leaders' instructions. Please give vaccine victims a fair chance," their signs read.

Small group of protestors hold a rare public demonstration over the vaccine scandal in front of China's National Health Commission in Beijing on Monday July 30.

The two-day protest showed concerns over the vaccine scandal have yet to dissipate, as the Chinese government continues to resist calls to release further information detailing the results of their investigation around the faulty vaccines.

__label__world (CNN) The world's largest colony of king penguins has shrunk by almost 90% in the last three decades, researchers said Monday.

The colony lies on the subantarctic French island of Île aux Cochons, or Pig Island, and once numbered over two million king penguins. When scientists last stepped foot on the island in 1982, it was not only the world's largest king penguin colony, but the second largest colony of all penguins.

However, when researchers from the Chizé Center for Biological Studies (CNRS) returned to survey the island in 2016 and 2017, the colony had collapsed. The total population had shrunk by 88%, down to barely 200,000 king penguins. Before, there had been half a million breeding pairs -- now, only 60,000 remain.

The remote island in the southern Indian Ocean is so inaccessible that researchers have not conducted new population estimates for decades, leaving the exact cause of the population drop a mystery. However, there are several possible factors, which are explored in the full report published last week in the Antarctic Science journal.

Photographs and satellite images taken over the decades found the colony's territory has shrunk, taken over by encroaching vegetation. The decline also began in the late 1990s, the same time a major climatic event related to the cyclical weather phenomenon El Niño took place in the Southern Ocean, potentially affecting the penguins' ability to forage for food.

__label__world (CNN) At least 10 people were killed when militants linked to the Abu Sayyaf terror group struck a military checkpoint with a car bomb in the southern Philippines Tuesday, officials said.

Philippines Army Lieutenant Colonel Jonas Templo said an improvised explosive was detonated in the early hours of the morning, in the Sitio Maganda neighborhood of Lamitan, a city in Basilan province.

Basilan Governor Jim Salliman said at least five others were wounded by the attack, which used a van and targeted a checkpoint manned by a Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) -- a paramilitary contingent which included military and civilians.

Salliman said the Armed Forces of the Philippines told him Abu Sayyaf was responsible for the blast.

Mindanao -- the Philippines' southernmost major island, on which Basilan sits -- is home to several Islamist insurgent groups, including Abu Sayyaf, which has been blamed for a number of attacks on civilians and Philippine government troops, as well as the kidnapping of several foreign nationals.

__label__world (CNN) French children will have to leave their smartphones and smart devices at home or switched off when they are at school starting in September.

The ban on smartphones as well as other kinds of internet-connected devices, such as tablets, applies to schoolchildren between 3 and 15 years of age, and was passed by lawmakers on Monday. French high schools, or lycées, with students 15 and older, will get to choose whether to adopt the phone ban for their pupils.

"We know today that there is a phenomenon of screen addiction, the phenomenon of bad mobile phone use... Our main role is to protect children and adolescents. It is a fundamental role of education, and this law allows it," said Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer on French news channel BFMTV

The law fulfills one of President Emmanuel Macron's campaign promises. It passed 62 votes to one, supported by members of Macron's centrist La République en Marche! party. Some lawmakers from the right and the left abstained, claiming the law would change little.

"This isn't a 21st century law in our eyes, but a law from the era of news channels and binary debate," said Alexis Corbière, a deputy from the left-wing Unbowed France party and a former teacher.

__label__world (CNN) Three men walk into a room: a dictator, an autocrat, and an ayatollah. A fourth man asks them each for a meeting.

The dictator is desperate, grabs it and bags the benefits. The autocrat smiles and sits smugly through it. The ayatollah doesn't answer.

This will be President Trump's conundrum with Iran: whatever he does, Iran will play the long game.

Trump told the world on Monday: "I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet. I don't know that they're ready yet." That may be one of his more accurate statements of late.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani met with the new British Ambassador to Tehran Tuesday where he announced, not for the first time, the US withdrawal from the multilateral nuclear deal in May was "illegal," adding that "the ball is in Europe's court."

It seems that Iran -- and Rouhani is the face of it right now -- is playing the pragmatist. For Iran, it's better to keep some enemies on its side rather than alienate them all at once.

After all, it wasn't the UK, Germany and France who withdrew from the six-nation Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , but the US alone.

Rather than ripping up the JCPOA and ramping up nuclear production, Iran has only talked about building up its stockpile of centrifuges for uranium enrichment that could be used to make a bomb.

Iranian officials have said it is up to the JCPOA's European signatories to make the agreement work to Iran's benefit, meaning Tehran don't suffer financially because of it.

That is in itself an implicit threat, because Trump is set to slap secondary sanctions on European businesses trading in Iran. But it's not a commitment to confrontation.

Iran is talking as much to divide its enemies as to conquer. This is what the Iranians do well. Just ask former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the JCPOA with them. It was a long and tortuous process, with concessions only coming at the eleventh hour, partial and offered only grudgingly.

Whereas Trump does angry and impetuous to a tee, Iran's theocratic leaders are masters in the art of the ambiguity and sleight of hand.

Where Trump wields the diplomatic equivalent of a battle ax, they excel with the subtle skill of death by a thousand cuts.

They haven't, for example, massively ratcheted up retaliation by reverting to the use of regional proxies, like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia militias in Syria, to attack US allies and interests. This strategic restraint, outside of a few isolated incidents, is a measure of the caution with which Iran is wielding those knives.

Trump's one-on-one summits -- all style, little substance -- have been with completely different types of people.

President Vladimir Putin of Russia, like Kim Jong Un of North Korea, is not as vulnerable as Iran's leaders. Kim's economy might be hurting, but his grip on power seems rock solid and public dissent is almost unheard of.

Putin rules his roost and controls the media and the national narrative, keeping him popular and allowing him room to indulge in a little showmanship with Trump, whom he seems to find to be a US President with much potential for benefiting Russia.

In the mind of Iran's Ayatollah right now must be the saying President George W. Bush managed to mangle: "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."

Having agreed to destroy, ship out or mothball much of its nuclear capabilities in return for the lifting of sanctions once already at America's behest, why should Iran trust Trump, or any leader that follows him, to keep America's word?

The answer Trump is giving right now is that the Iranians have no choice: He'll cripple its economy if they don't. That said, when he stood next to Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday, Trump sounded almost subtle: "I do believe that they will probably end up wanting to meet ... I think it's an appropriate thing to do. If we could work something out that's meaningful, not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be willing to meet."

And therein lies the rub: Even if the Iranians were tempted to talk -- which its lawmakers are most definitely indicating they are not -- there is little evidence that his recent summits have been anything more than glorified handshakes.

The minimalist four-point agreement with Kim is already breaking down, as the North Koreans appear to renege on what Trump said was agreed while complaining that Trump's officials are "bullying" them.

As for Putin, Trump's race to get face time with him seems to have amounted to little that he could take home to the bank.

Iran's deputy Foreign Minister, Bahram Qasemi, warns that "Washington's hostile measures against Tehran and its efforts to put economic pressure on the country and impose sanctions, there will remain no possibility of talks."

For now, it seems Trump is more likely to have a second round with Putin than he is to have a first face-to-face with Rouhani. However much the Iranians are hurting, political capital -- not just the economy -- is at stake.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The separation of undocumented families under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy is the result of a "deliberate" process that ultimately amounted to "official kidnapping and child abuse," Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Tuesday.

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Connecticut Democrat was part of Tuesday's hearing on the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which resulted in children being separated from their parents at the southern border.

With more than 500 children still separated despite a court-ordered deadline to reunite them by last Thursday, the focus of Tuesday's hearing was family separation. Blumenthal said he was outraged by what he heard.

"From the day that I went to the border, which was six weeks ago, there has been no plan, no system to reunite these children," Blumenthal told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room."

"It amounts to official kidnapping and child abuse."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday embraced a line of defense offered by his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that "collusion is not a crime," even though he continued to deny any alleged ties between his campaign and Moscow during the 2016 election.

"Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!" Trump tweeted.

Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018

For months, Trump has insisted that there was "no collusion," but his Tuesday morning tweet hints at a potential expansion of his defense amid the ongoing special counsel investigation. Speaking to CNN's "New Day" on Monday, Giuliani said he wasn't sure if collusion was a crime

The President has repeatedly denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and Moscow, and he told The New York Times in December that "collusion is not a crime."

Legal experts, however, have repeatedly said that anyone found collaborating with Russia on the 2016 election could be charged with other crimes, such as conspiracy, and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has not concluded.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) A top immigration official on Tuesday said family detention centers are "more like summer camp" than a jail during a congressional hearing on the administration's efforts to reunite thousands of immigrant families separated as a result of its zero-tolerance immigration policy.

Asked at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to describe the so-called family residential centers where kids and parents are held, Matthew Albence, the head of enforcement and removal operations for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, made the comparison of the detention centers to a summer camp.

"These individuals have access to 24/7 food and water. They have educational opportunities. They have recreational opportunities, both structured as well as unstructured," Albence said. "There's basketball courts, there's exercise classes, there's soccer fields that we put in there. They have extensive medical, dental and mental health opportunities. In fact, many of these individuals, the first time they've ever seen a dentist is when they've come to one of our (family residential) centers."

Later in the hearing, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked panelists if they had been to any of the family residential centers. Two of the five panelists said they had visited the facilities. She then asked the two panelists whether they would feel comfortable sending their child to one.

"That's a difficult question to answer, " said Jennifer Higgins, the associate director of refugee, asylum and international operations at US Citizenship and Immigration Services. "It's difficult to put myself in the position of an individual who takes a dangerous journey in which their child could be harmed, let alone whether I would send my children."

__label__politics (CNN) The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won't -- for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn't seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.

The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall — and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means — and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months — that, ultimately, this isn't a legal fight, it's a public relations one.

Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota. "I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it," Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.

"My version" vs. "their version." What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the "versions" will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other "version" will be Giuliani's cable TV appearances and President Trump's tweets.

That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion -- particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump's side.
__label__politics (CNN) White House chief of staff John Kelly announced at a senior staff meeting Monday that President Donald Trump asked him to stay on as chief of staff until at least 2020 -- and that he agreed -- three White House officials confirmed to CNN.

The news came after Kelly marked his first anniversary as chief of staff amid a swirl of rumors about his potentially imminent departure. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of Kelly's plans.

Kelly has seen his status as chief of staff diminished in recent months, with the President circumventing many of the policies and protocols the retired Marine Corps general put in place when he entered the West Wing last year.

In the two weeks leading up to Trump's disruptive swing through Europe, senior aides predicted that Kelly had days or hours left. Those same aides now think the ensuing chaos of the trip may have helped Kelly hang on a little longer.
__label__politics (CNN) Federal security officials have created a new level of defense aimed at protecting banks, energy companies and other structures from massive cyberhacking attempts, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced Tuesday in New York.

The announcement of the National Risk Management Center, a physical space that was created inside DHS, was made as Nielsen called out Russia for meddling in the 2016 election in her most forceful public comments to date on the matter. But she still stopped short of endorsing a key US intelligence finding that Russia interfered with the aim of helping President Donald Trump's candidacy.

"Let me be clear: Our intelligence community has it right. It was the Russians. We know that. They know that. It was directed from the highest levels. And we cannot and will not allow that to happen again," Nielsen said.

The DHS chief said cyberthreats have now surpassed physical threats in endangering the US.

"Don't get me wrong, terrorists and criminals still pose a serious threat to our lives, and they are plotting against Americans daily. However, the 'attack surface' in cyberspace is now broader and under more frequent assault," Nielsen said.

__label__politics (CNN) Lawmakers are grilling top immigration officials Tuesday over the administration's now reversed "zero tolerance" policy at the border and the thousands of family separations that occurred as a result.

Speaking at the outset of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized family separations, though they offered different explanations for why it occurred and what should happen next.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he was disturbed by reports that parents were deported without their children without understanding paperwork they'd signed.

"The administration claims that all of these parents elected to be deported without their children. But public reports ... indicate that many of them may not have made an informed choice to leave their children behind," Grassley said. "Some of these reports suggest that these parents weren't presented information in a language that they could even understand. So we ought to be disturbed, and I'm disturbed by these allegations."

Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, called family separations a "humanitarian disaster" and called for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to step down.

__label__politics (CNN) Donald Trump l-o-v-e-s a good plot twist. And that's what he gave political Washington on Tuesday when news broke that Trump had asked embattled chief of staff John Kelly to stay on through the 2020 election -- and that Kelly had agreed.

The narrative of the last few months in Washington had been Kelly's isolation from Trump and the increasing likelihood that the chief of staff would leave 1600 Pennsylvania sooner rather than later. Wrote Politico's Eliana Johnson just two days ago

"A year into the job, Kelly's attempts to implement traditional processes in an untraditional White House have failed, according to a dozen people in and outside the administration. ... Kelly, people around him say, no longer works to keep his mercurial boss on task or on message, with a Republican close to the White House referring to him as a "chief of staff in name only."

How the heck did we go from "Kelly is a dead man walking" to "Kelly is in through 2020?" Lots of reasons -- from the fact that Trump likes to upset expectations and keep his staff on their toes to the fact that replacing Kelly at the moment might have been more trouble than it's worth given the chaos surrounding the President's handling of the ongoing special counsel probe into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election.

I'd be wary, however, of falling into the "why" trap on this Kelly announcement. Because analyzing "why" Trump reversed course on Kelly suggests that this pact to keep Kelly on through the 2020 election will actually hold all the way through 2020.

And if Trump is Trump and history is any guide, it won't.

That doesn't mean that Trump and Kelly don't believe as of today that their partnership will last as long as advertised. They do! Think of it like junior high school when you and your friend pledge that you will be best friends forever. In that moment, you both totally believe it. But life intrudes. You go to different high schools. Or you go to the same high school but grow apart. Or you go to different colleges. Life happens.

That's sort of how you should think of this Trump-Kelly announcement. Trump is hugely mercurial. There is a reason that everyone assumed Kelly would be gone sometime soon -- because aides, channeling Trump, told reporters that the President was sick of Kelly and wanted him gone. Trump appears to have changed his mind on the Kelly question sometime recently (and, as I note above, for reasons that can be guessed at but never truly known). Trump may totally mean to keep Kelly on through 2020 as of today. In a month, he may have totally changed his mind.

All you need to know about Trump's mindset when he made this offer to Kelly is that the President initially asked him to stay in the job through the end of his second term in 2024, according to CNN's Kaitlan Collins . 2024! That would make Kelly the longest-serving chief of staff ever, far surpassing Andy Card, who stayed in the top job for President George W. Bush for five years.

Given what we know about Trump's lack of long-term strategic planning, it's very, very hard to imagine that Trump thought totally through the idea of Kelly staying on for the next six years -- or even the next two-plus years. Trump decided -- likely in the spur of the moment -- to keep Kelly and, because the President doesn't do anything halfway, offered Kelly to stay on for as long as Trump could possibly hope to be President.

Trump knows a few important things about making a move like that.

First, there's zero penalty for changing your mind. Everyone in the White House serves at the pleasure of the President -- more so with this President than most. If in six months Trump gets rid of Kelly, does anyone think that he would pay a price for it -- with voters or with Republican members of Congress? Answer: No.

Second, Trump has made clear time and time again that he believes he is the only person who matters in the White House (or the broader government). "Let me tell you, the one that matters is me," Trump said in November 2017. "I'm the only one that matters, because when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be. You've seen that, you've seen it strongly." He was talking about openings in the State Department, but the idea applies. Trump views himself as the only indispensable piece in the White House. He is, in his own mind, the best chief of staff, communications director and, well, everything else that exists in Washington (or the world).

So Kelly's role -- at least what the role has become -- is to, largely, let Trump be Trump and stay out of the way. Which is not the typical job description of a chief of staff.

In short: Donald Trump and John Kelly have a partnership. For now.
__label__politics President Donald Trump was also following the developments of Manafort, his former campaign chairman, from Air Force One, and had his legal team giving him updates.

This is the first criminal trial brought by the team of special counsel Robert Mueller.

Here are five takeaways:

Flipping Is Off the Menu?

This trial is really happening. After months of speculation of whether Manafort would "flip" on his campaign associates and Trump, Manafort never reached a deal with prosecutors.

Mueller's team plans to rely on a boatload of documents, emails and witnesses to paint Manafort as a serial liar who deceived the federal government, his own accountants and banks and orchestrated his business associates into setting up a criminal financial enterprise.

Prosecutor Uzo Asonye started the first words of the trial with this line: "A man in this courtroom believed the law did not apply to him."

There were rumblings of a deal Monday night, after defense lawyers and the Justice Department jointly agreed to drop Manafort's appeal of the loss in his civil lawsuit challenging Mueller's authority. Yet no plea materialized in court Tuesday.

He could always change his mind, plead guilty and agree to cooperate with Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion at any time before a jury returns a verdict.

But why wouldn't Manafort roll the dice on the jury and hope for the President's sympathies now?

Trump has offered pardons to several others, especially to those convicted of public corruption crimes, and tweeted his support of Manafort. "Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns," tweeted the President, who would be the sole person with power to pardon Manafort if he's convicted in this case. "Very unfair!"

All About Gates

Manafort's relationship with his right-hand man, Rick Gates, appears to be over.

Defense attorney Thomas Zehnle focused more than half of his opening statement on Gates, calling him the prosecution's "star witness" and, conversely, calling him an embezzler. He described how his team would show how Gates "did it" -- that is, handled much of Manafort's business dealings that the government says were criminal, while also swindling Manafort.

Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in DC federal court related to his dealings with Manafort in February -- effectively flipping on Manafort -- and prosecutors dropped the part of the case against him in Virginia. One of those crimes was lying to investigators, Zehnle pointed out in an early attack on his trustworthiness.

If Manafort successfully cuts into his longtime deputy's credibility, that could spell problems for the entire Mueller investigation. Gates has agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department for as long as it sees fit, and prosecutors told him long ago they sought his help in their core mission of investigating Russian interference in the presidential election, according to CNN reporting. (The allegations at issue in Manafort's case barely touch his and Gates' work on the Trump campaign.)

A Whiff of Russia

Democratic political consultant Tad Devine's appearance as the first witness may signal that the jurors will be schooled on Ukrainian politics.

Devine worked with Manafort and his team of associates on political campaigns in the region for years. And for almost an hour, prosecutor Greg Andres walked Devine through his knowledge of several Manafort contacts and business strategies in the Eastern European country, including his contact with oligarch and Party of Regions backer Rinat Akhmetov.

The former Ukrainian president for whom Manafort did the most work, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia after losing power in 2014 and is now considered to be closely aligned with President Vladimir Putin.

Devine also discussed how Manafort and Gates in 2014 sought unsuccessfully to pivot toward helping a budding opposition party and working for the current Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko.

Manafort's jury of peers

Six men and six women will decide Manafort's guilt. The 69-year-old faces a maximum sentence of more than 300 years in prison if these Northern Virginians side against him.

When the courtroom filled with jurors Tuesday morning, they looked much like Manafort -- largely middle-aged, white. Two potential jurors said they were "recovering attorneys," while four said they were former or current federal government employees.

However, none of those individuals made the jury.

Not much is known about the 12 individuals and four alternates. These people in the courtroom will be known only by their juror numbers and their observable appearances during the trial: Juror 145, Juror 299, Juror 276, etc. Almost three-quarters of the jury is white. At least four jurors are younger than Manafort.

What's left are a few people who closed their eyes during the hours of proceedings Tuesday. Several who put on glasses for the start of opening statements. And one man who looked unhappy to be chosen then took close notes.

Lightning Speed

Before heading into Tuesday, court-watchers expected a slow start to the trial, with the jury selection process to last up to two days and for opening statements to start on the third day. Judge T.S. Ellis had other ideas. The pace so far has repositioned the trial from one that could bore jurors and get bogged down in financial technicalities to one that's whipping by.

Ellis set a tight schedule for opening arguments Tuesday: 30 minutes or less. Asonye and defense lawyer Thomas Zehnle kept each of their summations of the case to about that time.

And then following a short break, prosecutor Greg Andres began to question Devine. Andres pelted questions at a quick clip and showed more than a dozen documents to the jury as evidence of Devine and Manafort's Ukrainian work. At about a half hour into Andres' questioning of Devine, Ellis cut in. How much more with this witness, he asked. "Move it along," Ellis said.

Day two begins Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Democrat Danny O'Connor is putting his call for new leadership in both parties front and center in the final days of the Ohio special election and one week after the candidate delivered an unartful answer on his opposition to Rep. Nancy Pelosi as the party's leader in the House.

O'Connor's final ad, released first to CNN, comes as Republicans are going on air to highlight Ohio Gov. John Kasich's support for Republican nominee Troy Balderson to represent the state's 12th Congressional District and are attacking O'Connor's support for energy regulations.

The election August 7 is the final special election test for both parties ahead of November's midterms. Democrats are eager to close out a strong special election season by overperforming in another traditionally Republican district.

"The same old politics in Washington just aren't working. Democrats and Republicans are at each other's throats every day, leaving the issues that matter most to your family behind," O'Connor says. "We need new leadership in both parties."

He adds: "Instead of corporate giveaways that pile up debt, let's cut taxes for working people, let's fight back against drug and insurance company greed, let's protect every dime of the Social Security and Medicare benefits seniors have earned."

Democratic operatives working on the race said the closing argument ad is meant to contrast O'Connor's positive messaging with Balderson's use of attack ads.

"Danny is doing something different," said one operative. "This ad is designed to cut through the noise."

That noise is the string of negative headlines about O'Connor's answer during an MSNBC interview last week, where host Chris Matthews pushed the candidate on his opposition to Pelosi. The back-and-forth eventually led O'Connor to say he "would support whoever the Democrats put forward" on the House floor. O'Connor has made his opposition to Pelosi central to his campaign, including highlighting it in his first TV ad.

Republicans were quick to highlight O'Connor's answer.

"After last night's pathetic interview by Danny O'Connor, Democrats' talking points disavowing Nancy Pelosi are as flimsy as the paper they're written on," said Matt Gorman, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "Once you get them beyond a noun, a verb and 'new leadership,' they fold like a cheap suit."

O'Connor stood by his opposition to Pelosi -- "No DC-style gotcha politics will change my resolve," he told CNN -- and his aides argued that it is highly unlikely Democrats would put Pelosi forward after November's election if she didn't have the votes from her caucus.

Republicans are closing the race with a mix of messages. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to House leadership that has spent $2.6 million on ads in this race, released an ad on Tuesday highlighting Kasich's support for Balderson. Kasich, before becoming governor and running for president, represented the suburban Columbus district for 18 years.

"On August 7, we're going to elect a new member of Congress. Troy Balderson was a partner of mine as a member of the Ohio Legislature and he helped in cutting taxes and turning Ohio around," Kasich says in the straight-to-camera ad . "Troy shares our common-sense values on important issues that face us today. Troy Balderson has my vote."

Kaisch held out on supporting Balderson for months and didn't make an official endorsement until last week. The lack of endorsement created an awkward tension, especially considering Balderson was tying himself to Trump, a Republican whom Kasich has publicly criticized.

"I don't know that it helps a lot," Balderson said of Kasich's endorsement in an interview with CNN earlier this month. "There are different areas that Gov. Kasich is well received, but I got to run on Troy Balderson."

The ad is meant to cut into O'Connor's outreach to Kasich voters, a pitch he has made both in person and with a television ad

"This really hurts O'Connor," said a Republican operative familiar with the strategy. "These are directed at the people he is trying to court."

In another example of the push and pull for Balderson in the race, his campaign highlighted his support from Trump on the same day the super PAC released its Kasich ad.

"Wow -- it's a huge honor to have President Donald Trump come out so strong in support of my campaign," Balderson said in a fundraising email to supporters. "The Commander-in-Chief needs more Trump Republicans in Congress who will support his America-First agenda, and I'm ready and willing to help."

Although Republicans jumped on O'Connor's answer to the Pelosi question in the press, the National Republican Congressional Committee has yet to put money behind the exchange with a TV ad.

The committee, for example, began airing an ad on Tuesday that attacks O'Connor for supporting regulations that could increase energy prices, targeting senior voters.

"Danny O'Connor doesn't understand what it is like for folks like us," a senior citizen couple says in the spot airing in Columbus . "O'Connor supports regulations that could raise my energy costs 39%."

Not mentioned once in Republican ads: O'Connor's muddled answer on Pelosi.

Republicans have also not made defending the Republican-backed tax overhaul a central part of their closing message, despite the fact that national operatives have stressed the need for campaigns to sell the measure, which passed in December.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) A Republican congressman on Tuesday dismissed President Donald Trump's threat of shutting down the government over immigration as "posturing."

"I kind of see it as posturing, to be honest with you," Rep. Scott Taylor told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." "I've fought against the government shutdown last time over the 'Dream Act.' I'll fight against it this time as well."

Taylor added that he would oppose a shutdown over its effects on the military and other federal workers around the country.

"As you can see here in Virginia Beach, we have more military than any congressional district in the nation," Taylor said. "It would affect the military, our National Guard, our federal workers, government contractors, it's an irresponsible thing to do, I think. So I do not support it."

Trump surprised many congressional Republicans over the weekend when he threatened a government shutdown if Congress does not fund his border wall and change immigration laws. He reiterated the shutdown threat Monday in a news conference.

__label__politics (CNN) The biggest test of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election begins Tuesday with the trial of Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

The trial on Manafort's financial dealings will hang over the White House and show just how deeply federal authorities have looked into the private business of Trump associates.

It comes as the President continues to rail against Mueller's investigation, calling it a "witch hunt," and some congressional Republicans are looking to impeach the Justice Department official overseeing the Muller probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump weighed in on the Mueller probe Tuesday morning, reiterating a defense made by his attorney Rudy Giuliani that "collusion is not a crime," even though actions such as conspiracy can be criminal.

One year ago to the month, federal agents barged into Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, apartment under a search warrant. They took dozens of hanging file folders, bank statements, discs, memory cards and computer hard drives, and a watch worth several thousand dollars from the design house Bijan -- much of that evidence will be on display for the jury.

The trial in federal court i n Alexandria, Virginia, is expected to last three weeks. Jury selection will begin Tuesday, with opening arguments likely later this week. Manafort is also scheduled to face trial in Washington, DC, on related charges in September.

The case against Manafort doesn't focus on his time as chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016. Manafort is charged with 18 violations of tax and banking laws. Prosecutors claim he hid millions of dollars in income from lobbying for Ukrainian politicians, all while failing to pay taxes and spending the money on US real estate and personal luxury purchases.

When his Ukrainian political work dried up in 2015, prosecutors say Manafort lied to banks to take out more than $20 million in loans. They accuse him of hiding his foreign bank accounts from federal authorities. Manafort also allegedly received loans from the Federal Savings Bank after one of its executives sought a position in the Trump campaign and administration, prosecutors say.

If found guilty, Manafort could face a maximum sentence of 305 years in prison

Prosecutors have said publicly that possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign won't come up at trial. "I don't anticipate that a government witness will utter the word 'Russia,'" one prosecutor said earlier this month.

That hasn't kept the collusion question from seeping into the proceedings so far.

When the judge who will oversee the trial, Judge T.S. Ellis, first had a chance to meet with prosecutors and the defense in the case, he railed at the possibility that Mueller had skewered Manafort as a way to get to Trump.

"The vernacular is to sing," Ellis commented in May on one of Mueller's possible that perhaps investigators wanted Manafort to change his plea to guilty and agree to cooperate.

Prosecutors plan to call about 30 witnesses to testify against Manafort and show the jury hundreds of financial records, emails and photos. Five witnesses who wanted to avoid testifying have been given limited immunity in the case.

Manafort himself is unlikely to testify, lawyers who've watched the case say.

His attorneys are under a court order not to speak publicly about Manafort's legal issues and declined to comment for this story.

Manafort's tactics

His lawyers have spent the months since Manafort's indictment attempting to pick away at the prosecutors' case with almost no success. They've tried to cut away at the evidence Mueller collected and asked two courts to deny Mueller his power to bring the case. But two federal judges have left the cases against Manafort in place

Manafort also separately tried for months to lift the house arrest bail condition a judge placed him under in October. At the moment he looked set to succeed, prosecutors accused him of witness tampering, and a judge in DC federal court sent him to jail. He has been housed first at a jail in rural Virginia and now at the jail in Alexandria, since mid-June. The public has seen Manafort only a few times in court since his lock up, including twice last week when his lawyers earned from Ellis a one-week delay to the trial's start.

In the lead up to the trial, several defense lawyers who have watched the case as outsiders say Manafort's defense strategy has been unclear -- even nonexistent.

"I haven't seen any indication of the strategy," said James McGovern, a white-collar defense lawyer in New York who has no connection to the case but previously worked alongside one of Mueller's prosecutors, Greg Andres. "It seems to me [prosecutors will] have a great deal of paper that could lead to one inescapable conclusion."

Despite the suspected strength of prosecutors' case, Manafort expressed an air of calm confidence in private conversations before he went to jail in June.

"Paul believes that he'll be found not guilty of all of these charges. I do not know the details as to why," one friend said. "He believes in the end that he'll be vindicated."

Since June, Manafort told friends on a recorded phone line from jail he had reviewed all of the documents in his case.

Charlie Black -- one of Manafort's former business partners in the 1980s at the famed lobbying shop Black, Manafort & Stone -- said he hadn't spoken to Manafort recently, but in their prior conversations Manafort never wavered on his innocence. Stone is a reference to Roger Stone, who is also under Mueller scrutiny.

"It's tragic for him and his family," Black said. "I just hope that he's innocent." Black has not been called to testify in the upcoming trial.

The key witness

Prosecutors are expected to call to the stand former Manafort deputy Rick Gates as a key witness. Gates was originally indicted alongside Manafort, in both DC and Virginia, after prosecutors accused him of helping his longtime colleague lie to accountants, banks and the federal government.

Mueller's team dropped the case against Gates in Virginia after he changed his plea to guilty in the related case in DC and agreed to cooperate with investigators. Gates at the time said the pressure on his family, a "circus-like atmosphere" around the case and the legal bills contributed to his decision to flip.

With Gates positioned to testify against Manafort, the prosecutors are likely to weave some human drama into what appears to be a fairly straightforward financial case that largely will rely on a paper trail.

"This isn't a case with surprises in it. It's not even a surprise who your central cooperator is. [It] will be painfully boring to watch," McGovern said. "Gates is gravy at this point."
__label__politics (CNN) There's an old political cliche that goes like this: Presidents get too much credit when the economy is going well -- and too much blame when it's going poorly.

That cliche begets this political reality: When the economy is good and/or people believe the economy is good, a president is usually popular. And when the economy is weak (or perceived to be weak), a president is almost always struggling in the polls.

Which is why Donald Trump's current situation is super weird.

All current polling suggests that people not only feel good about the economy but give Trump credit for its success. In an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released last week, 50% of Americans approved of the job Trump was doing with the economy while only 34% disapproved. Those numbers on the economy were far better than how people said Trump was handling immigration (41% approve/51% disapprove) or the US relationship with Russia (26% approve/51% disapprove).

And yet, in that same NBC-WSJ poll, just 45% approved of Trump's performance as President overall while 52% disapproved.

The President's comments come one day before the government will allow online plans to be posted on the web following a settlement with gun-rights activists.

The gun rights lobbyist has no official statement on 3-D guns on its website, but last month, spokeswoman Dana Loesch said in an NRATV segment that Sen.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former White House legislative affairs director Marc Short predicted Tuesday that there will be a showdown at the end of the year over funding for President Donald Trump's wall he wants built at the US-Mexico border.

Short said that because September 30 marks the end of the fiscal year, Congress will likely pass a continuing resolution to fund the government, leaving the issue to come up again in December.

"It's been 22 years since Congress actually completed an appropriations process on time. They will likely fail again this year, which means they'll have a continuing resolution to punt this to December," Short, a CNN contributor, said on CNN's "New Day." "I think likely in December is when you'll see the showdown over funding for a wall."

Trump said Monday that he would " have no problem doing a shutdown ," following up on his tweet over the weekend in which he said he would be " willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall."

Congress passed a spending bill in March to fund the government through September 30.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump railed Tuesday against billionaire conservative brothers Charles and David Koch, accusing them of being against key components of his populist agenda and suggesting they're irrelevant in today's Republican Party.

Trump's public attack, following a weekend in which he was criticized at a Koch network summer meeting, comes amid speculation that the Koch brothers are reconsidering their typically full-throated support for Republican candidates during the midterm elections.

"The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas," Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. "They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more."

In a separate tweet, Trump argued that he "made them richer" and that the Koch network "is highly overrated."

"I have beaten them at every turn," Trump wrote of the Kochs. They want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed, I'm for America First & the American Worker - a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again!"

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump wants to give America's farmers $12 billion to shield them from losses in his global trade feuds. But if he bailed out every industry affected, it would cost more than triple that, a new report found.

Providing aid to all US sectors hurt by other countries' retaliatory tariffs would cost $39 billion, according to the US Chamber of Commerce.

Auto part manufacturers would receive $7.6 billion, and iron and steel producers would get $4.6 billion. An array of other industries — from fishing to furniture-making — would also need multimillion-dollar packages.

The chamber's analysis was prompted by the Trump administration's announcement last week that it would provide up to $12 billion in aid to certain farmers, dairy and pork producers.

Several key US trading partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, have levied tariffs on a variety of agricultural products in response to Trump administration tariffs on their exports.
__label__politics (CNN) The Trump administration plans to raise pending tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, a source familiar with discussions confirmed to CNN.

The news was first reported by Bloomberg.

The move, which is not finalized and could change, according to the source, comes as the United States and China remain locked in a trade war. Talks between US and Chinese officials have done little to ease tensions.

The United States has already imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion. China immediately responded with its own tariffs on US goods worth $34 billion.

A second round of tariffs on products worth $16 billion could take effect as soon as this week.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump bragged about a booming economy, touted his tough actions on international trade and lambasted Democrats for obstructing his agenda on Capitol Hill at a campaign rally Tuesday night in Tampa.

Trump was in Florida to endorse GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis for governor ahead of a late-August primary. Compared with past campaign rallies where he has veered off script, the President remained relatively on message Tuesday night about the economy -- an approach that could give Republicans in competitive races hope as Trump ramps up his political travel schedule ahead of November's midterm elections

He bragged about a soaring stock market, low unemployment rates and a drop in the trade deficit in the most recent quarter, though economists have said that latter figure could be artificially inflated by companies rushing to move products as trade wars on multiple fronts loom.

"The days of plundering American jobs and American wealth -- those days are over," Trump said.

He heaped praise on farmers, who have seen their access to some foreign markets curtailed as a result of retaliatory moves as Trump has sought to reverse a trade deficit with China, renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and restart trade talks with the European Union.

His administration recently announced a $12 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the tariffs triggered by his trade moves.

"I want to thank our farmers. Our farmers are true patriots because China and others have targeted ... our farmers. Not good. Not nice," Trump said. "And you know what our farmers are saying? 'It's OK. We can take it.' These are incredible people."

He also bragged that rural areas were "beautiful, Republican red" in the 2016 election.

Some of Trump's claims about the economy were exaggerated or inaccurate. He said US Steel is opening six new mills. But as a publicly traded company, US Steel is required to announce such changes and so far has not done so.

He also made false claims about the cost of moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump said at times in Tampa that the move cost $140,000 and $400,000.

However, the $400,000 figure was just the cost of security upgrades and a US Embassy plaque ahead of a ceremonial opening in May. The US government is planning to spend $21 million for a second phase of renovations that includes building an addition to the old consular building to accommodate embassy staff. And US officials have not ruled out the possibility of ultimately moving the US Embassy to an entirely different site, where a new embassy would be built.

In Tampa, Trump also alluded to the possibility of a government shutdown at the end of September, saying he "may have to do some pretty drastic things" to get funding for a wall.

"But we're going to get it," he said. "Cause the Democrats are not voting for what we want to do, and they're not voting and allowing our values to take place in our country."

Trump reiterated his calls for laws requiring voters to show photo identification. Largely Democratic critics of such laws say they risk disenfranchising elderly and urban voters who don't drive.

In doing so, he said buying groceries requires an ID.

"You know if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card. You need ID," Trump said.

The rally came at the beginning of a three-month sprint to the November midterm elections.

Trump is telling aides he wants to considerably step up the number of rallies he is holding, and his team is looking at ways to do just that, a source familiar with the President's thinking said Tuesday.

Trump is annoyed at the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller and concerned that it is allowing his opponents to chip away at his legitimacy as President.

But Trump is also concerned about the outcome of the midterms. He is nervous that the Democrats are going to take the House and stymie his agenda.

The source also said this frame of mind helps explain the President's renewed manic tweeting. "He is in worker mode," the source said.

Because of that, he is reacting as he often does and has his entire career. He is arguing that he must act himself -- that he wants to take things into his own hands, the source said.

However, while Trump could help Republicans in Senate races like North Dakota, Indiana and West Virginia, many of 2018's battlegrounds -- particularly in House races -- are in suburban areas where he is unpopular.

Still, he has been a force in recent weeks in GOP primaries.

Trump's first expressed support for DeSantis in December and more explicitly endorsed him with a tweet in June, launching him past former congressman and Florida agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam in the race to replace two-term GOP Gov. Rick Scott.

DeSantis, whose campaign has featured frequent guest appearances on Fox News, has clung closely to Trump in the campaign.

In a television ad touting Trump's endorsement that is narrated by his wife, DeSantis helps his toddler daughter "build the wall" and reads Trump's "The Art of the Deal" to his infant son. He teaches his daughter to read a "Make America Great Again" Trump sign, and the ad includes a shot of his son in a "Make America Great Again" onesie.

Trump, meanwhile, has seen the importance of his endorsement grow in GOP primaries after Alabama voters ignored him and chose Roy Moore over interim Sen. Luther Strange last year.

Two House candidates he backed -- Katie Arrington in South Carolina and Rep. Martha Roby in a runoff for her seat in Alabama -- both won. Then Trump-backed Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp crushed Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle in a Republican gubernatorial primary runoff last week.

Trump vanquished two of Florida's most famous GOP figures -- former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio -- in 2016's GOP presidential primary. Bush had dropped out by the time the Florida primary took place, and Trump won the state with 46% support to Rubio's second-place 27% showing.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) CNN's report that Michael Cohen claims then-candidate Donald Trump had advanced knowledge of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya with supposed "dirt" on Hillary Clinton has created a fresh wave of scrutiny about the now-infamous gathering.

Cohen's reported claims, if true, would be at odds with repeated denials that Trump was not told of the meeting beforehand, and raise the prospect that Trump Jr. lied to Congress about the meeting.

Three congressional committees have investigated the circumstances surrounding the Trump Tower meeting, and two of those -- the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee -- have either issued reports or released transcripts of their probes into the meeting.

The documents and testimony, as well as t he emails exchanged between Trump Jr. and British music publicist Rob Goldstone, provide a picture of what we know so far about the days surrounding the Trump Tower meeting -- and how Cohen's claims might fit into or upend that narrative.

Here's a day-by-day look at how the Trump Tower meeting happened:

June 3, 2016

Goldstone emails Trump Jr.: Rob Goldstone, the British music publicist, Rob Goldstone, the British music publicist, emails Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. , saying that Russian pop star Emin Agalarov had asked him to arrange a meeting in order to "provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."

Goldstone says the documents came from a meeting between the "Crown prosecutor of Russia" and Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov, Emin's father, and claims they are "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."

Trump Jr. responds: Trump Jr. responds to Goldstone's email approximately 20 minutes later, writing: "if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer."

June 6, 2016

Goldstone and Trump Jr. trade emails: Goldstone and Trump Jr. exchange emails to arrange a phone call between Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov, the pop star son of Aras Agalarov who helped arrange the meeting.

"Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary info -- you had mentioned early this week so wanted to try to schedule a time and day. Best to you and family," Goldstone writes.

"Rob could we speak now?" Trump Jr. responds later in the afternoon

"Let me track him down in Moscow," Goldstone responds.

After Trump Jr. provides his phone number, Goldstone writes: "Ok he's on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 minutes so I am sure can call."

Trump Jr. calls Emin Agalarov: Trump Jr.'s phone records show he received and then called a Russian number in the afternoon and evening, which Trump Jr. said was Emin Agalarov's number, according to the House Intelligence Committee Trump Jr.'s phone records show he received and then called a Russian number in the afternoon and evening, which Trump Jr. said was Emin Agalarov's number, according to the House Intelligence Committee Democratic report

Agalarov also called Trump Jr. back the following day, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee Democratic memo

Trump Jr., however, testified that he could not recall whether he spoke to Agalarov, suggesting they might have traded voice mails.

Trump Jr. calls a blocked number: Trump Jr.'s phone records also show a "blocked" number in between the two calls to Agalarov for four minutes, as well as an 11-minute call in the evening following the second Agalarov call, according to the Judiciary Committee Democratic report. Trump Jr. testified to the House Intelligence Committee he did not know who the number belonged to.

Democrats have speculated that the number could be Trump Jr.'s father, as committee Democrats noted in their report: "Corey Lewandowski told the Committee that Mr. Trump's "primary residence has a blocked [phone] line."

June 7, 2016

Trump Jr. and Goldstone confirm the meeting: The meeting is confirmed for June 9 at 3 p.m. between Trump Jr. and Goldstone. Trump Jr. emails Goldstone after the meeting is confirmed that the attendees "will likely be Paul Manafort my brother in law and me."

Trump previews speech on Clintons: Trump secures the Republican nomination and makes remarks following the evening's primaries in which he previewed a speech against the Clintons. "I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons," Trump said. "I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting."

Longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks testified to the House Intelligence Committee that Trump's planned speech was not a reflection of knowledge about the upcoming Trump Tower meeting, but rather was about "an outline of the book Clinton Cash." She said he gave the speech roughly two weeks later than planned because it was delayed by a domestic terrorist attack, according to the House Intelligence Committee Republican report

June 8, 2016

Meeting time is adjusted: Goldstone emails Trump Jr. to ask if the meeting can be pushed back an hour to 4 p.m. Trump Jr. forwarded the entire email exchange to Manafort and Kushner, adding, "meeting got moved to 4 tomorrow at my offices."

Other notable events ahead of the meeting on June 9, 2016

Trump is told about the meeting, Cohen later claims: Trump Jr. tells his father about the planned meeting with the Russians, according to Trump's former fixer and attorney Michael Cohen, who claims he was in the room when it happened, CNN reported last week. Trump gave the go-ahead for his son to meet with the Russians, Trump Jr. tells his father about the planned meeting with the Russians, according to Trump's former fixer and attorney Michael Cohen, who claims he was in the room when it happened, CNN reported last week. Trump gave the go-ahead for his son to meet with the Russians, according to Cohen's account . Trump denies that he knew about the meeting beforehand and says he learned about it one year after it occurred.

After CNN reported last week Cohen's claims that Trump knew about the meeting, Trump Jr. and Trump both deny Cohen's account. "I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr.," Trump tweets . "Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?)."

Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Monday that he heard from reporters about another meeting that took place around this same time. This meeting was supposedly attended by six people -- including Trump Jr., Kushner and then-Trump campaign official Rick Gates -- to talk strategy for the upcoming liaison with the Russians. Giuliani, though, claims he raised the meeting in television interviews to refute that it ever happened.

Trump Jr. says he does not discuss the meeting with his father: Trump Jr. testifies to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not discuss the Trump Tower meeting with his father:

Q: "Did you inform your father about the meeting or the underlying offer prior to the meeting?"

Trump Jr: "No, I did not."

Kaveladze emails Agalarov associate: At some point before the meeting, Ike Kaveladze, who was the Agalarov representative at the meeting, told the House Intelligence Committee that he emailed Roman Beniaminov, an associate of Agalarov in the US, to ask about the purpose of the meeting. The specific date is not known, but Kaveladze testified Beniaminov wrote that he "believed the scheduled meeting at Trump Tower was about providing negative information on candidate Clinton to the Trump campaign," according to the Republican House Intelligence Committee report.

June 9, 2016

Russians huddle before the meeting: The Russian group meets for lunch before the meeting, in which Veselnitskaya shares a document with a synopsis of what she will discuss. The summary contains much of the same information as a similar document reportedly shared with Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, according to the House Intelligence Republican report.

Trump holds a fundraiser: The day of the Trump Tower meeting, The day of the Trump Tower meeting, Trump holds a fundraiser at the Four Seasons Hotel two blocks from Trump Tower. The event is his first fundraiser with the Trump Victory Fund, where Trump meets for lunch with dozens of top Republican donors to discuss the general election.

Trump returns to Trump Tower roughly three hours before the meeting with Veselnitskaya and his son is scheduled to begin, where he remains for the rest of the afternoon.

Goldstone checks in: Goldstone meets up with Veselnitskaya and the others before going to Trump Tower. As he arrives, Goldstone checks into Trump Tower on Facebook, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Trump Tower meeting occurs: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort meet at Trump Tower with Goldstone, Veselnitskaya, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, Agalarov business associate Kaveladze and translator Anatoli Samochornov.

According to participants' testimony, the meeting lasted about 20 minutes, and the promise of "dirt" never materialized, as Veselnitskaya focused her presentation on sanctions against Russia under the Magnitsky Act, which was later portrayed as discussing "adoptions."

Veselnitskaya briefly mentions information about an alleged Russian tax fraud scheme involving Ziff Brothers Investments and British investor William Browder that was connected to Democrats, but it wasn't the dirt that was expected.

Akhmetshin told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Trump Jr. asked, "So can you show us how does this money go to Hillary?" and he requested proof or paperwork that she did not have.

Trump Jr. explained the meeting this way his House Intelligence Committee testimony:

MR. SCHIFF: Right. How much of the time was spent discussing that [the Magnitsky Act], and how much of the time was spent discussing dirt on Secretary Clinton?

MR. TRUMP JR.: Again, the majority was really split up between -- really started off as Russian adoption, which was sort of the, you know, what I perceive to be sort of the feelgood segue to probably lobbying for something as it related to that Act. So, you know, I'd say we spent less than, you know, 5 minutes of the 20 minutes, again, speaking through a translator about the quote/unquote "dirt", and the rest was a quick segue, bait-and-switch, whatever you want to call it, to speak about Russian adoption and the Magnitsky Act.

According to attendees, Trump Jr. asked for the incriminating information on Clinton but did not receive it:

MR. SCHIFF: And do you recall Don Jr. asking whether Veselnitskaya had anything on Hillary Clinton?

MR. KAVELADZE: Yes.

Goldstone apologizes to Trump Jr.: After the meeting concludes, Goldstone testified that he apologized to Trump Jr. for the "bait-and-switch," according to the House Intelligence GOP report.

Russians convene at Trump Tower bar: According to House Intelligence Democrats, the Russians head to the Trump Tower bar immediately after the meeting. While going over what occurred, Veselnitskaya "expressed her dissatisfaction," Kaveladze testified to the House panel.

Trump tweets about Clinton's missing emails: At 4:40 p.m., 40 minutes after the Trump Tower meeting was scheduled to begin, Trump responds to Clinton's tweet telling him to "delete your account" by asking Clinton about her "missing" emails.

"How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?" Trump tweets

Calling the Agalarovs: Kaveladze leaves the bar after a few minutes to take a call from Agalarov to discuss the meeting, according to the Democratic report. He tells Agalarov that the meeting was a "complete loss of time and about nothing," according to the GOP report.

Goldstone also spoke to Emin Agalarov after the meeting, he told the Senate Judiciary panel, and said he told him it was "the most embarrassing thing you've ever asked me to do. I've just sat in a meeting about adoption."

He said Agalarov replied: "Adoption?" — which could imply Agalarov didn't anticipate that to be the topic of the meeting.

Another call to blocked number: Two hours after the meeting, Trump Jr. places another call to a blocked number, according to the Democratic Senate Judiciary memo.

Aras Agalarov sends Trump a gift: Aras Agalarov sends Trump an expensive painting for his birthday, according to the House Intelligence Democratic report.

June 14, 2016

Goldstone sends along 'eerily weird' news: Five days after the Trump Tower meeting, there were news reports that Russians were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails.

Goldstone sends a news article on the hacking to Emin Agalarov and Kaveladze, according to the Democratic report, and states: "Top story right now -- seems eerily weird based on our Trump meeting last week with the Russian lawyers etc."

June 17, 2016

Trump sends Agalarov a thank you letter: A week after the gift is sent, Trump sends a thank you letter to Agalarov: "There are few things better than receiving a sensational gift from someone you admire -- and that's what I've received from you. You made my birthday a truly special event by your thoughtfulness -- not to mention your remarkable talent. I'm rarely at a loss for words, but right now I can only say how much I appreciate your friendship and to thank you for this fantastic gift. This is one birthday that I will always remember."
__label__world (CNN) The Tajikistan government Tuesday blamed an attack that killed four foreign cyclists, including two Americans, on a banned political opposition group.

The Interior Ministry issued a statement attributing Sunday's attack to the Islamic Renaissance Party, known as IRP or IRPT.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that IRPT leader-in-exile Muhiddin Kabiri denied and condemned the attack.

Seven cyclists from the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France were set upon in a vehicle by several "terrorists" acting for the IRPT, the ministry said. Two Americans, a Dutch national and a Swiss national were killed in the attack and three other cyclists were injured.

The ministry said during its investigation, authorities killed four suspected attackers. Spokesman Umarjon Emomali said more than three attackers were captured.

__label__world (CNN) New Zealand's transport authority will scrap a sexist road sign after a seven-year-old girl complained that they indicated only men could work on roadside power lines.

Zoe Carew raised the issue after seeing "Lineman" signs warning that power cables were being modified or fixed, pointing out that women could be doing the job.

"I think this sign is wrong and unfair. Do you agree?" Carew wrote in a letter to Fergus Gammie, the chief executive of New Zealand's Transport Agency (NZTA)

So proud of my 7yo. She recently wrote to the NZTA CE asking that they replace the 'Lineman' sign with something more "correct and fair" bc "women can be line-workers too". The CE agreed and now NZTA is developing a new Line Crew sign. High 5s all round! 😍 pic.twitter.com/lam5tciZ2u — Caitlin Carew (@greeniecaitlin) July 30, 2018

Although Carew expressed no interest in becoming a line worker "because there are so many more exciting things," she was outraged on behalf of all women.

She asked for a change in the signs to say "LINE-WORKERS" or "something correct and fair like that".

__label__world (CNN) Thousands of supporters gathered Wednesday in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo to welcome former warlord Jean-Pierre-Bemba on his return to the country.

Bemba, 55, a former vice-president of the country arrived from Belgium after spending more than ten years in prison in the Hague for war crimes. His conviction was overturned in June by the International Criminal Court.

A large crowd of his supporters wearing T-shirts, hats and scarves emblazoned with his face met him at the airport as he arrived via private jet from Belgium.

Police in his envoy fired tear gas to disperse his supporters to allow Bemba's convoy to speed past, as they drove from Kinshasa airport to the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) party headquarters where he was swamped by party supporters, according to media reports

Bemba, who led the MLC party before his arrest, became one of the country's four vice presidents in 2003.
__label__world (CNN) China is using a massive international military competition as "a marketing and advertising show" to sell its weapons and military goods, as the country seeks to solidify its place as one of the world's largest arms exporters.

The Chinese component of the International Army Games kicked off Sunday in the country's remote far western province of Xinjiang. The exercises, which will run until August 11, with a separate amphibious event in coastal province of Fujian, bring together military representatives from across the world.

According to Chinese state media, the countries involved in the games will use Chinese or Russian-made military equipment for many of the competitions, giving them an opportunity to try before they buy.

"It's a chance for China to flex its military might to the world. In turn, that will help drive Chinese commercial opportunities," said Nick Marro, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.

Infantry fighting vehicle from China competes in the Suvorov Attack Race as part of the International Army Games 2018 on July 30 in Korla, Xinjiang.

The Chinese government is among world leaders in weapons exports, trailing only the US, Russia, France and Germany, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute

Information provided by the Institute shows that between 2008 and 2017, China sold more than $14 billion in arms to governments overseas, including more than $1 billion in the last year.

Top Chinese military customers including Pakistan and Bangladesh are taking part in this year's exercises, as well as other buyers such as Myanmar and Iran.

Activists have pointed out many countries buying China's weapons have notorious human rights records, including political repression, mass corruption and ethnic cleansing.

Key customers

In an article republished on the Chinese military's official People's Liberation Army news site, Chinese military expert Song Zhongping said the games were a "marketing and advertising show for military industrial products."

Pakistan, which will be taking part in the land and air exercises in Xinjiang, is the biggest customer for Chinese arms, with more than a third of Beijing's military exports in 2017 going to Islamabad.

Some of their purchases are among China's most high-tech, including tracking systems for nuclear missiles and joint development of the JF-17 jet fighter, according to a report from the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Venezuela, which bought an undisclosed number of C-802 anti-ship missiles from China in 2017, will take part in the Seaborne Assault competitions in Fujian.

China is also hoping to attract potential purchasers from other neighboring countries taking part in the competition.

The event was founded by Russia and co-organized by China . This year's exercises will be held in seven different countries around the world over the course of the two weeks.

The majority of events will take place in Russia with a few held in China and Kazakhstan. Belarus, Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia will each host a single competition.

At the opening ceremony for the army games in Russia, People's Liberation Army tanks, rocket launchers and helicopters were used during live fire sections.

During the Russia portions of the competition, Chinese H-6k bombers, J-10A fighter jets and Type 96B main battle tanks will be on display.

Diplomatic leverage

Experts say the event's real benefit to China isn't derived from arms sales, but in diplomatic gains.

"China is using arms exports as an instrument of its foreign policy to create strategic dependencies," Michael Raska, a military studies professor at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore said in a podcast last year.

"They are not motivated by profit, they are motivated to align (others) with Chinese foreign policy."

Sales of China's arms to Asian countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh increase its influence in the region because they become dependent on Beijing to service military hardware.

But Chinese arms sales to more distant countries, such as Venezuela or Iran, are used as a way to rile the United States, said Raska.
__label__world (CNN) China's north plain, one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, is set to become the world's deadliest heatwave zone by the end of the century, scientists say.

New scientific research suggests that unless there are heavy cuts in carbon emissions, climate change will lead to humid heatwaves that could push the area "against the boundaries of habitability" by 2070.

The results of the study of China's northern plain, which includes the capital Beijing, are particularly worrying because many of the region's 400 million people are farmers exposed to climactic conditions.

The study said that heat and high humidity can create conditions that kill even healthy people within six hours of being outside.

"This spot is going to be the hottest spot for deadly heatwaves in the future," said Professor Elfatih Eltahir , at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who led the new study.

A government video shows Duterte watching on as a bulldozer crushes 76 smuggled cars and motorbikes, including models by Lamborghini, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.

The vehicles, which were destroyed Monday, were all part of a haul of 800 illegally imported into the Philippines, a government press statement said.

This is not the first time that Duterte has cheered on the destruction of luxury vehicles. In February, he ordered the destruction of 30 luxury cars, saying selling confiscated cars at auction would allow crime syndicates to bid for them under false identities.

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) At 93, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is the oldest leader in the world. In May, he made a stunning return to political power, he says in a bid to save his corruption-plagued country before it's too late.

Mahathir was once at the helm of the country for 22 years from 1981 to 2003, becoming Malaysia's longest-serving Prime Minister. In that time, he was credited with transforming Malaysia from an agrarian society to an industrialized nation. In the process, he ruled the country with an iron fist -- locking up political opponents and censoring the press.

CNN's Talk Asia sat down with the elder statesman at the Prime Minister's Office outside the capital of Kuala Lumpur.

CNN: Prime Minister, you came out of retirement to run again for political office. Why this comeback at such a late stage in life?

MM: Well, when I stepped down voluntarily, I thought that I would have a very relaxed time, be with my family and maybe cruise around. Unfortunately, the moment I stepped down, my successor decided to change course, adopted new policies and all that. And particularly discarded everything that I have started. So, a lot of people felt unhappy. They all came to see me, asking me "Please, do something, please do something."

'We should be treated as equal with anybody else'

CNN: How did politics come into your life?

MM: We were under the British rule and then the Japanese came in, conquered us and then the Japanese gave our country to the Thais, to the Siamese people. So it looks as if we are just a football that can be kicked around by anybody. I didn't like that. I felt that people don't respect us. I felt that we should be treated as equal with anybody else.

So that is what drove me, that Malaysia can be as good as any other country. I was born here, brought up here and these people around me are the people I have lived with all this time and we have developed a way of life that we cherish.

CNN: In your first term, your critics labeled you authoritarian, a dictator. I know in the past you've denied that. Does it take a strong man to move a developing country, an emerging country into the developed world?

MM: I was not a dictator, I was elected five times by the people, and no dictator has ever resigned; I resigned. But I thought that the opportunity to work and deliver certain things for the country was something very satisfying. It is not the money that you earn, it is job satisfaction.

I traveled a lot to many countries and other countries are doing well, why shouldn't Malaysia? So it is a matter of analyzing our assets, our liabilities, our situation and coming up with some designs that can contribute towards the advancement of this country.

CNN: Do you have any regrets from your first term?

MM: No, not much of a regret but I felt that this country is a multi-racial country. You cannot change that, and that is something that I tried to do because I don't like disparities between rich and poor, between races, because that will destabilize the country.

I tried to ensure that the disparities were diminished, so that all the races enjoy the wealth of this country together. I had little success but generally I failed. I wish I had [done more], but you know, you can't change people's way of life, culture, mindsets and all that overnight. I will try again.

'I suppose I fell in love with her'

CNN: You met your wife, Tun Siti Hasmah, while studying medicine in university. What first attracted you to her?

MM: Actually there were not many girls in those days and she was the only girl taking the medical course who was a Malay. So naturally we gravitated towards the only girl in the group and eventually, well, I suppose I fell in love with her. In those days, not many women went to the university, and she was determined to get a university education. That, I think reflects her strength of character.

CNN: You two have been married for 62 years now. What's your secret?

MM: We learn to tolerate each other. Initially, of course, we quarreled quite often. I am very strict about time and all that and she takes a lot of time, is late and all that. We used to quarrel over that but I realized that I could not change her and she could not change me, so we accepted that we are different.

She feels in the same way about the kind of things that I believe in -- about loyalty, the country, about working for the country and all that. She accompanies me wherever I go and she is, in a sense, quite as dedicated to this idea of loyalty, patriotism that I have.

CNN: You are 93 years old, yet you're turning up for work every day, you're running a country, you're traveling the world. Where does your endurance come from?

MM: Well, chronological age is 93, biological age need not be 93. Sometimes people are younger than their age. I lead a very moderate life. I don't do anything in excess. I don't eat food until I get fat and that kind of thing I don't do. I do get sick sometimes, you know, I have had two heart operations and all that but I look after my health generally.

To keep the mind active you need to read, you need to think, you need to argue. That is very important because like the muscle, which becomes weak and regress if you don't use your muscle, the brain is also like that. If you stop thinking, you just dream along and don't study, don't read, don't solve problems and all that, then the brain will lose its capacity to think and to function.

'The Islam of the Koran is a very moderate Islam'

CNN: You are the leader of a moderate, mostly Muslim nation and in 2003, you called on Islam to evolve. Has it?

MM: Well, the Islam that you see today is not actually the Islam that is taught by the religion. It is the Islam interpreted by certain powerful people, leaders, scholars and all that. We find that it is quite different from the original teachings of Islam as found in the Koran. So we feel that the Islam of the Koran is a very moderate Islam. It doesn't preach war, it calls upon all Muslim to be brothers. It forbids killing; well, we are doing all those things which are forbidden by Islam. So, it is the interpretation of the religion that has got us into that world state.

CNN: So in your opinion, it is these interpretations that are running your religion?

MM: Yes. Somebody comes along, becomes a very popular leader and he interprets in his own way -- that you should fight, you should kill, you should be opposed to people of other religions. Even among yourselves, you don't accept people who have other interpretations. All these things have resulted in instability, even in conflicts and civil wars, and also wars within nations.

CNN: Finally Prime Minister, how do you want people to remember you?

MM: I have this belief that once you are not around, lots of people will debunk everything and they will say nasty things about you. To me, that is not important. I will not be around to hear that.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) I've written -- a lot -- about how the most enduring legacy of Donald Trump's presidency, whether it lasts four years or eight years, is his unapologetic assault on facts and the idea of truth. We have simply never had a president who says as many things that aren't true as Donald Trump. Or a president who, once it's clear what he's saying isn't accurate, takes such pleasure in repeating falsehoods.

Which brings me to The Washington Post Fact Checker's running count of how many things Trump has said -- since being sworn in on January 20, 2017, that are either misleading or totally untrue. And to these two sentences in particular: "As of day 558, he's made 4,229 Trumpian claims — an increase of 978 in just two months. That's an overall average of nearly 7.6 claims a day."

The President of the United States is saying more than seven things that aren't true a day. SEVEN.

averaging -- 16 falsehoods a day. (As a thought experiment, try to lie -- or misrepresent -- 16 times tomorrow. I bet you can't.) And, what's more, his tendency toward untruth is actually picking up steam. As WaPo's Glenn Kessler Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly note, Trump was averaging less than five false or misleading claims in his first 100 days. (Only five!) But, between June and July Trump is averaging ---- 16 falsehoods a day. (As a thought experiment, try to lie -- or misrepresent -- 16 times tomorrow. I bet you can't.)

It's not just the raw numbers either. Trump has ramped up his disdain and dismissiveness of all forms of communication that don't originate with him. "Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening," Trump said earlier this month. "Just stick with us, don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news." On Tuesday, at a campaign rally in Tampa, Florida, Trump said: "You know, polls are fake, just like everything else."

__label__politics Honolulu, Hawaii (CNN) It was a homecoming 60 years in the making on Wednesday for Americans lost in the Korean War.

On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence greeted 55 flag-draped cases of what are believed to be the remains of American service members killed in the war during a ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu.

Pence looked on solemnly with his hand over his heart as the long, narrow boxes were gently laid on the stanchions in front of him.

Several dozen pallbearers -- representing the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines -- unloaded two cases at a time from two C-17 military aircraft parked on the tarmac. With ceremonial music in the background, the crowd gathered in the hangar rose as each wave of remains passed.

The vice president spoke for a few minutes before the ceremony began, calling it "tangible progress in our efforts to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula."

"I know President Trump is grateful that Chairman Kim kept his word, and we see today as tangible progress in our efforts to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula," Pence said. "But today is just a beginning. And our work will not be complete until all our fallen heroes are accounted for. We will see to it that these are the heroes who will lead the way to many homecomings in the future."

Pence described to reporters on Air Force Two on Tuesday what it meant to him personally to be speaking at the ceremony. He called the voyage "deeply meaningful" and said he was honored that President Donald Trump had asked him to attend.

Transfer cases believed to contain the remains of Americans killed in the Korean War arrive at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii on Wednesday.

"My father was a combat veteran in Korea. And as I said to them, my father, anytime the war came up and anyone used the word 'hero,' my dad would say, the heroes were the ones that didn't come home. So, to be able to be with them and the sacrifice their families have made to defend our freedom, to defend the freedom of South Korea, (I'm) just very humbled," he said.

Two family members of Americans missing in action in North Korea during the Korean War, Diana Brown Sanfilippo and Rick Downes, flew with the vice president on Air Force Two for the event.

Sanfilippo's father disappeared when she was 4 years old and she was inspired later in life to learn to fly the same kind of P-51 plane that her father was in when hit by ground fire over North Korea. Downes' father left for the Korean War as a radar operator on a B-26 bomber when Downes was 3 years old and he never returned. Downes went to North Korea in 2016 to press for the return of his father's and many other American's remains missing in action in North Korea.

People listen at a ceremony marking the arrival of the remains believed to be of American service members killed in the Korean War at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.

Pence concluded his remarks by welcoming home the fallen.

"And to our honored dead, who gave the last full measure of devotion for their families, our freedom, our future, our country -- to those whose memories we have cherished, though they fell so long ago -- and to these great American heroes, who were lost, and now are found -- today, as a nation, we breathe a word of thanks for your service and your sacrifice -- and we say to you, as one people, with one voice ... Welcome home," Pence said.

The remains are being repatriated as part of a historic agreement last month between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. During their meeting in Singapore, the first ever between sitting leaders of their respective countries, both Kim and Trump committed to recovering the remains of US service members who died during the Korean War and whose bodies were never found.

Military members carry transfer cases from a C-17 at a ceremony marking the arrival of the remains believed to be of American service members killed in the Korean War at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii on Wednesday.

Trump addressed the mission during a rally in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday night, saying "our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil."

It was the second of two ceremonies for possible remains being returned performed by the US military, according to the Department of Defense, after an earlier repatriation ceremony in Osan, South Korea.

In some ways, the work has just begun. The 55 cases of remains will be examined by historians and scientists at a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency laboratory on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, according to a United Nations news release. The laboratory uses forensic anthropology, odontology, DNA and other scientific methods to identify remains.
__label__politics (CNN) The special election race in Ohio's 12th Congressional District between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O'Connor appears to be going right down to the wire.

A Monmouth University poll released Wednesday shows Balderson receiving 44% support and O'Connor pulling 43% with 11% of respondents saying they are undecided. That's a shift from a little over a month ago, when Monmouth found Balderson leading O'Connor by 10 points.

Tuesday's election in central Ohio is the final test for the parties to gauge where they are in advance of the November midterm elections.

The poll comes just days before President Donald Trump heads to central Ohio on Saturday to stump for Balderson. The trip appears to be an attempt to fire up the Republican base, but Democrats close to O'Connor's campaign hope it will also spur Democratic excitement and turn off Republicans wary of Trump. The President's approval in the district stands at 46% with 49% saying they disapprove of his job performance.

Independent voters look to be boosting O'Connor's prospects, backing the Democrat over Balderson by a 48% to 32% margin -- with 17% undecided. That's a swing from the 33% to 30% split in favor of Balderson in June, when 33% were undecided.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Wednesday evening described the 2017-18 term as "much more divisive than usual."

The term as a whole was "momentous" and filled with "far more than the usual number of high-profile disputes," the 85-year-old Ginsburg, whose career on the Supreme Court spans more than two decades, said at a Washington event hosted by Duke University.

Ginsburg expressed a "hope" that the high court return to its "usual" rates of divisiveness next term.

Ginsburg said that while she and her fellow justices share a "collegiality," that kinship has faded from Congress.

"You don't see that kind of friendship existing in Congress anymore," she said. "You might recall that when I was nominated by President Clinton, the (confirmation) vote was 96-3. It's not that way anymore."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican senators are fighting back against President Donald Trump's Wednesday morning tweet asking that Attorney General Jeff Sessions end the special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said Sessions doesn't have the authority to end the probe but added the "President is entitled to speak his mind."

"I think that's out of Jeff Sessions' hands," he said. "He's recused himself from the Russian investigation so he really doesn't have any power to stop the Manafort prosecution. It's in court, the jury's been selected and it's going forward."

Trump on Wednesday said Sessions should end Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, arguing that the ongoing probe is hurting the United States.

Although the President has repeatedly criticized the investigation and Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing it, Trump's tweet that his attorney general "should stop" the probe is notable and raises fresh questions about whether the President is attempting to obstruct justice.

__label__politics Officials unveiled a final rule that will make it easier to obtain coverage through short-term health insurance plans, which don't have to adhere to the law's consumer protections.

The move would reverse an Obama administration decision to limit the duration of short-term plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive. Insurers will soon be allowed to sell these policies for just under a year. They can be renewed for up to 36 months, though that renewal isn't guaranteed.

Administration officials say the short-term plans will provide a cheaper health insurance alternative for those who can't afford to buy coverage on the Obamacare exchanges.

"We fully recognize that these products are not necessarily for everyone, but we do think they will provide an affordable option to many, many people who've been priced out of the current market under the Obamacare regulations," said Randy Pate, a deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

But patient advocates and health policy experts argue that these policies provide only skimpy coverage and will undermine the Affordable Care Act. Other actions the administration has taken this year include making it easier for small businesses to band together to buy coverage and slashing support for a program that helps people sign up for Obamacare.

Short-term plans could roil the Obamacare market by drawing healthier consumers away from the exchanges and pushing up the premiums for those who remain.

The plans, which have been available for years and were originally designed to fill a temporary gap in coverage, will likely be cheaper than Obamacare policies. But that's because they are allowed to exclude those with pre-existing conditions and base rates on an applicant's medical history, unlike Obamacare plans.

Have you ever had a short-term insurance policy? What was your experience? Tell us about it here. here

Also, short-term plans don't have to offer comprehensive coverage. Typically, they don't provide free preventative care or maternity, prescription drugs and mental health benefits.

They can also impose annual or lifetime limits, meaning they may only pay out a set amount -- often $1 million or less -- leaving the policyholder on the hook for the rest. And, unlike Obamacare policies, they don't have to cap consumers' cost-sharing burden at $7,350 for 2018.

Young and healthy folks may like these plans because they come with lower monthly premiums. Some people who don't qualify for Obamacare premium subsidies could pay 50% to 80% less for a short-term plan than for one on the exchange, according to the administration.

But those who actually need care could find themselves having to pay more out of pocket for treatment and medications. In fact, some consumers with these plans have complained that they've been hit with unexpected expenses.

Loosening Obamacare's rules protecting those with pre-existing conditions also risks a backlash from the public since these protections are among the health reform law's most popular provisions. Three-quarters of respondents to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll said it is "very important" that Obamacare's rule prohibiting insurers from denying coverage due to a person's medical history remains law, while nearly that many feel the same way about banning insurers from charging sick people higher rates.

The administration's short-term plan proposal was widely criticized by patient advocacy and hospital industry groups, saying it could leave people without coverage when they get sick. The two major insurance industry associations also expressed concerns about expanding the availability of these plans. In April comments to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the insurer groups said that doing so could destabilize the individual market and cause premiums to rise for those who want comprehensive coverage.

"Congress, the Administration, and the states should work to stabilize the individual market -- not simply create a parallel market that works only for healthy people," wrote the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a national federation of 36 independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans.

Administration officials said that the plans will contain notices urging consumers to read their policies carefully so they understand what is covered and what isn't. The notice will say that these plans do not meet Obamacare's minimum essential coverage requirements, meaning policyholders will be considered uninsured and will not be able to switch to a plan on the exchange outside of Obamacare's open enrollment period. And it will let consumers know that there may be provisions such as dollar limits on benefits.

"These policies are different from those offered on the exchange," said James Parker, senior advisor to Health Secretary Alex Azar. "We make no representation that it's equivalent coverage. These policies will not necessarily cover the same benefits or extend coverage to the same degree."

Short-term plans are also very profitable for insurers -- more than one-third of the premiums people pay goes toward overhead and profit instead of paying for policyholders' health care, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Insurers in the individual market aren't allowed to spend more than 20% on these expenses.

The Trump administration estimates that only up to 200,000 Obamacare enrollees will leave because of the changes to short-term plans. But other projections run far higher -- the Urban Institute predicts 2.2 million fewer people will enroll in Affordable Care Act-compliant plans when short-term plans become more widely available.

The new rule stems from an executive order President Donald Trump signed in October aimed at boosting competition, giving consumers more choices and lowering premiums.

That order also spurred the administration to issue a final rule last month aimed at making health insurance cheaper for some small employers. The move allows small businesses and the self-employed to join together based on their industry or location and purchase health insurance through association health plans

However, these plans also don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. These plans would likely have lower premiums, but they would also provide fewer benefits -- which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. Also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.
__label__politics (CNN) The US military is weighing significantly drawing down the number of US Special Operations Forces in Africa despite senior military officials warning that the terrorist threat in Africa is increasing, three defense officials tell CNN.

The planned reductions are intended to help better align the US military's posture with the Trump administration's new defense strategy which focuses more on near-peer competitors like Russia and China as opposed to counterterrorism missions.

US Africa Command, which oversees US troops on the continent, has submitted to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a plan to significantly reduce the number of US forces in Africa, the majority of which work to help countries there battle terrorist groups.

It is not clear whether Secretary of Defense James Mattis will approve the proposal.

"No decisions or changes have been made yet to the forces operating in Africa," Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Sheryll Klinkel told CNN.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's tweet Wednesday calling on his attorney general, Jeff Sessions to end special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference came as his lawyers continue to haggle with the special counsel about the parameters of a potential presidential interview.

On Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, Trump's lawyers updated him by phone on the latest developments, one person familiar with the matter told CNN. That included Mueller's latest proposal to secure an interview with Trump , which was delivered on Tuesday. Trump tweeted at Sessions hours after being updated by his legal team.

Although the President has repeatedly criticized the investigation and Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing it, Trump's tweet that his attorney general "should stop" the probe is notable and raises fresh questions about whether the President is attempting to obstruct justice.

"This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!" the President tweeted.

..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!

People inside the White House said the burst of tweets reflected the anger Trump has aired privately for months, including about Sessions. Trump has been more frustrated since headlines about his former attorney Michael Cohen emerged last week. Aides say they're working to schedule more political rallies, partly to boost Trump's mood and distract him from the headlines about Russia.

Trump talks to supporters

Trump has heard from top allies that he should be more outspoken about Sessions, even as Trump remains wary of firing him, people familiar with the conversations say.

On Tuesday night, Trump flew back from Florida with former aides who have stoked his anger and impulses in the past: current campaign manager Brad Parscale and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Earlier this summer, Parscale tweeted that Trump should fire Sessions in order to bring the Mueller probe to an end. A person on the flight says Trump spent most of his time with them in the air.

The Justice Department declined to comment on Trump's tweet Wednesday. Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, attempted to walk back the tweet early Wednesday afternoon, telling CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was "expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech. He said 'should' not 'must' and no Presidential order was issued or will be."

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders echoed that interpretation, telling reporters Trump "wants to see it come to an end as he has stated many times and we look forward to that happening."

She added, "The President is not obstructing. He's fighting back."

Although CNN has reported that several members of Mueller's team have donated to Democrats, Russia's interference in the 2016 election has also been the subject of several Republican-led congressional inquiries. Mueller is a Republican who was appointed as FBI director by President George W. Bush, and the man who tapped him as special counsel, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, was named by Trump and is also a registered Republican.

Last year, Sessions recused himself from any investigation related to the 2016 presidential campaigns soon after it came to light that he had failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation hearing contacts with Russia's ambassador to Washington. After he stepped aside, Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to look into Russian interference, including whether any Trump campaign officials coordinated with Moscow.

Raises obstruction questions

A central focus of Mueller's probe is whether Trump has obstructed justice in the Russia investigation, and Wednesday's tweet could be scrutinized by the special counsel's team. Citing three people briefed on the matter, The New York Times reported last month that Mueller is reviewing Trump's tweets as well as "negative statements" made by the President related to the attorney general and former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump abruptly fired last year.

California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, raised the question on Twitter Wednesday shortly after Trump's remark.

"The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated," Schiff wrote. "This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it."

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called the tweet "highly inappropriate" and dismissed the possibility that Mueller is going to be fired.

"It would be far better if the President refrained from commenting and for Mr. Mueller to continue his investigation, which so far already has 30 indictments, including Russian nationalists," she said on Capitol Hill.

The President has escalated his attacks on the Mueller probe in recent days, and his tweet on Wednesday comes on the second day of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's trial, the first case Mueller's team has taken before a jury. Manafort is facing charges of bank fraud and tax evasion, though his alleged crimes occurred before he was involved with the Trump campaign.

Trump brought up Manafort by name in a second tweet on Wednesday, saying that he has worked in the past for "highly prominent and respected political leaders," and that the charges against him "have nothing to do with Collusion," which he referred to as "a Hoax!" In another tweet on Wednesday, Trump wrote, "Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX."

Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018

Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign colluded with Russia. He has repeatedly criticized Sessions for recusing himself and CNN has previously reported that Trump pressured the attorney general on multiple occasions to overturn his recusal.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard is expected to soon begin a major naval exercise that could demonstrate its ability to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial conduit for global energy supplies, US officials say.

The exercise in the Persian Gulf could begin as soon as the next two days, according to two US officials directly familiar with the latest assessment of the Revolutionary Guard's troop movements.

"We are aware of the increase in Iranian naval operations within the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman. We are monitoring it closely, and will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways," Capt. William Urban, chief spokesman for US Central Command, told CNN.

The Strait of Hormuz links the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. The US Energy Information Administration calls it "the world's most important oil transit chokepoint," with 20% of oil traded worldwide moving through the waterway, which is about 30 miles wide at its narrowest point.

While the US sees no immediate signs of hostile intent from Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard's (IRGC) show of force has US military intelligence deeply concerned for three fundamental reasons, according to officials:

__label__world Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) Zimbabwe's government warned it would crack down on dissent after three people were killed in clashes between opposition protesters and security forces, overshadowing parliamentary and presidential elections on Wednesday.

The government "will not tolerate any of the actions that were witnessed today," Home Affairs Minister Obert Mpofu said in a late-night press conference.

"The opposition... have perhaps interpreted our understanding to be weak, and I think they are testing our resolve and I think they are making a big mistake."

The violence, which tainted the country's first election since the toppling of veteran leader Robert Mugabe, prompted statements of concern from the United States, United Nations and the United Kingdom.

On Thursday morning, there was uncertainty over whether protesters would take to the streets again, as armed military police patrolled the capital Harare, where Wednesday's violence had broken out.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa's ruling Zanu-PF party won a sweeping majority in parliament, electoral officials said, but the results prompted accusations of poll rigging among the opposition.

The opposition Movement for Democratic Change insisted its leader, Nelson Chamisa, who took over the party's leadership following the death of founder Morgan Tsvangirai in February, won the presidential election.

"THANK YOU ZIMBABWE," he tweeted Wednesday. "I'm humbled by the support you have given to me as a Presidential Candidate. We have won the popular vote. You voted for total Change in this past election! We have won this one together. No amount of results manipulation will alter your WILL #Godisinit."

Supporters of Zimbabwean opposition MDC Alliance Party rip up an electoral poster in support of ZANU-PF party in Harare.

Hundreds of opposition supporters were protesting in the streets on Wednesday when automatic gunfire was heard as police and the army attempted to clear them. Tear gas and a water cannon were also used as crowds fled the scene.

Security forces reportedly beat up protesters. Burning tires could be seen on the roadside while armored vehicles patrolled the capital and a police helicopter flew above.

As this day that ended in tragedy comes to a close, I implore all political and community leaders to utter these words loudly and clearly to all those who follow them - "Seek Peace and Pursue it!" — President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) August 1, 2018

Mnangagwa responded to the unrest by urging his country's political leaders to pursue a peaceful resolution to the uproar.

"As this day that ended in tragedy comes to a close, I implore all political and community leaders to utter these words loudly and clearly to all those who follow them - "Seek Peace and Pursue it!"," he tweeted.

International concern

Earlier he had blamed the MDC for the violence, saying its party leaders had abetted "acts of political violence."

The US Embassy in Harare, the UK and the UN issued statements saying they were concerned about the unrest.

"We urge leaders of all parties to call for calm from members of their respective parties. We further urge the Defense Forces of Zimbabwe to use restraint in dispersing protestors," a US embassy statement said.

A statement from UN Secretary-General António Guterres's office said: "We call on the political leaders and the population as a whole to exercise restraint and reject any form of violence."

UK foreign office minister Harriett Baldwin called for calm, saying that London was closely watching events in the former British colony.

"Call on Zimbabwe's political leaders to take responsibility for ensuring calm & restraint at this critical moment," she tweeted. "We're monitoring the situation closely."

Military tanks patrol the streets of the capital, Harare.

Officials have so far only declared the results of the parliamentary vote, which gave Zanu-PF two-thirds of the seats. International monitors called on the electoral commission to publish the results of the closely fought presidential race.

The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said that Zanu-PF had won 140 seats so far, and the MDC Alliance 58. ZBC state media reported. There are 210 seats in the National Assembly's lower house.

Later the commission tweeted it had announced the results of 207 constituencies, without giving further details about the votes. "The results of the remaining 3 constituencies and presidential results will be announced within 5 days from polling day as stipulated by the law," it added.

On Thursday morning the commission's website was down. Reports said it had been hacked during the night, with pictures of injured protesters posted on it.

Deeply concerned by today's violence in #Harare. Call on Zimbabwe's political leaders to take responsibility for ensuring calm & restraint at this critical moment.

Dr Heike Schmidt, Associate Professor in Modern African History at the University of Reading, said it was likely the official results would be respected.

"Considering that there were major flaws in the 2008 elections that nevertheless led to a government of national unity, it is most likely that that the official results will stand", she said.

"The question now is whether the MDC and its leadership are able to represent their voters in parliament so that Zimbabwe finally has a strong opposition in government again, for the first time since 1987."

Opposition party supporters react after police fire tear gas in Harare.

Severe challenges

Mnangagwa, 75, took power after helping orchestrate a de facto coup against Mugabe in November. He has tried to rebrand Zanu-PF, pledging to heal divisions and rebuild the country.

Known as "the crocodile" for his political cunning and longevity, he is still widely considered to be Mugabe's man because he worked so closely with him for more than 40 years, first as his special assistant during the 1977 liberation war, and later as security minister and justice minister.

Chamisa -- the country's youngest ever presidential candidate -- has aimed to appeal to younger voters with promises of electoral reform, tax cuts and jobs.

While his message may strike a chord, he does not have the same level of backing from the security forces and military, which oversaw Mugabe's departure.

Responding to the unrest Wednesday, Chamisa's spokesman said that protesters were not violent and the deployment of soldiers was unnecessary.

Zimbabwe faces severe challenges as it seeks to recover from an economic crisis dating back to Mugabe's rule.
__label__world Beijing (CNN) One of China's highest-ranking Buddhist monks has denied explosive allegations of sexual misconduct, which accusers claim left at least one victim suicidal.

In a 95-page document submitted to Chinese authorities in July, two male monks at Beijing's Longquan Temple accused Shi Xuecheng of sexually harassing and assaulting multiple female nuns.

It comes at a time when women in China are pushing back hard against widespread sexual abuse, in a manner similar to the #MeToo movement in Western countries.

Xuecheng, who is the abbot of Longquan Temple, is a high-profile figure who heads the Buddhist Association of China and serves as a national political adviser to the Communist government.

The 51-year-old, who has taken a vow of celibacy like most Buddhist monks, posted a brief statement Wednesday night, denying all allegations to his more than a million followers on his verified account on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.

The statement, issued in the name of his temple, alleged the "organized and vicious" whistleblowers had "forged materials, distorted facts and spread false accusations" to mislead the public. It said the temple would ask the government to conduct an official investigation to "put the record straight."

The State Administration for Religious Affairs said in a statement Thursday that the agency "attaches high importance" to the claims against Xuecheng and "has started investigation and verification work."

Buddhist Master Xuecheng arrives at the opening session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing in March 3.

Report censored on social media

The accusers' report contains numerous examples of explicit messages that Xuecheng allegedly sent to at least six nuns. In the messages, Xuecheng is alleged to have demanded total obedience from the nuns, including sexual favors, as part of their study of Buddhist doctrines.

It was leaked online Wednesday and widely circulated on Chinese social media before being censored.

The document has accounts from a number of the alleged victims, some of whom say they were so devastated by their experiences they became mentally unstable or even suicidal.

According to the document, one victim eventually filed a police report in Beijing in June, alleging the abbot had sexually assaulted her and several other nuns.

Shi Xianqi, one of the two monks behind the original document, which also includes allegations of corruption, told CNN on Thursday that he and co-author Shi Xianjia stand by their words and are cooperating with the authorities.

"We have submitted more evidence," he said. "We will now wait for the result of the government probe."

CNN's repeated calls to Longquan Temple and Xuecheng on Thursday went unanswered. Local media reported Thursday that road access to the mountain where the temple is located was abruptly closed after the allegations emerged, with a notice citing "mudslide danger following recent torrential rains."

'Evil in the Buddha's robe'

In a statement to CNN, Xianqi described how he began investigating Xuecheng earlier this year when a "fearful and nervous" nun told him about the explicit messages she had been receiving from the abbot.

After obtaining the messages through legal means, Xianqi said the whistleblowers consulted with police and technical experts, who ruled out the possibility of the abbot's account having been hacked.

"So many faithful Buddhist women wanted to join the temple and I always voted yes," he said in the statement. "Little did I know I was sending them to the tiger's mouth."

"The abbot's learned image has crumbled in my mind," he added. "All that's left is huge fear. He is evil in the Buddha's robe."

China boasts more than 240 million Buddhists despite the ruling Communist Party being officially atheist.

Xuecheng is one of the most high-profile religious leaders in the country, an author of numerous books and a globetrotter in promoting Chinese Buddhism.

The abbot is known to put a modern twist on the ancient religion, maintaining an active online presence and teaching Buddhist ideas through cartoons. In 2016, he attracted brief worldwide attention when his temple launched a humanoid "robot monk" designed to greet young visitors.

His temple is also seen an intellectual bastion with highly educated young monks. Both of the whistleblowers hold doctorate degrees in engineering from one of China's most prestigious universities.

China's #MeToo moment

Xuecheng is not the first prominent Chinese Buddhist monk facing serious allegations in recent years. In 2015, Abbot Shi Yongxin of Shaolin Temple, the country's legendary kung fu monastery, was accused of being an embezzler and womanizer with illegitimate children.

The latest claims against Xuecheng, which surprisingly were published in the English edition of state-run tabloid Global Times, are also part of a number of sexual harassment allegations making waves in China in recent months.

In July, a spreadsheet of accusations against prominent men within non-governmental organizations as well as activist and media circles was widely shared by Chinese women online.

It has drawn comparisons with the #MeToo movement in the West, which has exposed a number of serious allegations against high-profile media and political figures, as women push back against systemic sexual harassment and abuse.

Far from being wary of calling out men whose work is important, many Chinese women airing their accusations have highlighted the hypocrisy of their abusers, and the disparity between their public and private faces.

"They're famous, they're powerful and they make great contributions (to society). That's exactly what makes them think they have the power to sexually harass women," Xiong Jing, director of the Beijing-based Women's Media Monitor Network, told CNN last month.
__label__world (CNN) A sexist remark hurled across Australia's Senate chamber by a male politician at a female lawmaker has now made its way into the courts, after Senator Sarah Hanson-Young filed a defamation suit against David Leyonhjelm, the man who has refused to apologize for insulting her.

"The defamatory statements Senator Leyonhjelm made and continues to make are an attack on my character," Hanson-Young said in a statement after filing the suit on Thursday. "I'm calling this out because it is wrong. No woman, whether she be working behind a bar, in an office or in the Parliament, deserves to be treated this way, and it needs to stop."

It has been more than a month since Leyonhjelm, a libertarian politician told the Green Party's Hanson-Young to "stop shagging men" during a Senate debate on ways to prevent violence against women.

He refused to back down from the comment, conducting several interviews on national television and radio, and pushed back at the female lawmaker. He accused her of "misandry," which he said was the opposite of "misogyny" and was directed at men.

The feud brought into focus a national argument about the traditional masculinity in Australian politics.

Crowdfunding on both sides

Leyonhjelm has long fought against what he has termed political correctness and his political party, the Liberal Democrats, have joined in to help him fight this battle against Hanson-Young.

The party, of which Leyonhjelm is the sole elected representative in either house of Australia's national parliament, has turned the lawsuit into a political contest and urged supporters to contribute to a 'war chest' to take on the environmentally-focused Greens and their "toxic unhinged ideology."

Hanson-Young's crowdfunding campaign has raised a little over $44,000 (60,000 AUD) while Leyonhjelm's has brought in $20,000 (27,000 AUD).

A political strategy

"For those who have called on me to use polite language with my work colleagues and treat them with respect, rest assured that I do," Leyonhjelm wrote in a piece for Australia's Sydney Morning Herald . "But let me be clear: Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is not my work colleague; she is my opponent. We strive for opposing things. If I can inhibit her from achieving her political goals I will."

Senator David Leyonhjelm.

Not everyone is applauding his refusal to back down.

Rather, it appears that some of the media outlets who gave Leyonhjelm an overly generous platform last month are expressing remorse.

"We took him to task on his comments about Senator Hanson-Young, which we felt were inappropriate and an unnecessary reference to Senator Hanson-Young's personal life," Melbourne talk station 3AW said in a statement posted on Hanson-Young's media page

"We think [Leyonhjelm's behavior] is unbecoming and not in keeping with parliamentary standards. We let Senator Leyonhjelm go too far in that interview, and for that we apologize to Senator Hanson-Young."

They echo the country's political leaders, who had already called on him to apologize.

"It was clearly offensive, it should have been withdrawn and apologized for. It's not too late for him to do so now," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told CNN affiliate 9News in early July.

"All of us I suppose get carried away but when you make a mistake, fix it," former Prime Minister Tony Abbott told a Sydney radio station . "People should be better than that."

Fighting for women

Hanson-Young has pledged to donate any funds awarded in the lawsuit to women's empowerment organizations.

"While the Federal Court cannot compel Senator Leyonhjelm to apologize, it does have the power to award damages in my favor which I pledge to donate to two very worthy organizations," she said in Thursday's statement, describing groups that work on gender equality and advocacy services for women.

__label__politics (CNN) Setting up a showdown with California, the Trump administration on Thursday announced a plan to revoke a signature Obama-era environmental regulation.

The administration wants to freeze a rule mandating that automakers work to make cars substantially more fuel efficient. It called its plan a "50-state fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standard for passenger cars and light trucks."

The administration also proposed a withdrawal of California's Clean Air Act preemption waiver. California and about a dozen states that follow its rules account for about a third of all the passenger vehicles sold in the United States.

California Governor Jerry Brown called the proposal "reckless."

"For Trump to now destroy a law first enacted at the request of Ronald Reagan five decades ago is a betrayal and an assault on the health of Americans everywhere," said Brown, in a statement. "California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible."

__label__world Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) Striking new drone images from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, sheds light on the rarely accessible, rebel-held city, under siege for years and bombarded by airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition.

The images were filmed in June by Brazilian photojournalist Gabriel Chaim, who was given limited access by the Houthi rebels who control the city, from where they unseated the Yemeni government in 2015. The footage shows the damage wrought to some of the buildings, but also its enduring beauty and how life goes on amid the rubble and carnage.

The video was shot amid stalling peace talks to slow the siege of the vital port city of Hodeidah. Saudi-led pro-government forces are attacking the vital commercial hub, in a bid to seize it and cut off remaining supplies to Sanaa from the outside world. The United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe that could take 250,000 lives.

The UN warned in May that 22 million Yemenis were dependent on humanitarian assistance or protection -- over eight million of whom are at risk of starvation. Another 10 million could be at risk by the end of the year.In one house, where 13 people were said to have been killed in a 2015 missile strike, 19-year-old Salim Al-Alafe described how 10 of his relatives died.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump said Thursday she does not believe the press is the enemy of the American people, a contrast with her father, President Donald Trump, who has regularly derided the media as such.

Asked at an Axios event at the Newseum in Washington if she believes "the media is the enemy of the people," the White House senior adviser and first daughter replied, "No, I do not."

"No, I don't," she continued. "I've certainly received my fair share of reporting on me personally that I know not to be fully accurate, so I have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and gripe, especially when they're sort of targeted. But no, I do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people."

Ivanka Trump's comments come amid a contentious time between the White House and the press.

Earlier this week, Eric Trump and the President both a shared video of Trump rallygoers in Tampa, Florida, shouting "CNN sucks" at the press while exiting the rally venue.

__label__politics (CNN) Two leading senators are asserting that President Donald Trump has not focused on the clear threat the Kremlin poses in the 2018 elections, with one Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee contending that Russian hackers may have already targeted most -- if not all -- sitting US senators.

Ratcheting up the push for a more robust US response to Russian interference in the midterms and 2020 elections, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are now slated to get a committee vote this month on a bipartisan bill is aimed at shoring up the nation's election system. But the two senators said their plan has run into hurdles for months -- and say the Russian threat is real headed into the midterms.

In a joint interview as the primary season wraps up and with the November midterms less than 100 days away, the senators told CNN Wednesday that there is far more that has to be done -- from the White House on down to the states.

"The intelligence community has been very active on this, the Department of Homeland Security has been active on this," Lankford said. "While the President has been inconsistent in his tweets, and some of the messaging that he's put on it, he's the only one in the government that hasn't been paying attention to this."

Klobuchar added: "There were clearly delays based on things the President was saying that weren't really directing their people to coordinate, they've admitted that under oath. But from the very beginning, Director (Dan) Coats made it clear that Russia has been emboldened and they're getting bolder."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Meghan McCain, daughter of Sen. John McCain and a conservative commentator, speaks with former Vice President Joe Biden "all the time," she told Glamour Magazine in an interview out Thursday.

The two grew closer, she said, following a December appearance together on ABC's "The View," on which McCain is a co-host. The two shared an emotional on-air moment when she asked the former vice president about his son Beau's cancer diagnosis.

McCain's father was diagnosed with glioblastoma , an aggressive brain tumor, in July 2017. Beau Biden passed away from the same cancer in 2015.

"I talk to him all the time, and he checks in on me all the time," Meghan McCain told the magazine.

Joe Biden, a former Democratic senator from Delaware, praised how McCain has handled her father's battle publicly and privately.

"There is no manual to consult when it comes to dealing with a seriously ill parent," he said in an email to the magazine. "But if there was, Meghan McCain would be the one to write it ... Publicly, she has been fierce as John's advocate, and privately, her love and encouragement have sustained him. The way the entire McCain family has handled the cards they have been dealt is worthy of our admiration, and I know John is so incredibly proud of his daughter."

Beau Biden developed a similar bond with the Arizona Republican senator as he fought cancer.

"Look, one of the things that gave Beau courage, my word, was John (McCain). Your dad, you may remember when you were a little kid. Your dad took care of my Beau," Biden told Meghan McCain on air in December.

When he was sick, Biden said, Beau "talked about your dad's courage, not about illness, but about his courage."

McCain also revealed to Glamour that her father's 2008 election opponent, Barack Obama, as well as former first lady Michelle Obama, sent her a handwritten letter following her November wedding.

"It was such a kind gesture, you know? I disagree with him on many things, but kind gestures go far," she said, adding that she privately thanked former top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett when she co-hosted "The View" earlier this year.
__label__politics (CNN) Donald Trump and his political and legal teams are mounting an extraordinary escalation of his attacks against the special counsel's investigation, an apparent sign of increased worry among his allies that Robert Mueller's findings could potentially be deeply damaging to the President.

Trump issued his most explicit and public call on Jeff Sessions to shut down the probe on Wednesday, the latest of a series of threats and pressure on the attorney general and the Justice Department that if carried out would move the drama into Nixonian territory.

"This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further," Trump tweeted. "Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!"

The flurry of activity comes a week after CNN reported that the President's former lawyer Michael Cohen is prepared to tell Mueller that the then-presidential candidate knew in advance about a Trump tower meeting in June 2016 in which Russians planned to offer dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Trump has denied all knowledge of the encounter.

And the tweet also coincides with the start of the trial of Paul Manafort that could boost the credibility of the special counsel operation if it secures a conviction and could also increase the chances that Trump's former campaign chairman decides to cooperate with Mueller.

Trump's words on Sessions set his lawyers and subordinates scrambling and could become a legal liability as the special counsel seeks to establish whether there was a corrupt motive in any effort by the President to obstruct justice.

It also followed a week in which several Trump legal representatives, including Rudy Giuliani, began to publicly question whether collusion -- the question of whether Trump or aides conspired with Russia on election meddling -- is actually a crime.

Those musings set off a torrent of speculation over whether Giuliani understands there is evidence to support such a finding by Mueller and whether he was therefore trying to defuse its potential impact.

Then, on Wednesday, Giuliani again upped the stakes, warning that the coming midterm election would be fought on the question of whether Trump would be impeached.

His comment was clearly part of an effort by Trump's team to motivate the President's supporters to go the polls in the midterm election to stave off a blue wave that could help Democrats seize the House of Representatives.

But it also implied that Mueller could produce evidence in a report that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will feel compelled to send to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings.

A Republican House is seen as far less likely to move against the President, especially after the President's intense efforts to persuade his supporters that the Mueller investigation is corrupt, unfair and biased against him. It could be a much different story under a new Democratic House if the midterms go against the GOP.

Since no one outside Mueller's inner circle knows the extent of the evidence he has collected, and few people not in Trump's orbit have a full picture of his potential exposure, it is impossible to say for sure what is motivating the apparent evolution in the President's defense.

But it does appear that significant statements from the President this week and his legal and political teams at least embrace the possibility that their defense must eventually need to move on from the theoretical possibility of an adverse report by Mueller to a practical response to such an eventuality.

Could a tweet be evidence of obstruction?

Trump's tweet to Sessions immediately provoked conversation about whether he had shown an intent to obstruct justice in plain sight, following a long succession of previous tweets pressuring Sessions that appear to undermine arguments that Trump was acting with no malice in firing former FBI Director James Comey at the time he was in charge of the Russia investigation.

"This is another piece in the puzzle to someone trying to put together a picture of attempted obstruction," said Preet Bharara, the former US attorney for the Southern District of New York on CNN's "The Situation Room."

"Over time, a portrait is developing that the President wants the Russia investigation to be ended."

But Giuliani and the White House argued that the President was merely exercising his right to free speech and offering an "opinion." The former New York mayor pointed out that Trump said Sessions "should" stop the probe not that he "must" stop the probe.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, while lashing the "corruption" and "dishonesty" of the "witch hunt," said, "It's not an order, it's the President's opinion." In defense of the President, other Republicans pointed out that Sessions did not have the capacity to end the investigation anyway, since he has recused himself in favor of Rosenstein.

The pushback from the Trump camp revived the debate over whether Trump's tweets are official statements of policy and intent, or should merely be taken as some kind of ongoing conversation with the American people that has no political or legal significance.

From Mueller's point of view, it may not matter. The New York Times reported last week that Mueller was examining Trump's tweets about Sessions and Comey as he considers whether Trump showed corrupt intent in the firing of the former FBI director and puts pressure on the attorney general in a way that suggests a pattern of obstruction.

"Your motivation, the reason why you do something, your opinion actually has legal significance here," said Susan Hennessey, a CNN legal and national security analyst. "We know that Robert Mueller is looking at these tweets for exactly this purpose."

The tweet could also take on more significance should Trump decide in future to dismiss Sessions in order to appoint an attorney general who is not recused from oversight of the Mueller investigation who would be prepared to shut it down.

But Giuliani this week ridiculed the notion of "obstruction by tweet."

Trump in a dark place

It is not clear exactly what brought on Trump's latest volcanic intervention in the Mueller drama. But he is clearly agitated abou t the meltdown of his relationship with Cohen, amid rising speculation that his one-time confidant could agree to a plea deal if he is charged as a result of a federal probe in New York and could spill secrets to prosecutors about Trump's financial affairs.

Though the White House insists that the Manafort trial in Virginia on tax and fraud charges has nothing to do with the President -- Trump's tweets appear to indicate that he is closely keeping tabs on news coverage of the case

"Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and 'Public Enemy Number One,' or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?" Trump tweeted.

CNN's Kevin Liptak reported Wednesday said that there was not one trigger for the President's Twitter rage on Wednesday but that he's been angry for months about Sessions and was sent into a dark place by the stories about Cohen last week.

But his behavior is perplexing allies who believe that the President would be best served by not behaving in a way that makes it look as though he has something to hide and expects Mueller's investigation to be ultimately damaging towards him.

Republicans who are eying tough midterm elections in November just wish the President would keep his attention on what they believe is a credible story they have to tell on the economy.

"The President can voice his opinion, I don't deny him that ability, in this case I wish he wouldn't I just don't think it helps him," Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.

He added, "I wish he would just let the special counsel finish his work and show the American people what he has found."
__label__politics (CNN) US President Donald Trump tweeted his thanks to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Thursday, after the possible remains of American war dead killed in the Korean War arrived back on US soil.

"Thank you to Chairman Kim Jong Un for keeping your word & starting the process of sending home the remains of our great and beloved missing fallen! I am not at all surprised that you took this kind action. Also, thank you for your nice letter - l look forward to seeing you soon!" Trump tweeted in the early hours of Thursday morning.

On Wednesday 55 cases of what are believed to be the remains of Americans who were killed or captured during the Korean War were transported to a military base in Hawaii, after they were handed over to US officials who had traveled to North Korea last week.

The cases were examined by American experts who concluded they were likely to be American, and likely Korean War combatants.

'A great first step'

There are thousands of Americans who remain unaccounted for after the war, which began when the North invaded the South in 1950. A number of US war dead are believed to be buried in mass graves in North Korea, not far from the border with the South.

Many US families have been waiting on closure for decades, not knowing what became of their loved ones. Since 1990, North Korea has only repatriated the remains of 340.

Vice President Mike Pence took part in the Honorable Carry Ceremony on Wednesday where the remains were delivered in Hawaii. In his remarks he said that more than 8,000 Americans had gone missing or were killed during the war.

Pence mentioned that along with the denuclearization commitment Trump had obtained from Kim during the two leaders' historic summit in Singapore on June 12, Trump had also "secured a promise from Chairman Kim to return the remains of all fallen US service members lost in North Korea."

"We see today as tangible progress to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula," Pence said.

The authenticity of the remains has been hailed as a gesture of good faith on the part of the North Korean leader.

"This is a great first step in terms of bringing a bunch of fallen Americans home," said Rear Admiral Jon Kreitz, the deputy director of the agency in charge of identifying the remains, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA).

"We look forward to potentially pursuing (remains recovery) operations in North Korea in the future and we're very hopeful. Again, this is just a great first step in building some confidence and building a relationship."

Next Trump-Kim Summit?

During their meeting in Singapore in June President Trump floated the possibility of an invitation to the young North Korean autocrat to visit him at the White House.

Since then, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has admitted to lawmakers that North Korea has shown little indication it is moving towards denuclearization.

Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relation Committee in late July, Pompeo acknowledged that North Korean factories "continue to produce fissile material" used in making nuclear weapons.

Pompeo also told the committee that moving toward concrete denuclearization is "a process," adding that it "will definitely take time."

The commander of US Forces Korea, General Vincent Brooks said at the recent Aspen Security Forum that North Korea's "production capability is still intact.

"So we haven't seen a complete shutdown of production yet. We have not seen the removal of fuel rods. These types of things tell us that there are steps that still must be taken on the road to denuclearization," Brooks said.
__label__politics (CNN) Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, is fed up with Democrats' argument that they won't have enough documents to make a decision about Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Standing alongside a handful of other Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Hatch, a typically mild-mannered member of the chamber, called the partisan efforts "dumbass" on Thursday as he begged members to come together in what has become one of the most divisive Supreme Court nominations in recent memory.

"I want to really compliment the Democrats who have stood up and are willing to stand up for Judge Kavanaugh," Hatch said. "We can't keep going down this partisan, picky, stupid, dumbass road that has happened around here for so long. I am sick and tired of it to be honest with you and I'm tired of the partisanship."

Democrats have charged Republicans are withholding vital documents from Kavanaugh's time as a staff secretary in the Bush administration. Republicans, meanwhile, in a display that included stacked boxes in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, have argued the documents they are asking for go far enough in helping Democrats make a determination about Kavanaugh.

"Frankly, we didn't treat their candidates for these positions, the way they are treating ours. I would like to see us hopefully break through and change that," Hatch said.

__label__world CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equal s, a year-long series.

Juba, South Sudan — On a dirt path dotted with bright-red bougainvillea, women in ankle-length dresses gather in groups of five or more before venturing into the forest.

Right outside the largest refugee camp in Juba, South Sudan's capital, sickles readied in their hands to cut firewood, the women say banding together offers a tiny sense of security, a little protection and the reassurance that if something happens to them inside the forest one of them might escape to tell someone.

In four or five hours, they'll be back at the camp, one of them says.

"If God is willing," another adds.

In the five years of South Sudan's civil war, 1.9 million have fled to camps within the country, where the UN provides physical protection as well as food rations amidst an ongoing famine.

South Sudanese women wait for others to join on the way to the forest to get firewood.

To cook the food rations, firewood must be collected -- a task that falls to the women.

"If you're in the forest to collect firewood and the soldiers see you, they will rape you," Nykeer Mut, the women's leader of one of the camp's zones, said.

"But what are we supposed to do?"

The women know of the dangers, she said. They've heard of those who, far from the protection of the camp's razor wire and UN soldiers, were raped, tortured and kidnapped. Or they have experienced it themselves.

Based on interviews, the UN estimates that 70% of women living in camps have been raped. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2013, South Sudanese army soldiers have been accused of using rape and other forms of sexual violence as a tactic of war, aimed at systematically traumatizing and humiliating entire ethnic groups. Outside the refugee camp, when the women get to the forest, soldiers are often already waiting for them, hiding behind tall grass and tree trunks, Mut said.

The day soldiers raped Mut, she recounted that the grass was high and everyone in her group was focused on the task at hand, hoping to return to the camp as quickly as possible. Nobody had seen the soldiers coming, she said.

Nykeer Mut, a women's leader of one of the camp's zones, says she was raped on her way to get firewood.

When the soldiers jumped out of the grass, the women screamed to alert others. They ran for their lives, but the grown soldiers' steps easily outpaced those of Mut's 10-year-old daughter, who had come to the forest to help. The soldiers grabbed the girl. Mut turned around. "I couldn't leave my daughter," she said.

As they tied Mut's hands behind her back, they talked about how young the girl looked, Mut said.

"They said: 'Let's just rape the mother.'"

One soldier pushed Mut to the ground. Two others pinned down the girl, forcing her to watch.

The government has not replied to requests for comment, but a government spokesman told Al Jazeera last September that soldiers who rape are punished. The same spokesman also questioned survivors' claims.

Mut's daughter, who witnessed the rape, photographed in their home at the camp.

Four other residents of the camp said that they too had been attacked in the forest, and several more said that rape and assault are common.

Christine Ayoo, the head of an International Rescue Committee center where rape cases are recorded at the camp, says that such attacks happen every day.

"It's not just rape, we even have kidnappings and killings," she said.

A few months ago, a search party was looking for a small group of women who had disappeared in the forest. They found remains hanging from ropes on a tree -- six in total. The number didn't match the missing group, suggesting that they had found another group. "But we couldn't identify them anymore," Ayoo said.

Women return home to the camp after collecting firewood.

The solution, Mut, Ayoo and others suggest, could be simple: If each family was provided charcoal or firewood, nobody would have to venture outside anymore.

South Sudan's civilians face many dire challenges. An ongoing famine is currently threatening the lives of some 5.7 million people, and humanitarian organizations are scrambling to get emergency relief to the starving. This year alone, 20,000 have fled insecurity and hunger to neighboring Ethiopia. A peace deal is currently being discussed, but such agreements have been made in the past, and the hope for real resolution is low.

So far, the UN has received only about one-fifth of the funding it has appealed for.

"We are in a totally resource-poor environment where we are really just trying to save lives," said Andrea Cullinan, the gender-based violence coordinator for the United Nations Population Fund in South Sudan.

Angeline, a South Sudanese woman, photographed making a fire in her kitchen.

If there was sufficient funding, Cullinan said, NGOs could look into alternatives, such as teaching people how to make briquettes from animal manure or grass. Such initiatives would mitigate risks, however, and not address the root cause of the rape epidemic: Gender inequality.

Civil war, a breakdown of rule of law and impunity for perpetrators has worsened the situation, Cullinan said, "but if it didn't have patriarchal norms that place traditional expectations on women, then you wouldn't have gender-based violence."

A center for girls inside the camp, where -- among other things -- they learn what to do if a man tries to rape one of them while collecting firewood.

With South Sudan's entrenched patriarchy, the chance for girls to obtain an education is harder than anywhere else in the world -- so hard, in fact, that they are more likely to have been married as teenagers than to have gone to primary school.

Their role is that of obedient daughters, sisters and wives, their domains restricted to childcare and cooking. That's also why only women are seen heading into the forest. That men are more likely to be killed than raped plays a role, but even if it were safe, women in South Sudan say societal norms dictate that they fetch firewood.

A woman photographed carrying firewood home from the forest.

And the burden to prevent incidents of sexual violence stays with women and girls who are instructed to protect themselves. They're told: Be careful how you act, mind your environment. And if you can, don't venture out of the camp.

But none of that had protected Mut, or other women like her.

In the afternoon, the women trickle back into the camp from the forest, balancing bundles of firewood as heavy as 60 kilos on their heads. The physical weight doesn't bother them -- they are used to it, they said, and it doesn't compare to the psychological burden of having to go into the forest.

A young girl runs inside the camp, the largest in the capital city.

Mut isn't among them anymore. She hasn't returned to the forest since the attack, and is now living off her meager savings, buying firewood off those who are still taking the risk.

What happens when she runs out of money? She stared at the blank wall of her mud house and sat upright, her turquoise rosary swinging from her neck. She only knows that neither her nor her daughters will ever venture into the forest again.

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria's acting president Yemi Osinbajo has fired the head of the country's intelligence agency, according to Osinbajo's aide, after masked security men prevented lawmakers and staff from entering the country's parliament earlier in the day.

The incident sparked widespread anger in what one Senator described as a "siege" on the country's democracy.

Video of the incident shows Nigeria's lawmakers in angry confrontation with the masked men who blocked all gates leading to the parliament, denying senators and journalists access.

Local media reported that the men were operatives of the State security service headed by Security chief Lawal Musa Daura, who has now been fired.

Several of the lawmakers, mostly from the opposition party, posted images and videos of the blockade, which happened early Tuesday morning.

__label__world (CNN) Australia has long considered itself an immigrant nation. Every year, the number of Australians born overseas increases -- in 2017, it was more than one in four residents, or roughly six million people.

"Australia is the most successful multiculturalism society in the world, it's one of our greatest achievements," Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the national broadcaster in July.

But following an uproar over a neo-Nazi being interviewed on national television and repeated comments by top politicians over "African gangs," questions are emerging over whether Australia is a more racist country than it would like to believe.

"For the most part we are a highly cohesive and harmonious society but that doesn't deny for a moment that racism continues to be a significant social problem," Australia's outgoing Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane told CNN.

On Sunday, nationwide broadcaster, Sky, aired an interview with far-right agitator Blair Cottrell, who has previously been accused in local media of calling for a portrait of Adolf Hitler to be hung "in every (Australian) classroom and every school."

The interview was pulled from social media and the network apologized after a large backlash, but the fact it was aired in the first place has raised questions about Australia's attitude to race.

In a speech to the Whitlam Institute in Sydney on Monday, after the interview aired, Soutphommasane said Australia's "racial harmony" was under threat.

"I take no pleasure in saying this, but, right now, it feels like there has never been a more exciting time to be a dog-whistling politician or race-baiting commentator in Australia," the outgoing commissioner told the audience.

Thanks to @Whitlam_Inst for hosting last night's speech & to all who came. Special thanks to @markdreyfusQCMP & Prof John Hewson for joining me in a discussion about the return of race politics.

Australians: Immigration levels 'too high'

Australia's population is expected to hit a record high of 25 million within days, according to the country's Bureau of Statistics, partially due to an influx of migrants, among them more than 500,000 Australian residents who were born in China.

But this diversity has often come hand-in-hand with discrimination against immigrants, from the infamous White Australia policy in the mid-20th century that effectively banned non-European migrants from settling in Australia, to the One Nation political party formed in 1997 to oppose Asian migration.

Polling by Australian research company Essential shows opinions on immigration are divided -- more than half of Australians considered multiculturalism to have "enriched the social and economic lives of all Australians," in a survey published in April 2018.

But in the same poll, 64% of those surveyed said they thought immigration levels to Australia over the past 10 years were "too high."

"Australia does multiculturalism far better than a lot of comparative countries. But I think Australia's problem, and our potential danger, is our complacency," Asian-Australian writer Benjamin Law told CNN.

Law said the majority of non-anglo Australians had experienced racism in their lifetimes, something the rest of the population might not appreciate.

"I think we are so enamored with the idea of ourselves as successfully multicultural and not racist that when actual racism is presented to us in our media, in our government, we don't recognize it," he said.

Since his term in office began in 2013, Soutphommasane has staunchly opposed a push by conservative politicians, media and commentators to change Australia's Racial Discrimination Act.

Efforts to reform the act have been a signature policy of Australia's conservatives in recent years. The Turnbull government attempted in 2017 to pass a bill which would have made it no longer illegal to "offend, insult or humiliate" people based on their race.

"People do have a right to be bigots, you know," then-Attorney General George Brandis said during a parliamentary debate on the issue in 2014.

African gangs

Not all the recent rhetoric has been focused at a legislative level, however.

In the past eight months, with a state election looming, conservative politicians and media figures have repeatedly claimed gangs of African youths are terrorizing the city of Melbourne.

Statistics from the Crime Statistics Agency do reveal Sudanese residents are over-represented in crime numbers in the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital.

Lending credence to this, Prime Minister Turnbull said there was a "real concern about Sudanese gangs," during an interview on Melbourne radio station, 3AW, in July.

However, crimes involving Sudanese residents account for just 1% of Victoria's total criminal activity , with the vast majority of crimes committed by Australian-born residents.

"If you were to focus on race and ethnicity only when talking about crime you end up with a distorted and dangerous debate," Soutphommasane told CNN.

Amid the debate around African gangs, Home Affairs Minister Dutton has been leading a campaign to look at potentially allowing special visas for white South African farmers to move to Australia.

In an interview on March 14, the Australian minister said he was concerned by reports of an alleged widespread campaign of violence against the white farmers.

"I've asked my department to look at options and ways in which we can provide some assistance ... I do think on the information I've seen people do need help and they need help from a civilized country," Dutton told Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph.

'Boundless plains to share'

The less popular second verse of the Australian national anthem contains the lines, "For those who've come across the seas, we've boundless plains to share."

While Soutphommasane said Australia still has an enormous, cohesive multicultural society, he is concerned there was a "very real prospect" of racism becoming normalized in Australian public debate.

"I do take confidence from the enormous support that exists in Australian society for multiculturalism. The majority of Australians believe (it) makes Australia better country," he said.

Law said racism in Australia appears to come in waves, and growing up as a young Asian-Australian in the 1980s it was something he rarely encountered.

But he said he was concerned about what effect the latest round of rhetoric was having on young Australians, from migrant families, growing up in Australia today.

"I am kind of worried about how laissez-faire we've become with tolerating hate speech in this country," he said.
__label__world (CNN) Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila will not seek election for a third term, his spokesman announced Wednesday.

Kabila instead nominated his interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary as his successor.

The announcement reported in local media brought an end to speculation that Kabila would bypass the country's two-term limit to stand in the December 23 elections.

Kabila succeeded his father, Laurent, after his assassination in 2001 and has since maintained a strong grip over the central African nation.

His second term ended in 2016 but he refused to step down from power l eading to widespread protests where 17 people died

Kabila tried to change the constitution to extend his term in office-- despite an agreement reached by his representatives and opposition leaders.

Congo's former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba returned to the country last week and has announced plans to contest in December elections.

Responding to the news of Kabila stepping down, rights group Amnesty said it was "welcome news" for the Congolese.

However, Jean-Mobert Senga Amnesty researcher for DRC, said Kabila must do more to show that his government will "show a real commitment to ensuring an environment where people can freely exercise their human rights throughout the election cycle."

Senga urged Kabila to formally lift the ban on peaceful demonstrations and release all those detained "solely for exercising their human rights."
__label__politics Over the past two weeks, the aggressive new voice of the progressive left has crisscrossed the Midwest, making a stop in Kansas to campaign alongside Bernie Sanders as well as solo trips to Missouri and Michigan to stump for insurgent candidates hoping to follow in her path.

That Ocasio-Cortez consistently finds herself hundreds of miles from the Bronx and Queens, where in June she stunned the political world by unseating the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, shows just how important the next several weeks are for the movement she has come to represent.

Beginning with contests in those three states on August 7, and continuing on for nearly five consecutive weeks after that, progressive outsiders will test their mettle against establishment Democrats in elections from Hawaii to Delaware and Massachusetts.

Success in any of these races has the potential to not only shape the 2018 field but embolden a future crop of progressives -- and signal a shift further to the left within the Democratic Party. On the flip-side, a shutout would stifle -- or at least put on hold -- any suggestion that the party's moderates are facing an existential threat from their left flank.

Campaigning for Michigan's Abdul El-Sayed, who is vying against the odds and conventional wisdom to become the country's first Muslim governor, Ocasio-Cortez explained the core electoral assumption underlying the movement.

"Our swing voter is not red-to-blue," she said at a stop in Flint. "Our swing voter is the voter to the non-voter, the non-voter to the voter."

In an interview later, she all but dismissed the existence of a persuadable center.

"I don't think that swing voters decide based on how much a candidate has run to the middle the most," Ocasio-Cortez said. "I know people who are swing voters, and when I think about how they decide, they don't say, 'Oh I'm voting for this person because they became the most Republican out of the whole race to earn my vote' ... Expanding the electorate is the path."

It's an argument that progressive candidates and operatives have been trying to make to skeptical Democratic Party leaders for the past few years.

Ocasio-Cortez, her team and allies are clear-eyed about the math and the narrative perils. Most of the candidates now riding her wave of national attention are considered long shots. But so was she.

Even then, losses do not always equal defeat, she argued, pointing to James Thompson in Kansas' 4th Congressional District to make her case. In 2016, Republican Mike Pompeo won the seat by 30 points. Thompson fell short, as expected, in 2017's special election but the result was a shock to the system -- he had come within 6 points of winning.

"He, as a progressive, alone turned that seat from an impossible race to a flippable district," Ocasio-Cortez said. "He lost that race last year, but does that mean that his work was pointless? Absolutely not, because now we're queued up in 2018 to potentially take the seat ... I'm hoping that even if a candidate doesn't win in this cycle, they will have created gains for 2020, for 2022."

Against the odds

As recently as June, before Ocasio-Cortez struck her signature blow, the insurgency seemed destined to claim its successes further down the ballot, and mostly out of the national political conversation. But that changed when 10-term incumbent House Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley, offered his public concession.

Ocasio-Cortez immediately began telegraphing her next steps and indicated that growing her own lonely ranks was a priority.

"My hope is that I'm not the only one. My hope is that I won't be the sole standard-bearer and that's a big part of doing this whole tour," she said of her primary season itinerary. "I mean, I don't know if I'd call it a tour, but that's the whole point of supporting other progressive candidates because I shouldn't be the spokesperson. No one person should be the spokesperson for an entire movement because a movement by definition is a collective. And so I am just one perspective."

Hours after her own win, Ocasio-Cortez quoted Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley and called on supporters to "vote her in next." House candidate Cori Bush in Missouri and Florida's Chardo Richardson -- both of them, along with Pressley, challenging sitting Democratic House members -- also got a shout.

There were more, headlined by the 33-year-old doctor from Michigan: El-Sayed.

On July 2, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the state was "blessed to have @AbdulElSayed as a candidate for Governor, and I am proud to support him."

She could hardly be accused of glory-hunting. El-Sayed had consistently polled in third place behind the frontrunner, former state Senate minority leader Gretchen Whitmer. He also trailed the self-funding millionaire Shri Thanedar, a political wild card who was the first of the three to hit the airwaves.

"They said I wouldn't be welcome here," Ocasio-Cortez said upon arriving in Grand Rapids on Saturday, a wink at the pundits -- some of them elected, like Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth -- who have suggested the region might be off-limits to her leftist politics.

An upset for a candidate like El-Sayed, with his detailed plan for statewide single-payer health care and open disdain for corporate campaign cash, won't end the conversation, but it would brush back the movement's critics while boosting its leaders.

In the meantime, El-Sayed insists to reporters and supporters that the bad poll numbers are simply the product of bad polling. The momentum, he says, is his. History, too. Sanders won here despite trailing heavily in the run-up to the 2016 presidential primary.

The Vermont senator, who endorsed El-Sayed last week, will rally with him on Sunday. But the buzz surrounding his events with Ocasio-Cortez required no spin. The Sanders coalition, especially with the New Yorker in town, seemed to be showing itself off again.

For the true-believers on the left, El-Sayed's case is a special one -- a necessary fight for a movement committed to distinguishing itself from the party's moderates, even if it ends with fat lips all around.

"(Sanders) inspired people to believe in his message because they knew he wasn't bought by corporations, because he wanted to actually solve the problems that they face," El-Sayed said in an interview somewhere between Grand Rapids and Flint. "He wasn't proposing halfway measures, and he was able to inspire them, and we're doing exactly the same thing."

He struck the note again hours later, telling supporters, "Every day I get somebody who comes up to me and says, 'I've never registered to vote, not even once, and I literally registered to vote for you: so don't let me down.' That says something about this electorate."

The frontrunner -- and an afternoon in church

While El-Sayed has struggled to squelch Thanedar, who despite a lack of bona fides has tried to claim the progressive mantle, Whitmer seems on pace to win the nomination -- and knock the progressive surge back on its heels.

Unlike her opponents, the former state legislator would not pursue a short-term move to single-payer health care. News that officers from the PAC run by the state's largest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, promoted to employees a Whitmer fundraiser earlier this year led El-Sayed, who has forsworn corporate PAC money, to quip at a debate that he's "not bought off by the folks like Blue Cross Blue Shield."

"First of all, it's a phony attack," Whitmer said early Saturday evening, during a quick break from knocking doors in Detroit's Indian Village neighborhood. "And secondly, it's extremely sexist to say that a woman is beholden to her father's former employer ... 84% of the record-breaking money that we raised in this campaign is from Michigan. Eighty-two percent of it is $100 or less."

Her father, Richard Whitmer, was the president and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan from 1988 to 2006. Though his name never came up during the weekend, the connection colors every mention of the insurer.

Susan Demas, a Democratic strategist and the former editor and publisher of Inside Michigan Politics, attributes Whitmer's lead in the polls to the good faith she established with liberals during her time in the legislature, when she helped deliver the votes on a deal to increase Medicaid to 680,000 people and took a lead role in opposing the state GOP's "right-to-work" law. Years before the #MeToo movement took shape, Whitmer made headlines when she spoke out publicly about being sexually assaulted in college.

"One downside to Abdul really hitting the Blue Cross argument is that he keeps tying it back to (Whitmer's) father and that really offends a lot of progressive women," Demas said. "There's always a risk when you go strong with an argument and I think, although it's probably won him some of those progressive Bernie Sanders voters, it's not helped him pick up votes with traditional Democratic women."

In Ypsilanti on Sunday, inside the packed and sweltering Brown Chapel AME Church, that less traditional Democratic woman, Ocasio-Cortez, was greeted -- again -- with rapturous applause.

A call to volunteer, before El-Sayed and she spoke, had a revival feel to it -- stand up, be counted, pledge some time and be celebrated.

"The only way is to move forward," she said, after being introduced by El-Sayed. "We have to decide if we're going to change for the worse or change for the better. Because the status quo is not an option anymore."
__label__world (CNN) Taiwan's government has mocked Beijing over rumors a new film featuring Winnie the Pooh has been banned in mainland China, due to comparisons between the yellow bear and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

On its official Twitter account, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry posted an image of their tourism mascot Oh! Bear, saying he was dismayed "his cousin Winnie's" film had been "banned" by Chinese authorities.

"Make no mistake: All bears are created equal in Taiwan and "Christopher Robin" is screening nationwide," the ministry said.

The new Disney film centers around a grown-up Christopher Robin reuniting with his old friends from the Hundred Acre Wood, including Winnie the Pooh and Piglet.

But Chinese filmgoers may not get a chance to see the movie, after reports emerged it won't be approved by the ruling Chinese Communist Party 's propaganda officials to be shown in theaters.

Taiwan's #OhBear is dismayed at the ban slapped on his cousin Winnie's latest film by censors in #China.

There has been no official announcement regarding "Christopher Robin," but many media outlets suggested there could be a link between the decision not to show the film and the Chinese government's crackdown on images of Winnie the Pooh.

Cheeky netizens in China have often linked Pooh to Xi, claiming there is an uncanny resemblance between the two and provoking the wrath of Chinese censors.

But given only 34 foreign films are allowed into the country every year, blockbusters tend to dominate the list in an attempt to turn the greatest profit.

In addition, there's no blanket ban in mainland China on the character of Winnie the Pooh -- his books and toys can still be bought widely across the country.

By drawing attention to rumors of a ban by Beijing on the film, Taiwan's government is attempting to highlight its greater freedom of expression compared to the mainland, at a time when the two governments are locked in a furious battle over the island's status.

Despite Taiwan being self-governed for almost 70 years, the Beijing government continues to view the island as an integral part of its territory.

China's State Film Bureau, which approves all foreign movies shown in the country, did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.
__label__world (CNN) The death of a 23-year-old student, who killed herself two months after she alleged she was raped has renewed anger over sexual violence against women in South Africa.

Khensani Maseko, a student at the Rhodes University in Grahamstown, said she was raped by another student in May, according to a statement by the university.

On August 3, the day she took her own life, Maseko posted a cryptic message on social media.

"No one deserves to be raped," she wrote and posted on Instagram with a picture showing what is believed to be her date of birth and that day's date.

Maseko's account has since been removed from Instagram.

Rhodes University confirmed her death and said authorities held a meeting with Maseko's parents after she reported in July that she had been raped.

The university says it was agreed that Maseko should be taken home pending an investigation into her allegations.

The third-year student died a few days before her scheduled return to the university, where she was to meet with those investigating the case at the institution.

The man accused of the rape has been suspended, the university said in the statement posted on its website , adding that it was working with South Africa's police and the National Prosecuting Authority to launch an inquest into Maseko's death.

Police have not released the suspect's name.

"The tragic passing of Khensani will not mark an end to the investigation into the circumstances leading up to her passing," Rhodes University Vice-Chancellor Dr. Sizwe Mabizela said.

The university's flag will be flown at half-staff to honor Maseko, Mabizela added.

There was a mass outpouring of grief from friends, family and the university community as the student was laid to rest in Johannesburg Thursday.

Maseko's mother in an emotional tribute to her daughter, said her death has left a "gaping and bleeding hole" in her heart, local media reported.

"Khensi‚ your tragic passing left a gaping and bleeding hole in my heart. You were my pride and joy from the moment I held you for the first time. I loved you with every fibre in me‚" Thembi Thobile Maseko said at the funeral.

"You were my child and yet my little sister I never had. We had a wonderful life together. We shared the highs and the lows."

Women killed at higher rate

Statistics show sexual violence against women is a serious problem in South Africa.

According to estimates released in June by the national statistical service of South Africa, 138 out of every 100,000 women in the country were raped in 2016 and 2017.

"This figure is among the highest in the world. For this reason, some have labeled South Africa the 'rape capital of the world,'" it said.

By comparison, the 2015 figures for the number of rapes in Switzerland was 6.4 cases per 100,000 women.

Also, the country's rate of femicide — the killing of a woman or a girl because she is female -- is five times more than the global rate

TotalShutDown march

Maseko's death has sparked public outrage in South Africa, where women often use social media to share images of women who have been killed by their partners.

South African women protest against gender abuse in Cape Town, South Africa on August 1, 2018.

The TotalShutDown protest was held to unite South African women against the ongoing "war on their bodies," said Loyiso Saliso, a spokeswoman for the movement.

"August is the woman's [month] but women in this country are not happy. We have nothing to feel, we have nothing to celebrate. The issue of gender-based violence has only been getting worse rather than better and that is very visible in our statistics as well," she said.

The women marched to South Africa's Parliament, Supreme Court of Appeal and other provincial and regional structures to hand over a memorandum of demands to the government.

"When perpetrators are more afraid of the consequences they are going to face once they violate women, we will start seeing less of women and children disappearing, or being killed," Saliso said.

A priority crime

In May, Sandile Mantsoe was found guilty of the Johannesburg murder of 22-year-old Karabo Mokoena, his ex-girlfriend.

The day he was convicted, a student at Mangosuthu University of Technology in Umlazi, Zolile Khumalo, was allegedly shot and killed by her boyfriend.

In many cases of violence against women, partners are involved in the crime, but South African women are also victims of random rapes and killings.

South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma declared violence against women "a priority crime" after a string of killings that shocked the country in 2016.

He called on law enforcement agencies in the country to ensure all perpetrators of sexual violence were brought to justice.

Renewed fears

But Maseko's death has reignited fears over sexual violence in the country.

Star Khulu, 28, told CNN she tries to make herself look less attractive anytime she leaves her home in Johannesburg.

She said she believes dressing in a less provocative manner reduces her risk of being sexually assaulted.

As a strategist in an advertising agency, she avoids coming home late from work. Even in the daytime, she takes precautions.

"I detour if I am approaching more than two men at a time. Sometimes you just don't want to hear the catcalling, even if you say hello and move on -- that could be an invitation for more," she said.

Khulu says men have become aggressive in the past when she did not acknowledge their advances.

"A man once grabbed my arm in a supermarket because I didn't look at him and smile when he said I was beautiful. Men grab your bum and don't see anything wrong with it," Khulu said.

"Sometimes, I just smile at them to avoid trouble. I try everything, every day not to get raped," she said.

__label__world (CNN) New Zealand is joining a growing list of countries attempting to get rid of single-use plastic shopping bags.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the decision on Friday, and said the ban was necessary to "safeguard New Zealand's clean, green reputation."

Retailers nationwide seemed to agree, and were quick to voice their support after the announcement, a stark contrast to the recent furor in neighboring Australia over a similar plastic bag ban.

There, plans by major retailers to phase out single-use plastic bags caused outrage, and even violence towards a checkout worker whose neck was grabbed by an angry customer, local media reported.

Facing public and media pressure, major Australian supermarket chain Coles announced last week it would give plastic bags away indefinitely for free. After this sparked more outrage from those concerned about the environment, Coles backtracked the following day, announcing customers would again have to pay a fee for plastic bags.

There haven't been many signs of resistance so far in New Zealand, said associate environment minister Eugenie Sage.

Still, they're not taking any risks. The process will begin with a consultation period, during which people can submit concerns and suggestions online.

"We're listening to New Zealanders who want us to take action on this problem," Ardern said in her statement. "We need to be far smarter in the way we manage waste and this is a good start."

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks during a press conference at Parliament on August 7, 2018 in Wellington, New Zealand.

New Zealand is lagging significantly behind some European nations , which began phasing out plastic bags more than 15 years ago. Dozens of other countries and cities have already imposed bans or restrictions on plastic goods, including microbeads, plastic straws, and coffee pods.

New Zealand officials are confident their citizens are ready for the change.

In her statement, Ardern pointed to a Greenpeace petition calling for an outright plastic bag ban, which was signed by 65,000 New Zealanders and presented to parliament this February.

"It's also the biggest single subject school children write to me about," she added. "Just like climate change, we're taking meaningful steps to reduce plastics pollution so we don't pass this problem to future generations."

Sage said the plastic bag ban is "something New Zealanders really want."

"We have seen communities and councils calling for action," Sage told CNN. "Kiwis care, and I think New Zealanders want to keep our beaches, keep our oceans clean of plastic pollution."

One possible reason Australians resisted the ban was that the government didn't take enough action to implement it across the entire retail sector, as New Zealand aims to do, Sage added.

A study released earlier this year found a 30% drop in plastic bags on the seabed in northern Europe , which scientists tied to the widespread introduction of plastic ban charges and restrictions.

Some retailers are already one step ahead. In early June, 12 local and international companies signed a joint declaration committing to using 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging in their New Zealand operations by 2025. Notable signatories include L'Oréal, the Coca-Cola Company, and Nestlé.

"We are absolutely thrilled the Government has begun consultation on a mandatory phase out on single-use plastic carrier bags in New Zealand," Kiri Hannifin, the general manager of major supermarket chain Countdown, said in a statement Friday

The Warehouse Group, one of the largest retail groups in New Zealand, also released a statement applauding an "historic occasion for New Zealand's environment."

New Zealand has long prided itself on its environmentalism. In April , Ardern introduced a new cap on offshore drilling for oil and gas in an effort to combat climate change and move toward a "carbon neutral economy." A Zero Carbon Bill, which would introduce a 2050 target to reduce carbon emissions, is also being drafted.

The new plastic bag phase-out is beginning with the public consultation period, which ends on September 14. The government will then finalize details such as which bags to include and which retailers might be exempted, and plans to implement the policy in roughly six months' time
__label__world (CNN) Amateur fossil enthusiast Phil Mullaly knew he had found something special when he spotted something glimmering in a boulder.

Mullaly was walking along Jan Juc, a renowned fossil site along Victoria's Surf Coast in south Australia, when he spotted a partially exposed shark tooth in the rock.

"I was immediately excited, it was just perfect," Mullaly said.

That was just one of multiple teeth Mullaly found that day in 2015. Three years later, scientists have confirmed his hunch, saying Thursday that the teeth are all about 25 million years old and belonged to an extinct species of mega-toothed shark -- the Great Jagged Narrow-Toothed Shark (Carcharocles angustidens).

The ancient shark was believed to grow up to about 9 meters (30 feet) long, double the size of a great white shark. The teeth discovered on the beach were around 7 cm (2.75 inches) in length.

Mullaly's is one of the rarest finds in the history of paleontology, according to Erich Fitzgerald, a palaeontologist at Museums Victoria who led a team to excavate the site where the initial fossils were found.

"If you think about how long we've been looking for fossils around the world as a civilization -- which is maybe 200 years -- in (that time) we have found just three (sets of) fossils of this kind on the entire planet, and this most recent find from Australia is one of those three," Fitzgerald told CNN.

'My jaw sort of dropped'

Fitzgerald said he was first contacted by Mullaly last year about a different discovery, during which he briefly mentioned the find at Jan Juc, but it wasn't until the amateur fossil hunter brought the teeth into the museum that Fitzgerald realized how significant the discovery was.

Sharks have the ability to regrow teeth, and can lose up to a tooth a day. That cartilage does not easily decompose, which is why individual shark tooth fossils are somewhat common. However, Fitzgerald said that finding multiple teeth from a single shark is extremely rare.

"That doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen. That's only happened once before in Australia, and that was a totally different species of shark," he said.

When Mullaly told him the boulder he found was still on the beach, Fitzgerald said "my jaw sort of dropped."

Fitzgerald organized a team to get down to the south Australia coast. They chose to conduct the excavation in December 2017, when the tides were low. Within 20 minutes of searching, Fitzgerald's team started to find teeth.

In the end, they extracted more than 40 different specimens. Fitzgerald attributes the finds to dogged work and a bit of luck.

"Paleontology is one of the last branches of science where serendipity, where chance events, timing, coincidence plays a most vital role," he said.

"On that particular day at that particular time, Phil Mullaly was the right man for the job on that beach on the southern coast of Australia."

Sharks eating sharks

The teeth Fitzgerald's team found didn't just belong to the Great Jagged Narrow-Toothed Shark. They also found teeth belonging to several different Sixgill sharks (Hexanchus), Museums Victoria said , a species that still roams Australia's coastal waters.

Researchers believe those teeth were left behind as a result of getting lodged in the carcass of the Great Jagged Narrow-Toothed Shark as smaller sharks fed on it after the much larger animal died.

"The teeth of the sixgill shark work like a crosscut saw, and tore into the Carcharocles angustidens like loggers felling a tree. The stench of blood and decaying flesh would have drawn scavengers from far around," Museums Victoria palaeontologist Tim Ziegler said in a statement.

"Sixgill sharks still live off the Victorian coast today, where they live off the remains of whales and other animals. This find suggests they have performed that lifestyle here for tens of millions of years."

What's next?

Fitzgerald's team has finished their field research and are now working to learn more about how the teeth of the Great Jagged Narrow-Toothed shark developed in order to better understand its evolutionary history.

"If we can find out any more clues about the lifestyle (and) the ecology of this extinct species, that might shed light as to what led to its extinction," he said.

Fitzgerald said he believes there may be even more shark teeth at Jan Juc and even parts of a spinal column lodged in the cliff, based on what he saw during the excavation. For now, those potential samples are about 20 meters (65 feet) high, out of the reach of excavators.

"I'm willing to bet there's more up there," he said. "We'll be waiting and ready for the next expedition down to salvage a giant prehistoric shark."
__label__world August 10 is International Prisoner Justice Day. We take a look in this feature and accompanying video at some of the ways the Kenyan prison service is helping to transform prisoners' lives.

(CNN) When Peter Ouko was sentenced to death for murder 20 years ago, he was sent to Kenya's Kamiti maximum security prison, notorious for being one of the worst jails in the world.

The prison was modeled on an old-style colonial system, torture was widespread, and inmates were forced to sleep on the floor amid squalor and unsanitary, overcrowded conditions.

Ouko was sometimes locked up in a small cell with 13 other men for 23 and a half hours a day. Food was not guaranteed, and beatings were frequent.

"When I went to prison in 1998 it was pure torture, and for the first five years, I saw bad things happening," he said.

Ouko faced an endless wait for his executioner as he resigned himself to his fate, far away from his two young children and his old life as a successful interior designer.

Ouko, speaking at TEDxKamitiPrison, discussing his inspirations and his anti-crime initiaitive.

He also thought often of his wife. His dead wife, whom he was accused of murdering after her body was found near a police station in 1998. Ouko rushed to the site, only to find himself immediately arrested for her murder at the scene. He believes he was framed.

"It was devastating, but I felt that someone wanted to get to me. It wasn't about getting justice because I believe that if it was about justice, we could have worked together to get that justice."

He would spend two years awaiting trial and his children were taken away from him. Ouko later found out they were told he was dead.

Becoming a lawyer

But the arrival of one man to the Kenyan political scene in 2003 would drastically change the fortunes of Kamiti prison-- and Ouko's.

"We had a new vice president who brought the humane touch to the prisons department," Ouko says.

That vice president was Moody Awori or as he was popularly known, Uncle Moody.

"It was a big deal when Uncle Moody came and decided to change everything. The first thing, he outlawed torture. He replaced the baton with the pen, " recalls Ouko.

Most importantly, Moody started to treat the inmates like human beings, providing mattresses and bedding for the prison service for the first time, as well as access to healthcare.

"We used to be carried in cramped up prison trucks where we could be packed like sardines. It used to be called Maria. But when Uncle Moody came, he brought buses where inmates could sit and be taken to court, and we started calling them Moody Hoppers," he says.

But the most significant change at Kamiti -- and the one that changed Ouko's life -- was the focus on prisoner education.

In 2014, Ouko became the first Kenyan inmate to earn a law diploma behind bars.

However, studying behind bars was not easy. It meant having to balance numerous court trips, writing appeals pro-bono for his colleagues and advising them on how to make their presentations in court.

Being the most qualified "lawyer" among 2,000 inmates was daunting, but people outside the prison walls were demanding his service too.

He recalls that a Kenyan who watched his graduation on TV visited Kamiti prison and requested his help to draft a petition to sue his employers who had allowed their dogs to bite him.

The man later came back to say he had been awarded $10,000, signaling to Ouko that his education was not only useful in helping inmates, but poor Kenyans too.

The African Prisons Project

Ouko's education was made possible by Awori's reforms and the efforts of the African Prisons Project.

African Prisons Project (APP), a charity founded in 2007 by UK barrister Alexander McLean, works to provide education and healthcare in prisons on the continent.

McLean was inspired to set up the charity after helping to treat prisoners in Uganda while volunteering at a hospital in his teens and saw how little value was placed on some people's lives, especially the poorer patients.

"I realized that there are people whose lives aren't valued by their societies, who live and die like dogs," McLean says.

The APP trains prisoners and prison staff as lawyers. So far, 3,000 people have been released from the Ugandan and Kenyan prisons after getting legal services from those the APP has trained, according to its figures.

By 2020, they have ambitions to release 30,000 people from prison through their trainees.

"Our students have been involved in several Supreme Court cases, including one which resulted in the abolition of the mandatory death sentence in Uganda," he added.

The APP will also create a first-of-its-kind law college in a Kenyan prison, which will open in 2020.

Breaking down barriers

Prisoners advocating for other prisoners in open court, or advising non-prisoners on the law, is uncharted territory in Kenya and most places in the world.

These are the kind of reforms that have got people talking about the Kenyan prison system.

Kamiti now has a well-stocked library, industrial workshops, and the option for other students to study for law degrees.

They have organized a TEDx conference at Kamiti prison, and prisoners are learning mindfulness techniques.

Significantly, the barrier between prisoners and prison staff have been broken down.

"We try to bring everybody on board, the prison officers, the prisoners -- we are a team," said Vincent Gumbi, a warden at Kamiti prison. " We cannot achieve when we get walls between the prisoners and the prison officers."

McLean says he has seen a transformation in the attitude of prison staff. "We work together as a family of prisoners and prison staff, " he says.

"We have law classes where prisoners would be teaching the prison staff law. Some of the staff we work with say 'before I started working with you, I took joy in beating up prisoners. Now my joy is winning them their freedom using the legal knowledge that I've acquired.'"

The UNODC Global Maritime Crime Programme, which offers training and support in Kenya's maximum security prisons, lauded the "excellent relationship between officers and prisoners" in Kenya.

A spokesman for UNODC said it's "significantly important for both security and management of prisons as well as supporting rehabilitation of individuals. Also, prisoners have access to family and friends as well as access to rehabilitation services including vocational training and education."

'Crime is not cool'

In 2016, Kenya commuted the death sentences of all prisoners to life sentences and gave prisoners the right to vote for the first time in the 2017 elections.

Ouko was also officially pardoned by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and released from prison after 18 years behind bars in October 2016. His death sentence had been commuted to life in 2009.

Since his release, he has given a TED talk about his experiences and now devotes his time to defending the rights of African prisoners through his prison charity Crime Si Poa, which is Swahili for "crime is not cool."

"The inmates who had been released, we use them to engage the community. Go to schools and speak to them... go out to the communities, we help them build cohesion. We help them build peace in conflict areas," Ouko says.

US prisons are already looking to other countries such as Norway for ideas on prison reform, but Ouko thinks they shouldn't be afraid to look further afield.

"It's a global village. It doesn't have to come from the west to Africa. I'd like to invite the administrators of the prisons in America and the Western prisons to come to visit Kenyan prisons because there are best practices to learn," Ouko says.

"You walk into a maximum Kenyan prison, and you see people busy doing stuff. It builds hope. It brings down the level of recidivism. It brings down the level of tension in prisons. You shouldn't lock someone for 23 hours a day. I was locked up. It didn't help me. It made me resentful and angry," he adds.

It is a view echoed by McLean, who says there are models of prisoner rehabilitation being developed in Kenya's prisons that should be emulated worldwide.

He says "in Kenya, there's a sense that anything is possible in prison."

In contrast, McLean says, the UK had a high number of prisoner suicides in 2016.

"Billions and billions of dollars are being spent imprisoning people. Our recidivism rates are high and often prisons are characterized by hopelessness," McLean says.

"There are unbelievable lessons countries like the United States could learn about making prisons humane places where lives are transformed, thereby making society safer because people leave prison different from how they went in.

"I look forward to seeing exciting best practices being taken from Africa to the West."
__label__politics Above the South China Sea (CNN) High above one of the most hotly contested regions in the world, CNN was given a rare look Friday at the Chinese government's rapidly expanding militarization of the South China Sea.

Aboard a US Navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance plane, CNN got a view from 16,500 feet of low-lying coral reefs turned into garrisons with five-story buildings, large radar installations, power plants and runways sturdy enough to carry large military aircraft.

During the flight the crew received six separate warnings from the Chinese military, telling them they were inside Chinese territory and urging them to leave.

"Leave immediately and keep out to avoid any misunderstanding," a voice said.

The US Navy jet flew past four key artificial islands in the Spratly chain where China has built up fortifications: Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Johnson Reef and Mischief Reef.

On Subi Reef, the Poseidon's sensors picked up 86 vessels, including Chinese coast guard ships, moored in a giant lagoon, while on Fiery Cross Reef rows of hangers stood alongside a lengthy runway.

"It was surprising to see airports in the middle of the ocean," said Lt. Lauren Callen, who was leading the air combat crew aboard the Navy flight.

Each time the aircraft was challenged by Chinese military, the US Navy crew's response was the same.

"I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state," the response said.

"In exercising these rights guaranteed by international law, I am operating with due regard for the rights and duties of all states."

CNN has reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.

CNN gets rare access on board a US military surveillance flight over the hotly-disputed islands in the South China Sea.

Competing claims

The Chinese government staunchly maintains large areas of the South China Sea have been part of the country's territory "since ancient times."

Beijing's "nine-dash line" extends more than one thousand kilometers from its southernmost province, taking in more or less the entirety of the waters, through which the United Nations estimates one-third of global shipping passes.

The South China Sea is also believed to contain rich oil and natural gas reserves that have yet to be fully explored.

Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei all claim overlapping portions of the sea which spans 3.6 million square kilometer (1.4 million square miles), but the most far-reaching claims have been made by China.

Beijing's sovereignty claims are considered by most other countries as unsubstantiated, a view backed by an international tribunal in 2016.

Despite this however, little has changed in China's approach to the region in recent years.

To reinforce its claims of sovereignty, Beijing has been reclaiming land on and around reefs and shoals to construct artificial islands which are then militarized with airfields and radar equipment.

China has spent much of the past two years fortifying these islands, including placing missiles on the Spratly island chain during naval exercises in April.

This is despite a promise made by President Xi Jinping to then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that the Chinese government would not be militarizing the artificial islands.

The US Navy's P8-A Poseidon plane which carried a CNN crew from Okinawa, Japan, over the South China Sea on August 10.

Rapid expansion

The last time CNN was given access to a US Navy mission over the South China Sea was in September 2015, when the aircraft was also warned off by Chinese military.

Since then, Beijing's island building in the contested waters has moved forward at a rapid pace.

Flying over Fiery Cross Reef on Friday, a five-story building was visible, as well as a large radar installation, which looked like neatly arranged golf balls on the Navy plane's infrared camera.

Though no Chinese missiles were seen on Friday's flight over the South China Sea, Navy officers said some of the structures seen could potentially be used to house them.

Cmdr. Chris Purcell, who leads Patrol Squadron Four which undertook Friday's mission, said the US has been doing these flights for five decades and they show US commitment to maintaining free passage in international waters.

"The reason we're here hasn't changed," Purcell said. "The reason (the Chinese) are here has changed."

Within hours of the trip, Chinese state tabloid Global Times posted a reaction to CNN's report on its Chinese-language website. The article called for all readers to "give a thumbs-up to Chinese servicemen" for their defense of China's territory.

China claims US sparking militarization

Beijing says its growing military presence in the South China Sea is necessary to protect its sovereignty, blaming Washington and its allies for tensions in the region.

Chinese military exercises in April included the largest naval parade in the country's history, with President Xi Jinping overseeing drills that included 10,000 troops, 48 naval vessels and 76 fighter jets.

Beijing points to the regular US Navy patrols and flyovers of the South China Sea as an example of US militarization and provocations, and a justification for the increased Chinese military presence.

"By playing up the so-called China's militarization in the South China Sea, certain people in the US are staging a farce of a thief crying "stop thief"," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in May . "It is self-evident to a keener eye that who is militarizing the South China Sea."

In the past year, the US has stepped up freedom of navigation operations in the region, sailing US naval vessels within miles of China's artificial islands across the South China Sea.

The exercises , which the US also conducts in other parts of the world, assert the navy's right to travel wherever it pleases in international waters, a vital component of Washington's naval power across the world.

Time may be running out to effectively challenge China's claims in the South China Sea however.

Adm. Philip Davidson, the recently installed head of the US Pacific Command, told Senators during a confirmation hearing in April that China is already very firmly entrenched.

"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States," Davidson said.

Rubona, Rwanda — As a cacophony of birdsong greets the rising sun, Mama Marie Goretti Amurere corrals her daughters from their beds and out the door of their single-story home.

By 6am, Goretti, 60, walks the path from her house to the canteen, flanked by her girls and a lush perimeter of banana trees extending to a horizon of hills.

Inside the cafeteria, she pours rounds of igikoma, a millet porridge, into small plastic cups; it's eaten with fluffy white bread rolls that pass along the communal table. As her bleary-eyed teenagers eat their breakfast, Goretti watches the clock. School starts at 7 a.m. and it's a ten-minute walk up the hill.

It's a morning routine familiar to mothers around the world, but these aren't Goretti's biological children.

Goretti's husband and three of her five children were among 800,000 people killed over the course of 100 days during Rwanda's 1994 genocide.

When the genocide ended, she felt her life was over, but more than 20 years on and with dozens of children calling her "Mama," she says she has a reason to live.

Mama Marie Goretti Amurere, outside her home in the village.

Goretti is one of 28 "Mamas" who live and work at the Agahozo Shalom Youth Village (ASYV), a holistic, educational oasis in Rwanda's lush Rwamagana district, 50 kilometers east of the capital, Kigali.

The village is expansive, with 30 family homes, extracurricular buildings and guest houses laid out in a series of concentric circles across 144 acres.

"I felt it was an honor for me to hear these children call me mom," Goretti, now in her eighth year at ASYV, says.

Derived from a mix of the local Kinyarwanda language and Hebrew, its name translates as "a peaceful place where tears are dried."

The village is modeled after an Israeli youth village -- a family-structured center established after World War II for children orphaned during the Holocaust. In 2008, ASYV opened its gates to its first group of children, some of the country's most vulnerable orphans.

Goretti walks with her teenage daughters to breakfast. The high school sits at the pinnacle of the village.

More than 520 orphaned and disadvantaged teenagers live and study there. Structured around the family unit, groups of 16 to 24 children live among each other as "siblings" in a home headed by a "Mama."

Most of the Mamas are widows and have lost at least one child as a direct or indirect result of the genocide.

Goretti's path to the village wasn't an easy one. Taking on a job that held a title with so much meaning dredged up memories from the darkest moments of her life, which she had tried to bury.

In the April of 1994, Goretti received a chilling phone call after returning home from the post office where she was working as a clerk. The man on the line told her: "They are coming for you, they're going to kill you. You're going to die tonight."

Over the next three months as the genocide unfolded, Goretti saw one daughter killed in front of her and her eldest son beaten within a breath of his life. She hid out in cornfields as she prayed for the children she had been separated from.

Each night through the stalks of maize, the genocidaires, or killers, would announce who they had killed. When Goretti learned that her son and another daughter, her eldest, had been murdered, she emerged from her hideout, ready to die.

"I came out of hiding... but they refused to kill me. They started piercing me with spears all over my head -- they were wanting me to have an emotional reaction, but I wouldn't give it to them. I just stood still," Goretti recalls.

Goretti's biological daughter Fifi, who was killed in 1994. Wildflowers dot a village path. They remind Goretti of her daughter Fifi.

Goretti eventually returned to her hiding place until the violence ended in July 1994.

"We were happy to feel saved even though we had nothing really -- we were really tired and we were looking forward to dying. We were just tired of being in this life," Goretti says.

That sentiment shifted when she learned her two youngest children had survived. They were found in a refugee camp in neighboring Burundi and eventually returned to live with her.

Goretti decided to foster orphans into her home, including those whose parents had been perpetrators of the genocide. It was her duty, she says.

"I felt an obligation to care for them the same way other people would have cared for our own children had we died," Goretti explains.

She provided for some 25 children -- in addition to her two youngest children who survived the genocide -- until 2010.

"The gift I could give to my family that died was raising other children, any child that would come to me," Goretti says.

When the youngest of those orphans was ready to live on their own, she joined ASYV. It was there that she began to heal herself, she says.

The Mamas live with the children throughout their four-year tenure and are the backbone of the village. They provide emotional and logistical support to their children.

After school, one of Mama Goretti's daughters greets her with a hug. The girls are encouraged to share at nightly "family time" sessions.

After classes are done for the day, Goretti gathers with her girls in the living room of her house for an hour of "family time," a nightly session where families share moments from their day and talk through problems.

There's ample time for song, prayer and dance. Ed Sheeran's ballad "Perfect" has become a sing-along staple in the village.

Goretti says her work is not a job.

She doesn't clock in or out. And her shift doesn't end when the kids fall asleep.

"It is a calling. If you come here just for a job, you would simply quit, because it's very difficult to raise children who are not your own, especially when they come from traumatic circumstances. If it wasn't a calling, you would not be able to cope," Goretti says.

When ASYV first opened its doors, the children there had all been orphaned by the genocide. They carried the trauma and pain of a nation. Others were born as a result of rape. An estimated 250,000-500,000 women were raped during the genocide, with some 20,000 children born as a result of that systematic sexual violence, according to the British charity Survivors' Fund.

It's been 24 years since the genocide -- and like Rwanda, the student body continues to evolve. The village now sees children from disparate backgrounds, but they all share an understanding of loss.

Some of the village's current students have been orphaned from retaliatory violence that occurred after the gacaca process -- village tribunals set up to prosecute suspects of the genocide. Other children come from single parent homes who can't afford to send them to school, one indication of the poverty that continues to plague more than 51% of Rwanda's population, according to the World Bank's 2018 projections.

Goretti believes Mamas like herself -- women who have harnessed an inner strength from tragedy -- hold the key to Rwanda's future generation.
__label__world (CNN) For a group of boys in northern Yemen, Thursday was supposed to be a celebration -- a much-anticipated field trip marking their graduation from summer school.

A video taken by one of the boys shows the classmates jostling and yelling on a packed school bus, clearly excited for the day ahead.

Their delighted chatter drowns out the person taking roll call, red pen poised in hand.

A parent outside the window waves goodbye to their child.

Within hours the boy who took the video, along with most of his classmates, would be dead -- killed after a Saudi-led coalition airstrike hit their school bus.

Neighboring Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition of Gulf states against Houthi rebels in northern Yemen since 2015, after the Iran-backed rebels drove out the pro-Saudi and US-backed government.

The children, reportedly ages 6 to 11, had been on a field trip to a graveyard for rebels, one of the few green spaces left in the northern Saada governate.

"Because of the war, most of the parks and gardens are destroyed," explained the boys' 40-year-old teacher, Yahya Hussein. "The nicest areas are the martyr's shrines and mosques," he told CNN.

Osama Zeid Al Homran

"They were so excited about the field trip," Hussein said of the outing, which was to mark the end of the boys' two-month religious summer school. "It's all they had been talking about for the last couple of days."

In the video, filmed by schoolboy Osama Zeid Al Homran, the classmates are shown reciting verses from the Quran. The moment the lesson is over, the children race into the graveyard to play chase.

Zeid can be heard shouting to his friends, "Wait! Let's take a picture!"

'These are just children'

Later in the day, after the boys returned to the school bus, tragedy struck.

Hussein had been late to the field trip and was parking his car a short distance from the bus when the blast came.

A Yemeni child injured in Thursday's airstrike on a schoolbus.

"I heard a loud explosion and there was dust and smoke everywhere," he said. "The scene can't be described -- there was body parts and blood everywhere."

"These were the children that were laughing, playing, acting very excited just a couple of days ago about their field trip. And now they were just mutilated corpses," he said.

"I was frozen," said the father of three. "I just started screaming, 'Oh people, oh world -- these are just children.'"

Of the 51 people who died in the airstrike, 40 were children, Houthi Health Minister Taha al-Mutawakil said during a news conference Friday. He added that of the 79 people wounded, 56 were children.

A Yemeni man mourns over a casket of one of the boys, during Monday's funeral.

Graphic footage of the immediate aftermath of the strike, broadcast by Houthi media, shows the children's charred bodies under the blown-up bus. In one video, a Yemeni father spots his son's corpse partially covered by a blue tarpaulin in the back of a pickup truck.

Houthi TV network Al Masirah reported that one of the first medics on the scene, Hussein Hussein Tayeb, found that his son was one of the dead.

"As soon as I arrived with others wanting to help out, we figured we had to quickly nurse the wounded because there was chaos -- people were running over bodies and shouting," he said.

"As I was nursing people, I lifted a body and found that it was Ahmed's face. I carried him and hugged him -- he was my son."

Mass funeral for boys

On Monday morning hundreds of mourners gathered for a mass funeral for the boys, their small caskets carried through the city of Saada before being loaded onto pickup trucks.

Alongside the caskets stood giant placards bearing the bloodied faces of the children in the aftermath of the attack. Other signs said "America killed the children of Yemen."

The procession, organized by Houthi rebels, was one of several planned to take place across Yemen on Monday.

Yemenis dig graves for the children last week.

Abdel-Ilah Mohammad, the father of 7-year-old victim Mohammad Abdel-Ilah, told CNN that his son had been so excited for the school trip that he got up at 6 a.m.

"We never expected this to happen," he said. "He walked out of the door with his white clothes. He put on perfume and combed his hair before he left; he didn't need to -- he was a handsome boy. He did not know what was coming for him."

Hundreds of people took part in a mass funeral in Saada on Monday.

US general to aid investigation

US Defense Secretary James Mattis said Sunday that, while he backed the US State Department's calls for the Saudi-led coalition to investigate the strike, he is sending a general to help with inquiries.

"I have dispatched a three-star general into Riyadh to look into what happened here and if there is anything we can do to preclude this in the future," Mattis said.

The state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Friday that the Saudi-led coalition had opened an investigation into the attack.

The school bus destroyed in Thursday's airstrike.

Saudi Arabia denies targeting civilians and defended the incident on Thursday as a "legitimate military operation" and a retaliatory response to a Houthi ballistic missile that targeted the kingdom's Jizan province the day before.

Coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki told CNN the airstrike that hit the bus was aimed at a "legitimate target."

"No, this is not children in the bus," he said. "We do have high standard measures for targeting."

Thursday's strike was the worst attack on children since Yemen's brutal war escalated in 2015, UNICEF said Friday.

UN calls for investigation

UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the attack and called for "an independent and prompt investigation" into the strike.

Guterres said in a statement that all parties must "respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the fundamental rules of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack."

One of the children injured in Thursday's attack.

The war in Yemen is now the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people -- three-quarters of the population -- in desperate need of aid and protection, according to the United Nations.

More than 10,000 civilians have died and 40,000 have been wounded in the war, which reportedly has left 15 million Yemenis without access to clean water.
__label__politics Bloomington, Indiana (CNN) When it comes to hobbies, Josh Russell concedes he gets a little obsessive. No matter his interest, be it videogames or miniature figurine board games, he always wants to be the best. Perhaps that explains the dedication he's shown to his latest pastime: Hunting Russian trolls.

By day, the 39-year-old father of two works as a systems analyst and programmer at Indiana University. Once the kids are tucked in, he spends hours scouring social media to unmask the operatives behind the disinformation campaigns roiling Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.

Russell is part of a growing network of online sleuths using public information to conduct open source investigations into Russian accounts posing as Americans. Officially, their work is called open-source intelligence, or OSINT, and it often identifies trolls before the platforms do. Russell's work in particular has helped journalists at CNN, NBC News, The Daily Beast, and other outlets cut through the lies and disinformation.

"My main motivation is to kind of help people understand what happened," Russell says. "Just documenting what happened and that what different bots may have been up to on Twitter, so people can see and look at the data for themselves and maybe think, 'I've been consuming this disinformation and maybe I should stop."

Russell's interest in troll hunting started in the waning weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, when he started investigating some of the most slanderous lies circulating online about Hillary Clinton. He'd been leaning toward voting for Donald Trump, but realized he could not find any evidence supporting some of the most outlandish allegations against Clinton circulating on Twitter.

__label__world (CNN) For decades, mystery has swirled around what happened to the founding population of the remote Easter Island, known for its towering stone statues depicting large carved heads. A long-held theory suggests that after the islanders set up camp and carved the giant statues, they destroyed their own society through infighting and a depletion of natural resources.

But a new study suggests a different scenario entirely, and the islanders could have a more complex history than previously believed.

Many aspects of the island, the statues and the Polynesian seafarers who arrived there 900 years ago have been studied over the years. But a study published Monday in the Journal of Pacific Archaeology uses multiple data sets from recent excavations to provide a better understanding of the society that created the statues and how they were carved.

So the researchers used an unlikely method to study the society and discern what might have happened: a chemical analysis of stone tools used on the statues.

What they learned from excavating four of the statues and the volcanic stone basalt tools used to carve them painted a different picture: a sophisticated and collaborative society.

"The idea of competition and collapse on Easter Island might be overstated," said lead study author Dale Simpson Jr., an archaeologist at the University of Queensland, in a statement. "To me, the stone carving industry is solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups."

Moai are spread across the landscape of Easter Island.

A complex society

Easter Island is 2,300 miles off the coast of Chile. About 900 years ago, the founding population landed on the island, called Rapa Nui in the local language. These Polynesian seafarers came on two canoes and were led by Hotu Matu'a, who would become the island's first chief, according to oral tradition.

The population soared to include thousands of people, and they carved full-body figures, called moai, to represent important Rapa Nui ancestors. There are nearly a thousand statues, many buried up to their heads due to the passage of time. The largest statue is over 70 feet tall.

Their sheer size and number is indicative of a complex, sophisticated society, according to the researchers.

"Ancient Rapa Nui had chiefs, priests, and guilds of workers who fished, farmed, and made the moai. There was a certain level of sociopolitical organization that was needed to carve almost a thousand statues," Simpson said.

During the statue excavations, Jo Anne Van Tilburg, director of the Easter Island Statue Project, and her Rapa Nui excavation team recovered about 1,600 stone tools. They did a close chemical and mass spectrometer analysis of fragments from 17 of the tools, called toki.

"We wanted to figure out where the raw materials used to manufacture the artifacts came from," said Laure Dussubieux, a study co-author and Field Museum scientist, in a statement. "We wanted to know if people were taking material from close to where they lived."

The location is key because there are three sources, or quarries, where the islanders could have gathered material for tools. The basalt quarries cover the size of two football fields. Basalt samples reveal their sources through their chemical elements, which link back to the geology of the site.

"The majority of the toki came from one quarry complex -- once the people found the quarry they liked, they stayed with it," Simpson said. "For everyone to be using one type of stone, I believe they had to collaborate. That's why they were so successful -- they were working together."

Looking ahead

This contrasts with the idea that the residents ran out of resources and fought amongst themselves, the researchers said. But later on, it is believed that the arrival of colonists and the institution of slavery decimated the population.

"There's so much mystery around Easter Island, because it's so isolated, but on the island, people were, and still are, interacting in huge amounts," Simpson said. "There are thousands of Rapa Nui people alive today -- the society isn't gone."

But the researchers also urge caution and believe that this study is just the beginning, laying the groundwork for more research.

"The near exclusive use of one quarry to produce these seventeen tools supports a view of craft specialization based on information exchange, but we can't know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative," Van Tilburg said. "It may also have been coercive in some way. Human behavior is complex. This study encourages further mapping and stone sourcing, and our excavations continue to shed new light on moai carving."
__label__world (CNN) Ethiopian Airlines is the frontrunner to manage Nigeria's new national carrier, its chief executive has announced.

Nigeria unveiled plans for Nigeria Air, its new airline last month, and Minister of State for Aviation, Hadi Sirika indicated that it was in the market for investors to manage the carrier.

After enjoying a very successful financial year in which it carried its 10 millionth passenger, Ethiopian Airlines claims it is in the lead to take that role.

"We are among a small group with an interest in establishing a national carrier (in Nigeria)...we do not know the results (of the tender), though we are frontrunners," Chief Executive Tewolde Gebremariam told a news conference in Ethiopia's capital.

The decision to make Nigeria Air a public-private partnership, 15 years after the last national carrier ceased operations, allayed fears in the country over the government's ability to sustain an airline because of the country's patchy history with previous national carriers.

__label__world Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) A Nigerian radio station has been fined for broadcasting "vulgar lyrics" in Nigerian rapper Falz 'This is Nigeria' viral hit song.

The song has "indecent and vulgar" lyrics, Nigeria's National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) said in a letter to the radio station.

Falz 'This is Nigeria' hit song has more than 12 million views on Youtube and has been hailed for its searing political commentary on Nigeria's challenges.

Its music video, a cover version of Childish Gambino's viral video, 'This is America' shone a spotlight on Nigeria's opioid crisis, the missing Chibok school girls and escalating pastoral conflict in the country's central states.

When it was released, the song garnered global attention including a reaction from American hip-hop musician and entrepreneur Diddy, who shared it on his Instagram page, giving the video worldwide recognition.

__label__world (CNN) For the first two years of life, a baby elephant needs about 42 gallons of its mother's milk to survive each week. For orphaned elephants that lose their parents to poaching or drought, figuring out how to fulfill his daily necessity is the difference between life or death.

Dame Daphne Sheldrick worked to solve this puzzle for 28 years. With pantry items like baby formula and coconut milk, Sheldrick discovered the right mix to mimic a mother elephant's milk and changed the fate of elephant populations around the world.

Few orphans survived before Sheldrick got involved. She was the first person in the world to successfully raise newborn elephant orphans , an animal that she saw as almost-human.

Known as the "Mama Elephant" of Kenya, Sheldrick rescued and rehabilitated more than 230 orphaned baby elephants throughout her life.

She died after a long battle with cancer in April.

Breaking the mold

While stories from the Kenyan wilderness often bring images of tall boots and khaki work suits, Sheldrick broke the mold. Her wardrobe of flowing floral dresses embodied her bright spirit, even while tending to her parade of baby elephants in the wild.

"So many people think a life in Africa is about khaki, and Daphne was always about beautiful, glamorous dresses. In the mud bath with a baby elephant," Sheldrick's daughter Angela told CNN while perusing family photos that show a woman unafraid of getting her hands dirty.

Born on a farm in 1934, Sheldrick was educated in Nairobi at the Kenya High School for Girls. She graduated among the top of her class and was offered a medical scholarship, but left schooling behind to marry her first husband.

Daphne's love led her to Tsavo National Park, where her husband worked as an assistant warden. It's also where she would meet her second husband, the founding warden of the park, David Sheldrick. The two were married in 1960.

Together, David and Daphne built Tsavo, carving out 22,000 square kilometers of park from Kenya's wilderness, forging what is still Kenya's largest protected area.

When David died in 1977 at only 57 years old, Daphne pressed on. While raising their two daughters, Angela and Jill, she founded the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in her husband's name and fell in love again: this time, with a band of baby elephants.

In a 2013 interview, Sheldrick said that when David died, she thought she'd have a quiet life and maybe write children's books. "I didn't really know what I was going to do. But it just happened upon me. The orphans started coming. The elephants started coming in."

Today, 93 elephants live at the sanctuary that Sheldrick worked tirelessly to establish. Each elephant rescued gets five pints of milk every three hours, day and night.

A huge undertaking

As CEO of the wildlife trust, Angela says the orphan project is a "huge" undertaking, but they've grown to do much more.

"Without taking care of the bigger picture, [raising elephants] would be futile," Angela said. "So, we need to know that when these baby elephants go back into the wild, we have the resources in place... to make sure that they're protected for the future."

Eleven anti-poaching teams and five veterinary units patrol Tsavo and other protected areas, Angela said. The ultimate goal is for rescued elephants to raise wild-born babies of their own, each helping to rebuild Kenya's elephant population, she said.

The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust also visits schools in Kenya to educate and inspire the next generation of conservationists.

"We go to the schools to educate the children," Edwin Lusichi, the Wildlife Trust's head caretaker, said. "They need to know why the animals are important... to see and learn more about conservation and wildlife. It's only these children that will actually make or break the future of the animals."

Known the world over for her groundbreaking conservation work with Kenya's wildlife, Dame Daphne Sheldrick's legacy lives on in the countless projects and citizens she has inspired.

"I don't really think there's a baby elephant raised anywhere in the world without some collaborative arrangement with Daphne's early pioneering work," her daughter Angela said.

'A meek and mild lady'

The Reteti Elephant Sanctuary Community United for Elephants (R.E.S.C.U.E.) is one project inspired by Sheldrick. Working in the forests of remote northern Kenya, it's the first-ever community-owned elephant rescue organization.

R.E.S.C.U.E. co-founder Robert Lemayian said his tribe, the Samburu people, feel a special connection to Sheldrick's work.

"As a tribe, we've always had that relationship with elephants," Lemayian said. "Many of our elephants have been taken from here, taken to the Sheldricks, and they've survived."

Outreach in schools and sister sanctuaries is an ongoing initiative for the Wildlife Trust. Angela said that were David Sheldrick still alive, he would be proud of his wife and the impact of her work.

"In his lifetime... she was actually a very shy and meek and mild lady," Angela said. "In the wake of his death, she has emerged as this giant in terms of pursuing his dreams and visions and making so much of his visions for the future a reality," she said.

With her mother's passing, Angela knows she needs to do the same.

"I hear her voice, 'Step up. Get up,' and you know, 'Deal with the job,'" Angela said. "That's what we all have to do."
__label__world (CNN) Australia is once again debating the nation's attitudes toward immigrants amid an outcry over comments made by a little-known senator who used his maiden speech in the country's Parliament to call for a "final solution" to immigration.

As condemnation poured in from all political sides, the party's leader Bob Katter inflamed matters further by describing the speech as "magnificent."

Bob Katter speaks on the steps of Parliament House on May 25, 2016.

"Absolutely, 1000%, I support everything he said," Katter told reporters during a news conference in the northern city of Cairns Wednesday. "It was solid gold... It is everything that this country should be doing."

In his speech, Anning referred to the infamous White Australia policy, which effectively banned non-European migrants in the mid-20th century, and invoked the term "the final solution," which the Nazis used to describe their genocide of Jews in Europe.

Condemnation across the spectrum

Anning's speech was immediately condemned by MPs of all political stripes. In a statement on Wednesday , Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull denounced Anning's "racist remarks," and praised the country's multiculturalism.

"The reference in Senator Anning's speech to the 'final solution' is a shocking, shocking insult to the memory of over 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust," said Turnbull, adding that it was important "to call out racism."

Well said Alan. Australia is the most successful multicultural society in the world built on a foundation of mutual respect. We reject and condemn racism in any form. https://t.co/RHslbs1FNs — Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) August 14, 2018

Even One Nation Party leader Pauline Hanson, who called for a ban on immigration in her maiden Senate speech in 2016, called Anning's comments "straight from Goebbels' handbook from Nazi Germany."

Anning's comments had "nothing to do with me," Hanson said, distancing herself from the senator, who is a former member of the One Nation Party.

Other political leaders spoke out, including Anne Aly, Australia's first Muslim MP.

"I'm tired of fighting," she said, breaking down in tears as she addressed the chamber Wednesday. "I'm tired of having to stand up against hate, against vilification, time and time and time again."

"(Parliament) is united today in condemnation of those terrible words that were spoken in the other place yesterday."

The extraordinary Anne Aly. pic.twitter.com/NHPXGnT4E5 — Jason Clare MP (@JasonClareMP) August 15, 2018

The Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) also released a statement on Wednesday, calling Anning's language "beyond deplorable" and demanding a "full and unreserved apology."

Anning has remained defiant and unapologetic, and claims his words were taken out of context.

"Claims that the words meant anything other than the 'ultimate solution' to any political question is always a popular vote are simply ridiculous," he said in a statement.

"Some in the media and leftwing politicians are simply afraid of the Australian people having a say on who comes here. As I called for a plebiscite on the immigration mix, this baseless and ridiculous criticism is simply an effort to play the man and not the ball," Anning said.

Katter said he believed Anning hadn't intended to evoke Nazi sentiment when crafting his speech, as the former farmer had spent his life "building pipelines" and "didn't go to university."

"The thrust is that the Jewish people in this country are to be protected," Katter said. "Don't you, with your hypocrisy, say you're protecting them -- you're bringing people into this country dedicated to their destruction and their annihilation," he told reporters.

The outrage over Anning's comments follows fury earlier this month after broadcaster Sky News aired an interview with far-right agitator Blair Cottrell, who once called for a portrait of Adolf Hitler to be hung "in every (Australian) classroom and every school."

Sky News later conceded it was "wrong" to give Cottrell air time and pulled recordings of the 10-minute interview from its website.

In a speech to the Whitlam Institute in Sydney the day after the interview aired, Australia's outgoing Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane said, "I take no pleasure in saying this, but, right now, it feels like there has never been a more exciting time to be a dog-whistling politician or race-baiting commentator in Australia."
__label__world Tehran, Iran (CNN) Davood Taraji stands by the refrigerator, listing the price rises that have slowly emptied his otherwise swanky, double-doored appliance over the past weeks.

"The price of an egg has doubled, and milk is about 40% more expensive," he says, putting a half-empty bottle back into the chill. "Fruit and vegetables have gone up 100%."

This is the everyday world of a Tehran taxi driver, caught up in the onslaught of the Trump administration's policy toward Iran and the country's economic slide.

Taraji has been particularly hard-hit as he drives a foreign car, a Toyota, and spare parts for these are under renewed American sanctions that kicked in a week earlier. This means mending the family business is now impossible to afford. The local currency has dropped to a third of its value in 2017, and their plush, yet tiny, two-room apartment feels it hard.

"It's caused us to work longer days to make ends meet," he says. Their home may soon be up for sale if these hardships continue. But he worries most about the education of his children, Artin, 7, who dutifully recites from his English textbook, and Asal, 13, who plays a gentle Siciliana riff on her acoustic guitar.

__label__world (CNN) One year after Sierra Leone suffered a devastating mudslide that wiped out entire communities in its capital, survivors say they are are struggling to afford meals and decent accommodation.

Survivors who lost their livelihoods say they have no source of income to rebuild their lives.

In the aftermath of the disaster, the government provided temporary accommodation for survivors. They also gave cash to others who opted to find alternative housing for their families.

Pawa Koroma, 58, said he was given the equivalent of $300 by the government to rent a home for his family of nine.

But despite that intervention, challenges remain. His rent is coming due, and he fears his family could be out on the streets again.

"We are stranded again, and I have no source of income to renew this rent. We can barely afford a meal a day," he said.

On Wednesday night, families and survivors dressed in symbolic black-and-white clothing returned to the areas where thousands of homes were washed away

Hundreds of people gathered to pray during a candlelight memorial held for those who died in one of the worst natural disasters to hit the West African nation.

Emotions ran high as a children's choir sang at the service organized by the Movement for Restoration for Mudslide Victims Organization.

Families wept as victims' names were read out during the memorial.

People gather at a memorial held for mudslide victims in Freetown on August, 15, 2018.

The mudslide happened after torrents of mud water triggered by heavy rains and flooding brought the side of Mount Sugar Loaf crashing into shanty towns below the hillside.

Mudslide survivor Pawa Koroma worries his family may soon be on the streets again.

Koroma says the horrors of that fateful day still haunt him.

He barely managed to get his wife and eight children to safety before the flood water buried his home.

The carpenter said he was preparing for prayers in the early hours of that day when he saw torrents of muddy water charging toward his home in Lumley, one of the areas most affected by the disaster.

"I have never seen that much water, people were screaming while it carried them. I was shouting to wake people up; unfortunately, many were sleeping," he said.

He lost his younger sister, Fatu, who lived in the same community.

Koroma believes she was swept away in the landslides that tore through thousands of homes.

"I tried to get to her house, but everybody was running to get away from the water. I searched mortuaries after the incident. I did not find her. I went back to her house, it was no longer there," Koroma said.

Aminata Bissa's home and grocery shop were buried in the landslides.

Aminata Bissa was asleep as deadly floods headed toward her house on the base of the hill.

"Water is coming, water is coming, get out," she heard and quickly dragged her two children out of bed.

Regent, a Freetown neighborhood, has witnessed many devastating mudslides caused by years of deforestation and flooding.

Bissa, 29, said her home and shop, where she sold groceries to the community, were buried in the landslides.

She has since resettled with her family in Kamayama, a community close to areas affected in last year's landslides.

Like Koroma, she may soon become homeless.

"My rent expires next month, where do I go with two children? Everyone I know has lost either their home and businesses in the mudslide," Bissa said.

The government is addressing housing challenges facing those displaced by the floods, but requests have been overwhelming, a lawmaker told CNN.

"The level of destruction by the mudslides is shocking, and we are still working every day to get people back on their feet," Ibrahim Conteh said.

But none of these challenges compares to the loss suffered by those who lost family members.

"Till now, I have not seen my elder sister and her two children. I have checked mortuaries, and I have not set my eyes on her body," Bissa said.

Sierra Leone has endured many tragedies, but the August mudslides brought a new low to the country still reeling from an Ebola crisis that claimed 4,000 lives in 2014.

Around 20,000 people were displaced, including 5,000 children, according to government officials.

The desolation suffered by those affected drew humanitarian responses from around the world . International agencies and NGOs opened shelters across the country to house thousands of affected families.

Sierra Leone is prone to natural disasters, especially recurring floods and landslides, provoked by climate change.

The country ranks among 15 countries most vulnerable to disaster globally.
__label__world (CNN) The bomb used by the Saudi-led coalition in a devastating attack on a school bus in Yemen was sold as part of a US State Department-sanctioned arms deal with Saudi Arabia, munitions experts told CNN.

Working with local Yemeni journalists and munitions experts, CNN has established that the weapon that left dozens of children dead on August 9 was a 500-pound (227 kilogram) laser-guided MK 82 bomb made by Lockheed Martin, one of the top US defense contractors.

The bomb is very similar to the one that wreaked devastation in an attack on a funeral hall in Yemen in October 2016 in which 155 people were killed and hundreds more wounded. The Saudi coalition blamed "incorrect information" for that strike, admitted it was a mistake and took responsibility.

In March of that year, a strike on a Yemeni market -- this time reportedly by a US-supplied precision-guided MK 84 bomb -- killed 97 people.

In the aftermath of the funeral hall attack, former US President Barack Obama banned the sale of precision-guided military technology to Saudi Arabia over "human rights concerns."

The ban was overturned by the Trump administration's then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in March 2017.

As the US-backed Saudi-led coalition scrambles to investigate the strike on the school bus, questions are growing from observers and rights groups about whether the US bears any moral culpability. The US says it does not make targeting decisions for the coalition, which is fighting a Houthi rebel insurgency in Yemen. But it does support its operations through billions of dollars in arms sales, the refueling of Saudi combat aircraft and some sharing of intelligence.

"I will tell you that we do help them plan what we call, kind of targeting," said US Secretary of Defense James Mattis. "We do not do dynamic targeting for them."

A man mourns over the casket of one of the children killed in the strike.

The latest strike has left the community in Yemen's northern Saada governorate reeling.

Zeid Al Homran visits the graveyard where his two little boys are buried every day. On this occasion, he brought their five-year-old brother along. He is all Al Homran has left.

"I was screaming in anger and all around me women were throwing themselves on the ground," he told CNN. "People were screaming out the names of their children. I tried to tell the women it couldn't be true but then a man ran through the crowd shouting that a plane had struck the children's bus."

A photo shows Osama Zeid Al Homran, who took cell phone footage inside the bus before it was hit in a strike that killed him and dozens of his peers.

'Bodies scattered everywhere'

The bomb's impact as it landed on the bus full of excited schoolchildren on a day trip was devastating.

Of the 51 people who died in the airstrike, 40 were children, Houthi Health Minister Taha al-Mutawakil said last week. He added that of the 79 people wounded, 56 were children.

Eyewitnesses told CNN it was a direct hit in the middle of a busy market.

"I saw the bomb hit the bus," one witness said. "It blew it into those shops and threw the bodies clear to the other side of those buildings. We found bodies scattered everywhere, there was a severed head inside the bomb crater. When we found that, that was when I started running. I was so afraid."

Some of the bodies were so mutilated that identification became impossible. Left behind were scraps of schoolbooks, warped metal and a single backpack.

Munitions experts said the numbers on this piece of shrapnel confirmed that Lockheed Martin was the maker of the bomb.

Images of shrapnel filmed in the immediate aftermath of the attack were sent to CNN by a contact in Saada. Subsequently, a cameraman working for CNN filmed footage of the shrapnel after the cleanup operation had begun.

Munitions experts confirmed that the numbers on it identified Lockheed Martin as its maker and that this particular MK 82 was a Paveway, a laser-guided bomb.

Asked to comment on CNN's evidence, coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said: "The democratically elected government of Yemen has been displaced by an Iranian-backed insurgency by minority Houthi militias."

Yemeni children receive treatment at a hospital after being wounded in the August 9 strike.

"The coalition is in Yemen with the support of the UN Security Council to restore the legitimate government. The coalition is operating in accordance with international humanitarian law, taking all practical measures to minimize civilian casualties. Every civilian casualty is a tragedy."

He added that it would not "be appropriate for the coalition to comment further while the investigation is underway."

Saudi Arabia denies targeting civilians and defended the incident as a "legitimate military operation" and a retaliatory response to a Houthi ballistic missile from the day before.

A Pentagon spokeswoman, Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, declined to confirm the provenance of the bomb.

"The US has worked with the Saudi-led coalition to help them improve procedures and oversight mechanisms to reduce civilian casualties," she said.

"While we do not independently verify claims of civilian casualties in which we are not directly involved, we call on all sides to reduce such casualties, including those caused via ballistic missile attacks on civilian population centers in Saudi Arabia."

The United Nations has called for a separate investigation into the strike, one of the deadliest since Yemen's war began in early 2015. Since then, the Saudi-led coalition has battled rebels in support of exiled President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Greater US oversight

There have been growing calls in the US Congress for Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, to do more to cut civilian deaths in Yemen, where three years of conflict have taken a terrible toll.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump signed a defense spending bill that includes a clause requiring the Pentagon and State Department to certify that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, another key coalition member, are doing enough to reduce civilian casualties. This report must be submitted to Congress within 180 days and then annually for the next two years.

The US, alongside the UK and France, is a major supplier of arms to Saudi Arabia.

Trump signed a nearly $110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in May last year in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on what was his first stop abroad as President.

In the same month, the US government reauthorized the export of Paveway munitions to Saudi Arabia, ending Obama's December 2016 ban.

Retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, who served as a spokesman for the State Department and Pentagon under Obama, said the Saudis had a right to defend themselves against missile attacks from the Iranian-backed Houthis but that the Obama administration did not believe they were striking the right balance between that need and proper care for civilian life.

Asked whether the US had moral complicity in the deaths in Yemen, he said: "The issue of complicity is one that international lawyers probably are best to work out, not somebody like me."

"What I would tell you is that we certainly had under the Obama administration deep concerns about the way the Saudis were targeting, and we acted on those concerns by limiting the kinds of munitions that they were being given and stridently trying to argue for them to be more careful and cautious."

People gather on August 12 at the site of the deadly airstrike in Saada.

'Legitimate military action'

In the immediate aftermath of the strike, al-Maliki, the coalition spokesman, told CNN it had been aimed at a "legitimate target."

"No, this is not children in the bus," he said. "We do have high standard measures for targeting."

The Saudi ambassador to the UN, Abdullah Al-Mouallimi, similarly told the Security Council this week that the strike was a "legitimate military action" and that "the targeted Houthi leaders were responsible for recruiting and training young children and sending them to battlefields."

"We are not engaged in the civil war. We will help to prevent, you know, the killing of innocent people. I'm very concerned about the humanitarian situation," US Defense Secretary James Mattis said Sunday when asked about the strike. "Wars are always tragic, but we've got to find a way to protect the innocent in the midst of this one."

Despite a lack of public condemnation over the school bus strike, there are signs that the Trump administration is taking action behind the scenes.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the Saudi-led strike with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a call on Monday. A three-star US general also raised the matter while in Saudi Arabia to meet with the Saudi government and other coalition partners, the Pentagon said.

"The real key is whether or not the Pentagon can help change the calculus, the thinking, inside the Saudi military," said Kirby.
__label__world Rome (CNN) Mourners remembered 18 of the victims of the deadly bridge collapse in the northern Italian city of Genoa at a joint state funeral service on Saturday that was reportedly boycotted by some families amid anger against the government.

At least 43 people died when a section of the Morandi Bridge -- a vital link of the A10 highway that connects northwest Italy to France and one of the busiest bridges in Italy -- suddenly plummeted to the ground on Tuesday.

President Sergio Materella, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and Vice Prime ministers Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio were among the politicians to attend the funeral service at a convention center in the city, led by the city's archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco.

Each of the 18 coffins -- including one small, white one for a child -- was decorated with mounds of flowers. Families and survivors sat by the caskets, many of which also had a photo of the victim.

Mourners gave a standing ovation as a number of first responders, in uniform, arrived for the service. Many of them stopped to kiss the coffins as they passed by. Those gathered also applauded when the names of the dead were read out.

__label__world (CNN) A group of mostly elderly South Koreans crossed into North Korea Monday to reunite with family members many haven't seen nor heard from since the Korean War broke out 68 years ago.

The reunions are the first since 2015, agreed to under the Panmunjom Declaration signed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an historic summit earlier this year.

More than 57,000 people had been hoping to take part in the reunions, but of those only 93 families were selected, four of whom had to pull out at the last minute due to health reasons.

More than 60% of those seeking reunions are over 80 years old, and are being accompanied on the bus trip north by their children and other relatives.

Long awaited reunions

The South Koreans gathered Sunday at the Hanwha resort hotel, in Sokcho, south of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which separates the two Koreas, where medical checks were carried out and participants were warned about nuances of visiting North Korea. They're told to avoid saying anything that could be misconstrued, or considered insensitive north of the border.

Participants were applauded by Red Cross workers as they arrived, some in wheelchairs, passing under banners reading "We sincerely congratulate the reunions of the separated families!"

In the hotel there was an air of excitement and tension as they prepared to meet husbands, wives, brothers, sisters and children who are now only vague memories, their faces blurred by time.

They then registered their names and were invited to take a professional family photo in a corner of the lobby. It was then framed for them so they could then take it to North Korea as a gift.

South Korean participants of the inter-Korean family reunions stand for the national anthem as they undergo a briefing on the eve of the departure for North Korea, at a hotel resort in Sokcho on August 19, 2018.

Lee Keum-seom, who was preparing to see her son for the first time since he was four years old, said she had prayed for him to have a long life so the pair -- now 92 and 72 respectively -- could reunite.

"(My family) in North Korea didn't live long so I prayed for my son's health," she said.

She felt nervous about meeting her now elderly son, after only knowing him as a small child, unsure about where to start catching up on a lifetime spent apart.

"What shall I ask?" she said. "Oh, I should ask him what his father told him about me. His father must have told him about how we got separated and where our house used to be. I should ask him about that."

Park Kyung-seo, president of the South Korean Red Cross, told CNN that while he was overjoyed to be assisting in family reunions, the small number of those taking part was a "human tragedy."

"I share fully with the disappointment of those who are not selected so I am trying with North Korean partners to try and find other solutions, huge numbers are waiting, the numbers are very much limited," he said.

"Imagine 73 years long without knowing whether their family members are still alive or passed away -- no news at all. The agony and anger, that's an unthinkable human tragedy."

A convoy of buses carrying participants of an inter-Korean family reunion makes its way through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) towards North Korea.

Ahn Seung-chun was headed to North Korea to see family members she's never met. "I applied to see my older brother," he said. "But he passed so I'll never see him now."

"I'm going to see my nephew and my brother's wife," she added. On one hand, I'm sad that I won't see my brother. But on the other hand, I'm happy to meet the nephew. At least I will be meeting a fruit of my father."

Dokgo Ran was separated from his entire immediate family during the Korean War, and never expected to see them again.

"The Red Cross asked around for my family and helped me reunite. I'm grateful," he said.

Dozens of elderly and frail South Koreans set off for North Korea on August 20 to meet relatives for the first time since they were separated nearly seven decades ago by a war that divided the peninsula and their families.

Bittersweet process

In the decades since the Korean War, the Red Cross has reunited many families but thousands of others have missed out.

As family members age, each delay adds to fears that they'll no longer be around to finally meet with their long lost relatives. More than 75,000 applicants have already passed away since the reunion process began.

One protester attended Sunday's event to voice his elderly father's case for a reunion, after the man was unlucky this round.

"I don't know when he will die. He is beginning to show signs of dementia. Before he loses everything, he wants to go too," Kim Seong-jin said. "But all he can do is to watch through television each time and get hurt."

Amid all the joy and happy scenes on both sides of the border this week, this is the reality for most whose families remain split by the Korean War.

"My father is all alone here in the South. Can you imagine how much he misses his family?" Kim said. "He wants to hear the news of his hometown before he dies."

Legacy of war

The pain felt by the families split by the Korean War is one of the most visible legacies of the conflict which, 68 years after it began, still hasn't technically ended

An armistice agreement which paused fighting in 1953 never became a formal peace treaty, and small skirmishes have happened since on either side of the heavily fortified DMZ, even as North Korea has built up its nuclear armaments and the US has maintained a heavy military presence in the South.

Officially ending the war was a key element of the Panmunjom Declaration, and both North and South have said they are continuing to work towards that goal, even as negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington appear to have stalled.

North Korean state media called on the US to agree to an official end to the war last week, saying it was a "preliminary and essential process to pave the ground for detente and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula."

"The U.S. should implement phased and simultaneous measures, like the end-of-war declaration, to build mutual trust and make a breakthrough in the security of the world," state media Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary.

As well as the family reunions, Saturday saw the fulfillment of another commitment made by Moon and Kim, as a joint Korean team marched in the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.

That move came after a unified Korean team took part in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea earlier this year, negotiations over which helped kick start a breakthrough in North-South relations and lead to the current detente on the Peninsula.
__label__world (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin was a guest at the Austrian foreign minister's wedding on Saturday, in a move that opposition politicians say undermines the European Union's position on Moscow.

Putin dropped in on Karin Kneissl's wedding in a remote area of southern Austria, on his way to a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in neighboring Germany later that day.

The Russian president was pictured dancing with Kneissl, who was dressed in a traditional "dirndl" dress, in a vineyard in Styria province.

Putin arrived with a bouquet of flowers and even brought a Cossack choir with him to entertain the bride and her groom, the entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS.

__label__world (CNN) Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed a new law on Saturday tightening the government's control of the internet, state media reported.

Aimed at combating extremism, the Anti-Cyber and Information Technology Crimes legislation prohibits the "promotion of the ideas of terrorist organizations" and allows authorities to block websites deemed by judges to be threats to national security.

It also bans the dissemination of information on the movement of security forces and imposes strict punishments for hacking government information systems, according to the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper.

The legislation was originally approved by the Egyptian parliament in May.

Since taking power in 2014, Sisi's government has been criticized for blocking critical voices in the media and scrubbing digital content. Nearly 500 websites have already been blocked in Egypt since May 2017, according to the Cairo-based Association of Freedom of Thought and Expression.

__label__world Tehran, Iran (CNN) The United States is addicted to applying sanctions on Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Sunday in an exclusive interview from Tehran.

"I believe there is a disease in the United States and that is the addiction to sanctions," he told CNN, adding that, "Even during the Obama administration the United States put more emphasis on keeping the sanctions it had not lifted rather than implementing its obligation on the sanctions it lifted."

The interview is the first the key architect of the complex nuclear deal between Iran and the West has given to Western media since some of the US sanctions against Iran were renewed last week. The US-educated minister gave the interview in fluent English on the 65th anniversary of a US-backed coup that overthrew democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.

Zarif retained a clear belief during the hourlong interview in the foreign ministry that the nuclear deal could be revived regardless of the Trump administration denunciation of it. In May, Trump withdrew from the deal, known as the JCPOA and intended to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief, calling it a "horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made." The first wave of sanctions that were to "snap back" under the Trump move hit the import of car parts and precious metals on August 6.

__label__world Beijing (CNN) Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad struck a conciliatory tone during his visit to Beijing Monday, a stark contrast to his earlier sharp language on China.

In the past year, Mahathir has spoken harshly about Chinese investment in his country, alleging that his predecessor hurt Malaysia's sovereignty by signing multibillion-dollar deals with China.

But on Monday, the Malaysian leader said his nation could "learn a lot" from Beijing. "I believe in cooperation with China because China has got a lot that will be beneficial to us," Mahathir told reporters after holding talks in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

For his part, Li said both sides were willing to further expand trade between China and Malaysia. "China is willing to further increase imports of Malaysian goods to satisfy the needs of the Chinese market," the Chinese premier said.

The 93-year-old Malaysian leader started his five-day visit on Friday. He toured a Chinese car plant and e-commerce giant Alibaba, and rode China's fastest high-speed train from the tech hub of Hangzhou to Shanghai, before arriving at the Chinese capital.

__label__world (CNN) Kofi Annan, the first black African to lead the United Nations, has died at age 80. He served as Secretary-General at a time when worries about the Cold War were replaced by threats of global terrorism, and his efforts to combat those threats and secure a more peaceful world brought him the Nobel Peace Prize.

Annan, who was born in Ghana in 1938, served as the seventh UN Secretary-General, from 1997 to 2006, and was the first to rise from within the ranks of the United Nations staff.

He had also been a member, since 2007, of The Elders, a humanitarian group of a dozen leaders and activists of worldwide stature formed by Nelson Mandela. In 2013, Annan became its chairman.

The Kofi Annan Foundation confirmed his death with "immense sadness" in a statement posted on Twitter.

Annan passed away peacefully Saturday morning after a short illness, with his wife Nane and their three children by his side during his final days, the statement said.

The foundation paid tribute to Annan as a "global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer, more peaceful world."

"During his distinguished career and leadership of the United Nations, he was an ardent champion of peace, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law."

Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the United Nations in 2001 " for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world ."

Despite his many achievements, Annan's record was not unblemished. He was head of the United Nations' peacekeeping operations in 1994, when some 800,000 people were killed in the Rwanda genocide, and in 1995 when thousands of Muslim men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica.

Annan would later say that he should have done more to prevent what unfolded in Rwanda, and that events there and in Srebrenica had reshaped his global thinking.

Tributes pour in

As news of Annan's death has spread, many are paying tribute to a man who became a global figure as head of the United Nations but was also known by those close to him for his warmth, style and charm.

Current UN Secretary-General António Guterres told CNN that Annan had been "an enormous source of inspiration" to him, adding that the late leader had been committed to his principles and values even if he had to pay a heavy price for them.

"He was not only a statesman, he was not only a leader, he was a warm person who would support his friends in difficult moments. He was a true colleague and a true friend," he said.

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Annan "worked tirelessly to unite us and never stopped fighting for the dignity of every person."

"Kofi Annan devoted his life to making the world a more peaceful place through his compassion and dedication to service," she added.

The UN Migration Agency tweeted: "Today we mourn the loss of a great man, a leader, and a visionary."

UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said he was "grief-stricken" over Annan's death. "Kofi was humanity's best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace," he said. "In a world now filled with leaders who are anything but that, our loss, the world's loss becomes even more painful."

A statement from The Elders said its members were "shocked and deeply saddened" by his death. "Kofi was a strong and inspiring presence to us all, and The Elders would not be where it is today without his leadership," said deputy chairman Gro Harlem Brundtland, adding that the group was resolved to continue to uphold Annan's values and legacy.

NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg tweeted that the world had lost one of its giants. "His warmth should never be mistaken for weakness," he said. "Annan showed that one can be a great humanitarian and a strong leader at the same time."

Carl Bildt, co-chairman of the European council on Foreign Relations and former Swedish Prime Minister, described Annan as "a man of courage, wisdom and friendship" and urged people to read his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize lecture.

Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo extended condolences on behalf of the entire nation and said the Ghanaian flag would fly at half staff across the country for a week, starting Monday. As the first person from sub-Saharan Africa to become UN Secretary-General, Annan "brought considerable renown to our country," he said.

Zimbabwe opposition leader Nelson Chamisa said he had met with Annan only a few days ago. "A rare breed of diplomat; soft spoken but unshakably firm. He had great love for world peace & democracy," he wrote on Twitter. "Go well son of Africa, Champion of the world!"

Former Kenyan Prime Minister and opposition leader Raila Odinga paid tribute to Annan's "tireless work in stabilizing the world and encouraging Africa to aspire to higher ideals of democracy, respect for human rights and sound governance."

Annan was remembered in Kenya as the man who "saved the country from collapse following the 2007-2008 post-election violence," Odinga said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Annan's efforts to build the United Nations' peacekeeping potential in a telegram to Guterres, cited by Russian state news agency TASS. "I was lucky to personally interact with Kofi Annan. I have been in genuine awe of his wisdom and courage, of his ability to make informed decisions even in the most difficult, critical situations," Putin said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he was extremely saddened by the loss of an "unwavering champion for peace, justice and rule of law" and a "dear old friend."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his sorrow, saying, "We will remember him as having been very active in the international arena and as someone who fought anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial."

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the world had lost "not only a great African diplomat and humanitarian but also a conscience keeper of international peace and security."

The director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, praised Annan as a "great leader."

Former US President Jimmy Carter, also a member of The Elders, said Annan "was a cherished personal friend and an inspiration to all who knew him."

What shaped his global thinking?

Annan was descended from tribal chiefs on both sides of his family. After studying in Ghana and at Macalester College in St. Paul, in the US state of Minnesota, he joined the United Nations in 1962 as a low-ranking officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva.

He thought he would stay only a few years but ended up spending almost his entire working life with the organization.

Then-UN peacekeeping chief Kofi Annan at a press conference in 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia.

While leading the UN's peacekeeping operations, Annan was involved in decisions that were potentially career-ending but which he managed to survive.

In 1994, the UN Security Council and others including Annan were accused by the UN field commander in Rwanda of ignoring his warnings, which resulted in the world's reluctance to send troops in and the estimated 800,000 deaths.

Speaking in 2004, Annan said: "I believed at the that time that I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more that I could have and should have done."

The next year, another moment came with the thousands of Muslims who were massacred in Srebrenica as Bosnian Serbs overran a UN "safe zone."

The Secretary-General at the time, Boutros Boutros Ghali, took the heat for UN failings in two of the darkest episodes of its history. Subsequent UN reports about the body's handling of the massacres were critical of Annan's leadership.

Champion of human rights

On taking the helm as Secretary-General in 1997, Annan became a high-profile figure who championed human rights and urged the United Nations to protect civilians if their own governments turned on them.

His first term was highly-rated but his second term, which coincided with the US invasion of Iraq, was not as smooth.

Annan would later call the assault illegal. "I think the worst moment of course was the Iraq war, which as an organization we couldn't stop -- and I really did everything I can to try to see if we can stop it," he said, speaking in 2006.

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Annan a "truly great" Secretary-General.

"It was an honor to work with him in his efforts to reform the UN, strengthen global health and peacekeeping, and reduce poverty. He made the fight against AIDS and the responsibility to protect civilians in conflict zones true priorities for the UN," they said in a statement.

"After he left office, he continued his leadership on poverty, environmental, and peace issues through his foundation." they wrote. "In every phase of his life, he held fast to his Ghanaian roots and set a powerful example of determined leadership while always treating others with respect and dignity."

In this 2003 file photo, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan greets US President George W Bush before the start of the 58th UN General Assembly.

Former US President George W. Bush, whose pursuit of the Iraq war often set him on a collision course with Annan, paid tribute to him as "a gentle man and a tireless leader of the United Nations. His voice of experience will be missed around the world."

Former US President Barack Obama said Annan "embodied the mission of the United Nations."

"His integrity, persistence, optimism, and sense of our common humanity always informed his outreach to the community of nations," Obama said.

In February 2012, the United Nations appointed Annan the UN and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria. Only six months later, he quit , citing increasing militarization in Syria and "the clear lack of unity" at the UN Security Council.

In a statement released by the United Nations, Guterres described Annan as both a personal mentor and an inspiration to all.

"He provided people everywhere with a space for dialogue, a place for problem-solving and a path to a better world. In these turbulent and trying times, he never stopped working to give life to the values of the United Nations Charter. His legacy will remain a true inspiration for all of us."
__label__world Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) Taliban insurgents are holding more than 20 bus passengers in Afghanistan's northern province of Kunduz, provincial spokesman Ismatullah Muradi told CNN.

The official said Taliban members stopped three buses traveling from Badakhshan and Takhar to the capital Kabul early Monday morning and abducted roughly 150 passengers.

Afghan security forces arrived at the scene and managed to free most of the passengers, including some women and children, but 21 people are still captive, Muradi said.

Zabiullah Mojahid, a Taliban spokesman, told CNN the insurgent group had received reports that there were Afghan security forces among the passengers and they stopped the buses to investigate.

He said his forces had not kidnapped the passengers but had taken them to a safe place near the highway to question them and will free them after the investigations are finished.
__label__world (CNN) Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has narrowly survived a leadership challenge, facing down a conservative uprising in his party's ranks over climate change policy.

But a second challenge could come by the end of the year, given the narrow result and policy tensions within the ruling Liberal Party.

"It's only half a dozen people or so who need to change to turn the result around," John Warhurst, emeritus professor of Australian Politics at the Australian National University, told CNN.

Turnbull has long advocated for action on climate change, and supports progressive social issues and an Australian Republic. But his policy positions have been viewed with suspicion and hostility by his party's vocal conservative faction, who want greater investment in coal and cuts to immigration.

Turnbull threw all leadership positions in the Liberal Party open early Tuesday, inviting challengers to nominate themselves for party leader.

__label__world Kerala, India (CNN) Dharamvir Singh is the leader of a team of six men tackling their latest tough assignment in the flood-ravaged southern Indian state of Kerala.

Their mission is to safely evacuate stranded residents and to deliver supplies to desperate flood victims who have been without food and clean water for days.

Members of the Indian government's National Disaster Response Force are working to reach isolated pockets of people after deadly flash floods devastated the region's idyllic countryside.

Singh holds the rope of an inflatable orange dinghy as the team makes its way through a stew of river water and sewage that's now become a cesspool of infection.

His team draws on years of training as they navigate the dinghy through narrow streets that are filled with up to six feet of filthy water.

"Rescuers have to become friends with water. Otherwise they can't rescue anyone successfully," said Singh.

In the small town of Peringara, in the Thiruvalla district, water flooded hundreds of houses with no warning Wednesday. Banana trees are split down the middle and their leaves float forlornly in the water, walls have crumbled and cars filled with water are sitting abandoned in the streets.

Ground floors flooded in an hour

"In the morning water started coming in. The water was [up to] our necks. We could not even collect our belongings," said Girija, who goes only by her first name.

A house is partially submerged in flood waters in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sunday, August 19.

In one hour, water filled up the ground floor of most houses in the town. People scrambled to get onto the first floor, if they had one or the roof. No one in the town remembers a flood like this.

By Thursday, locals began navigating through the water looking for people who may need to be evacuated.

Prashant M. built a makeshift raft out of the trunk of banana trees lashed together with ropes. Volunteers pulled the raft along carrying big steel or plastic water tubs. Each could hold two or three people.

"We have a big pot. They sit in it and on the raft and as we wade through the water, we pull them behind us with ropes," said Prashant.

Local residents carry a young boy to safety in a steel tub that is used to cook food.

By the next day, the NDRF team had arrived in the town. Their first assignment -- locate an elderly man locals said was in the middle of nowhere and deliver an oxygen tank. It was 2:30 a.m.

"He was on his last tank and running out of oxygen. We had to reach him somehow," said Singh.

It took the team hours -- but they reached him in in time.

Inflatable craft the only option

Dozens of teams like Singh's have been deployed across the state over the last few days. In areas that are inaccessible by foot or by air, inflatable dinghies are the only option.

An Indian policeman, left, and a volunteer carry essential supplies for stranded people in a flooded area in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sunday, August 19.

The men locate a safe spot and begin inflating the small boats. They are equipped with a motor that works only if there is more than four feet water. For water below that level, the men leap out of the dinghy, grab ropes and start pulling it along.

Kerala is a state filled with rivers. Usually, those rivers provide it with a natural beauty that inspires millions of tourists to visit the land, commonly known as, "God's own country."

Today, those same rivers have ruined hundreds of thousands of homes and claimed more than 230 lives in less than two weeks.

The swollen waters have spilled out into fields and playgrounds. It is hard to differentiate where the roads end and the rivers begin, except when the men shout that the water is deep and they slip and slide into the dinghies, with palpable relief on their faces and start the motor. This gives them a few minutes of respite before the dinghy scrapes against a speed bump or the road and the laborious process begins all over again.

Singh and his team have been navigating through the waters and take the help of locals who point out the best way forward -- a way where there are no fallen trees, no barbed wire guarding the fields and most importantly, no strong currents.

At one point, the tiny boat swings madly as water rushes out of the river and is sucked into a low-lying street on the other side. Singh throws a foot at the wall, trying to stabilize the boat and flips over into the water. His men shout and he emerges, soaking wet but still issues instructions as he draws deep breaths.

Mission worth separation from family

It is a hard job that requires physical strength and perseverance, something these men do not lack. Working through floods across India over the past seven years, Singh loves being on duty. He considers himself lucky.

An Indian air-force helicopter on rescue mission flies through a flooded area in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala, India, Sunday, August 19.

Every year, he operates in flood-hit areas for a few weeks, separated from his wife and two children. His mission makes it worth it, he said. Saving lives is not the usual government desk job, he added with a smile.

The team reaches a local health center located deep inside the town. More than 100 people have sought refuge there with a few belongings. The smell of disinfectant, stale water and disease lies heavy in the air.

Women prepare lunch at a temporary relief camp set up in a local health center in Kerala.

There is no bathroom, there is no clean drinking water or sanitary pads for women. A group of women dressed in nighties stand and cook rice soup for everyone.

The team carries six people in need of medical help down a flight of stairs and gently place them in the dinghy. Life jackets are tightened, the people are reassured that they are safe and going to a better place. And then the motor whirs into life and the dinghy takes off.

Singh directs his men to return to their original location -- where a shipment of relief material is waiting and the team will make their way back into the flooded town for a third time in 36 hours. On shift for the past ten hours, none of them knows when they will get to sleep next.
__label__world (CNN) Australian advocates and opposition politicians are campaigning to free 119 children from forced detention on a tiny Pacific Island, amid warnings that the health of several young refugees is quickly deteriorating.

One 12-year-old boy, detained on Nauru under the Australian government's strict border policies, is seriously ill after refusing to eat for at least two weeks and needs to be transferred to the mainland for treatment, doctors say.

Doctors for Refugees President Barri Phatarfod told CNN the 12-year-old boy was one of several young children on Nauru whose health was progressively deteriorating.

"We can only assume (he has) depression because of his progressive withdrawal from different aspects of life ... We know he refuses to eat and refuses to drink," Phatarfod said.

There are 119 children still living on Nauru after being transferred there under Australia's immigration policy, which bans asylum seekers who arrive by boat from being settled on the mainland.

__label__world (CNN) Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has bowed to pressure from within his own party to drop plans to include carbon emission reduction targets in the government's new energy policy.

The decision to renege on a key part of the government's National Energy Guarantee (NEG) has created a political furor and raised questions about Turnbull's future as leader of the Liberal Party -- and the country.

Turnbull had proposed reducing carbon emissions by 26%, from 2005 levels, by 2030 as part of the NEG, in line with the Paris climate agreement.

However, facing backlash from his Coalition government and the threat of a leadership challenge, Turnbull tried to appease critics Friday by proposing setting emissions reduction targets by regulation instead of legislation.

He took it a step further on Monday, announcing at a press conference that the targets would be scrapped entirely from the the NEG.

Rescue operations started immediately after a small stream near the village of Civita overflowed at 5:30 p.m. local time, he said.

The operations are still underway in the flooded canyon area, as at least three more people remain missing. So far, 23 people have been rescued.

Rescue teams work at the gorge Monday in Pollino National Park.

More than a hundred emergency rescuers are searching for survivors, the spokesman said, adding that the number of people missing is unknown.

__label__world Rome (CNN) Pope Francis has acknowledged "with shame and repentance" the Catholic Church's failure to act over sexual abuse by clerics against minors going back decades, writing "we showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them."

In an unusually blunt letter released by the Vatican on Monday, the Pope wrote, "I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons.

"Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient. Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated."

His letter comes in the wake of a Pennsylvania grand jury report that detailed decades of sexual abuses by priests and cover-ups by bishops.

Gruesome accounts of abuse

The report said internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania -- some held in a secret archive to which only the bishop had a key -- show that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims.

The lengthy catalog of clergy sexual abuses in the report makes for difficult reading. As the grand jurors noted, priests and other Catholic leaders targeted boys, girls and teens.

Some victims were plied with alcohol and groped or molested, the report says. Others were orally, vaginally or anally raped, according to the grand jurors.

Francis' conversations with victims over the years shaped the letter, which points out the need for urgent accountability both for those who committed the abuse and for those who covered it up -- bishops, in many cases, said Vatican spokesman Greg Burke.

"This is about Ireland, this is about the United States and this is about Chile -- but not only. Pope Francis has written to the people of God and that means everyone," Burke said in an audio statement. "It's significant that the Pope calls abuse a crime, not only a sin, and that he asks for forgiveness but he acknowledges that no effort to repair the damage done will ever be sufficient for victims and survivors."

Pope Francis's letter directly referred to the Pennsylvania report, which "detailed the experiences of at least 1,000 survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately 70 years."

"Even though it can be said that most of these cases belong to the past, nonetheless as time goes on we have come to know the pain of many of the victims. We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death; these wounds never go away," the Pope wrote.

"The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced. But their outcry was more powerful than all the measures meant to silence it, or sought even to resolve it by decisions that increased its gravity by falling into complicity."

Looking ahead, the pontiff said the church was working on a "zero tolerance" policy on abuse and coverups. He added, "If, in the past, the response was one of omission, today we want solidarity, in the deepest and most challenging sense, to become our way of forging present and future history."

Bishopaccountability.org, a nonprofit advocacy group that tracks church abuse cases, says lawsuits have forced religious orders and dioceses to pay $3 billion in settlements.

Crucial test for Francis' papacy

The Pope has been under increasing pressure to comment on the nearly 900-page report amid a rapidly escalating sexual abuse crisis that has spread across several continents -- from Australia to Latin America.

While the Vatican finally broke its silence on the report by releasing a damning statement on Thursday, Pope Francis notably made no mention of it during his public sermon in Rome on Sunday.

The crisis presents a crucial test for Francis' papacy, which has stumbled badly at times to address sexual abuse among clergy.

As Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, the Pope's top adviser on sexual abuse, said in a statement last week, "The clock is ticking for all of us in Church leadership."

"Catholics have lost patience with us and civil society has lost confidence in us," he added.

Juan Carlos Cruz, who experienced abuse in Chile and now lives in Philadelphia, said that while the abuse report is heartbreaking, he was encouraged by a change in vocabulary coming from the Pope and out of the Vatican.

"There's new language," said Cruz, who spent a week in May talking to Francis about sex abuse. "They talk about crimes. They talk about a culture of death. They talk about a culture of abuse and cover-up. Before, they were omissions, sins, which is terrible."

Francis' letter, he said, "talks about going to local justice, how bishops don't turn the perpetrators (over) to local justice because they're not obligated to do so, and that is a horrible crime."

At the same time, Cruz is disheartened by what he said was the church's fight against measures to bring clergy to justice, he said. He cited specifically lobbying efforts to derail Pennsylvania state Rep. Mark Rozzi's proposal to suspend the statute of limitations for victims of child sex abuse.

"They have to lobby to help survivors, not to fight them," he said.

This weekend, the Pope will travel to Ireland, which also suffered a sex abuse scandal in 2009. Pope Francis is expected to meet with victims during his visit.

All eyes will also be on whether the Pope publicly addresses the Pennsylvania report.
__label__world Idlib, Syria (CNN) Locals in the village of Urem Kubra gesture to a man standing surrounded by rubble.

"He can't talk much. He's in shock," the village elder said, referring to 33-year-old Ibrahim Abu Naif.

On the wreckage of what used to be his house, Ibrahim set aside a neat pile of children's clothing he had dug out of the debris. He lifted a blue jacket with "sports" emblazoned on the back, and brought it to his face, taking in a whiff as he did so.

"This, this was Nayef's. He's gone," Ibrahim said of his 3-year-old son.

He pulled out more clothing: a red and white knit cardigan, a pair of tights with a Christmas pattern and a striped t-shirt. The clothes belonged to four of his children who were killed in last week's airstrikes.

He has one surviving child.

"Hatice. Hatice is alive and living at her grandparents. She has a head wound," Ibrahim told CNN, holding one of her pink sweaters.

When war planes struck Urem Kubra, a rebel-held village just outside Idlib province on Friday night, most of the women in the village were home with children, preparing dinner. The planes hovered in the air for around 10 minutes before the first strikes, witnesses said. The jets then swung back around, hitting the town two more times. More than 40 people were killed in 30 minutes, the majority of them women and children.

Ibrahim Dervish used to play right outside the ice cream shop with his friends who were killed in the airstrike. The shopkeeper would sometimes give them free ice cream. Ibrahim's favorite is mixed cherry and vanilla in a cone.

Ten-year-old Ibrahim Dervish wandered aimlessly around the Urem Kubra town square, a few meters from the ice cream shop where he and his friends used to play.

"I miss Mohammad Hasan, Mays and Omar," he said, listing his friends' names. They were all killed in the strike.

The ice cream shop was reduced to a heap of rubble. Dervish said he used to get vanilla and cherry flavored ice cream in a cone for 100 Syrian pounds ($1). The shop owner, he said, often gave them freebies.

"I'm sad that we don't have the shop anymore and that my friends are dead," Dervish said.

It is a scene that has played out across Syria for more than seven years. Idlib is one of several de-escalation zones agreed on by some of the war's main international actors, Russia, Turkey and Iran. Yet it has been repeatedly bombed, with airstrikes target alleged rebel posts, medical facilities and residential neighborhoods.

Last rebel stronghold

The Syrian government swept through rebel-held areas over the past year. Many residents and fighters from across Syria were transferred to Idlib and the northern countrysides of nearby provinces as part of opposition agreements with the government. As a result, the population of the northwestern province has doubled since the start of the war, and it is a bastion of Syria's opposition fighters.

But this is the last rebel stronghold, and the fighters and residents here have nowhere else to go.

There are also international interests regarding Idlib. Turkey is heavily involved here and insists it will protect the area against a government incursion. Still, the Russian-backed Syrian government has trained its sights on the province and seems intent on crushing the rebels. Fighting is incessant, and Idlib's ultimate fate is unknown.

Abdulkadir Halit opened a barber shop in the Rahme Cluster after his shop in Hama was destroyed in airstrikes. He cuts about six heads of hair per day at a cost of 200 Syrian pounds ($2).

United Nations estimates put the population here at more than 3 million. Most live in camps along the border with Turkey, which already has taken in 3.5 million Syrian refugees since the start of the war. But the Turkish border is now effectively closed, with Ankara choosing to prevent another wave of refugees from crossing by building a border wall and bolstering aid to Idlib.

"We have sent in a lot of humanitarian aid, set up military observation points and have taken on diplomatic efforts to sustain this area," said a senior Turkish official, who asked not to be named.

An assault on Idlib is a red line for Turkey. Negotiations are ostensibly under way between Russia, Iran and Turkey. But agreements are hard to come by in Syria. It plays host to many regional, local and international actors, each with its own shifting agendas.

Government leaflets

Earlier this month, Syrian government planes dropped leaflets on the city of Jisr Al Shugur in Idlib.

"Your cooperation with the Syrian Arab Army will get rid of the armed terrorists among you and will keep you and your families safe," the leaflet read.

For those who'd previously fled other opposition areas, this is an ominous sign. One activist, who was relocated to Idlib from Eastern Ghouta following a brutal government incursion there, said the leaflets were identical to ones he saw in Eastern Ghouta before a Russian and Syrian government assault overran the rebels there.

"I'm afraid the same thing will happen in Idlib," he told CNN, asking for his name not to be quoted. People in Idlib know the violence is closing in on them, but no one sees an escape route.

Halime Dervish was cooking in her kitchen when the airstrikes took place. Her two kids were wounded. They managed to get out of the house through a hole in a wall created by the blast.

An assault on Idlib would mean high casualties. The province is more tightly packed and more densely populated than other areas in the country.

Along the Turkish border, the white tents of the refugee camps have grayed with time. As residents build up concrete block walls and cement floors, the camps have taken on an air of permanence and transformed into sprawling slums. Shops selling wedding dresses, restaurants, and pharmacies have popped up.

For now, an uneasy calm has taken over.

Some of the first internally displaced people to move to Idlib's tent cities live in a makeshift district called the Rahme Cluster.

Hishan Hadar, 48, originally from the adjacent Hama, has been here for five years.

"This area started out as tents, but then over time people managed to build it up," he said.

He said the possibility of a Syrian regime operation leaves people in Idlib only one choice. "We have nothing to do but to defend. Either we die with honor, or we die with honor -- there is no other choice," he told CNN.

Others are even more resigned.

"There is no hope," says Sara Shahin who, along with her five children, has been in Rahme for six years. Her children may never see their native Kafra Buda in the countryside of the northeastern province of Hama. Her eldest son hopes to be married soon.

"He might marry here... my kids will grow up here... I have a feeling we will be here till we die," she said.

Vaciha Turki-Al Omar, 30, has been in Idlib for seven months. She stands on the hill overlooking the sprawling refugee camp with her kids. "We can try to fight, but the kids are our weakness so we must run away," she says.

Around the corner, in what has been transformed into the town's main street, Abdulkadir Halit, 25, has opened a barber shop after airstrikes destroyed his old shop in his native town of Hama.

"I would go back tomorrow if I could, and God willing, maybe I will," he told CNN.

A few doors down, smoke from a tiny restaurant wafts into the street. Hasan Ali is turning skewers of chicken and tomatoes over slow-burning coal. The 38-year-old cook says he has no sense of what will become of him and his family, but the thought of never returning to his hometown in Hama is unfathomable.

"Pain. That's what we feel. We left our home. What can we feel but pain?" he said while fanning the grill.

On the hills above the Rahme Cluster, children fly kites, old men reflect in a somber silence, and others revel in the open space. Vaciha Turki-Al Omar comes to the edge of a cliff and points out roughly where her tent is. Since the beginning of the war, this mother of eight has lost too many family members and loved ones to count.

The war brought with it a relentless move northward.

"We left because of airstrikes. Our home is gone, destroyed," she said. "This place is our last hope."

(CNN) Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's vocal support of the #MeToo movement demonstrates her belief in the continued fight for equality now being led by younger generations, Clara Spera, the granddaughter of the judge, told CNN.

My grandmother "understands that there are generational shifts when it comes to seeking certain rights and equality," Spera told Poppy Harlow and Jeffrey Toobin in the premiere episode of CNN's new podcast series, "RBG: Beyond Notorious," which was released Monday.

"What she may have been fighting [against] in the seventies -- actual black and white discrimination written into laws on paper -- while there may be less of that type of gender-based discrimination now, there are perhaps similarly insidious types of discrimination that appear in different ways," Spera told Harlow and Toobin, adding she believes that progress won in social movements must be codified in law to have a lasting impact.

The podcast series tells the story of the life and times of Ginsburg. The fifth episode revisits the 1970s, when Ginsburg worked as an attorney and the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project.

At that time, she took on clients who had experienced gender-based discrimination, arguing six such cases before the Supreme Court.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Making his first visit to the US since taking office, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to deliver a speech Tuesday that will call on the European Union "to ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive, and that we truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the US."

Hunt, who assumed the role of UK foreign secretary last month following the resignation of Boris Johnson, will focus his remarks on the global response to Russia's "malign behavior," which "undermines the international order that keeps us safe," according to excerpts of the speech obtained by CNN.

"Of course we must engage with Moscow, but we must also be blunt: Russia's foreign policy under President Putin has made the world a more dangerous place," Hunt will say at the US Institute of Peace in Washington.

"And today the United Kingdom asks its allies to go further by calling on the European Union to ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive, and that we truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the US. That means calling out and responding to transgressions with one voice whenever and wherever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the fate of Crimea," an excerpt of the speech says.

Additionally, Hunt is expected to argue "that the values underpinning the international rules-based system that has kept us safe for decades are under threat."

__label__world (CNN) Representatives of the Taliban will take part in talks in Moscow next month on the future of Afghanistan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday.

"The initial response is positive - they plan to take part in this meeting. I hope it will be productive," he told reporters in the southern Russian city of Sochi.

Moscow has taken an increasingly active role in efforts to persuade the Taliban to enter into a political settlement with the US-backed Afghan government, with which it has been in a lengthy conflict with.

Last week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered a month long ceasefire with the Taliban , as officials in Kabul and Washington push for an end to the war which has stretched on since the US invasion in 2001.

"We remain ready to support, facilitate, and participate in direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban. There are no obstacles to talks. It is time for peace," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said after Ghani's comments.

Three shots were fired from a nearby ridge, one of which landed in the water just meters from one of the surfers, a 14-year-old boy, local media reported.

The surfers -- two adults and the teenage boy -- were riding waves at Te Maika off the Taharoa coast, near the entrance to Kawhia Harbour, last Thursday.

The shots were fired at them from two individuals onshore, the police report said. Their identity is currently unknown, Kawhia Police Senior Constable Jonathan Maoate said in a written statement.

__label__world (CNN) Russia will stage its largest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union next month, the country's Defense Ministry said Monday.

Thousands of troops from China and Mongolia are expected to join in the exercises in Siberia, dubbed Vostok 2018, according to statements from the Russian and Chinese defense ministries.

The games will have an "unprecedented scale both in territory and number of troops involved," supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian armed forces, Gen. Sergi Shoigu, said in a statement.

Shoigu said it would be the "largest event since the Zapad-81 maneuvers," which involved as many as 150,000 troops, according to CIA documents.

Those exercises saw the Soviet Union test new weapons, including intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Videos from the Zapad-81 games show huge formations of tanks and artillery as well as jet aircraft making mock attacks.
__label__world (CNN) A 12-year-old boy detained on Nauru under the Australian government's strict border policies has been transferred to the mainland for treatment, according to a spokesman for a refugee advocacy group.

The boy, accompanied by his mother, stepfather and sister, has left the island for Australia by air ambulance, according to Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition

He is seriously ill after refusing to eat for at least two weeks, necessitating his evacuation, according to medical professionals.

Doctors for Refugees President Barri Phatarfod told CNN that the boy was one of several young children on Nauru whose health was progressively deteriorating.

"We can only assume (he has) depression because of his progressive withdrawal from different aspects of life ... We know he refuses to eat and refuses to drink," Phatarfod said.

There are 119 children still living on Nauru after being transferred there under Australia's immigration policy, which bans asylum seekers who arrive by boat from being settled on the mainland.

The Australian government insists the children are no longer in detention, but they and their parents are not allowed to leave. The Australian Border Force was contacted by CNN for comment but did not respond.

'Acts of self-harm and depression'

The Australian government started moving hundreds of asylum seekers and refugees, including children, to Nauru after reopening its detention center in 2012. Since then there have been regular reports of physical and psychological damage suffered by the new arrivals.

A 2016 UN report found many cases of "attempted suicide, self-immolation, acts of self-harm and depression" among children detained on Nauru.

According to Phatarfod, the only way for someone to be transferred from Nauru to Australia for medical treatment is to be at risk of imminent death.

She told CNN a number of children on Nauru were regressing developmentally, showing less ability at their current age than a few years ago.

'Stop playing politics'

Using the hashtag #KidsOffNauru , more than 30 non-government organizations in Australia have started a petition calling for the government to allow the refugee children to leave the island.

"(This) is a test of the courage of our political leaders to resolve this situation. If they fail this test, we will not drop the baton in championing these children to be put in a situation where they can grow up as normal, healthy children," said World Vision Chief Executive Claire Rogers.

George, one of the child refugees on the island, was born in Nauru -- the family have been on the island for 5 years.

Some members of the Australian Parliament have spoken out in an attempt to gain help for the detainees on Nauru.

Speaking in the House of Representatives on August 13, Independent politician Andrew Wilkie called on the government in a speech to "stop playing politics with people's lives," listing a dozen cases of detainees in severe need of medical treatment.

"A 12-year-old boy who has overdosed twice in the past fortnight, an 11-year-old girl who is suicidal, an eight-year-old boy with autism in need of substantial support, a 27-year-old woman (who) was sexually assaulted on Nauru and is so afraid to leave her accommodation she has felt forced to urinate in a bucket," he said.

Demands for release

The 30 charities came together on Monday to demand the government release the children by Universal Children's Day, November 20.

As part of their campaign, they released images of three children who are living on the tiny island, including two-year-old Roze who has spent her entire life there.

"There are children here suffering. We don't know what our future holds. Our children are like any other little children around the world -- but they are not allowed to be free," their parents said in a statement

Two-year-old refugee Roze has spent her entire life on the island.

World Vision's Rogers told CNN the young people marooned on Nauru had less hope than children she'd seen in refugee camps around the world.

"I never thought I'd have to fight this in my own country, but the things that are going on Nauru have just caught my heart," she said.

So far there has been no indication the Australian Government will listen to the latest plea for the refugees, but Rogers said they will keep trying no matter what.

"No one's saying this isn't a complex problem, but locking up children is not the solution," she said.
__label__world (CNN) A landslide of rubbish from a vast open-air landfill site just outside of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, killed more than 110 people last year.

This weekend, the Ethiopian government inaugurated a $120 million waste-to-energy plant, right next to the garbage dump, in an attempt to curb the city's mounting waste problem.

The plant -- called Reppie -- is now operational and able to harvest energy from 1.4 million kilograms of waste each day.

This will produce enough electricity to power an estimated 30% of Addis Ababa's households, according to the company responsible for the project, Cambridge Industries

"One of the exciting things for us about the Reppie facility in Addis is that it's the first of its kind in Africa," Samuel Alemayehu, Managing Director for Africa of Cambridge Industries, tells CNN.

__label__world (CNN) Hardline Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini is refusing to give permission to an Italian Coast Guard ship to disembark 177 people it rescued off the island of Lampedusa last week.

Migrants aboard the Ubaldo Diciotti, which docked in Catania, Sicily, after being forced to remain at sea for five days, will not be allowed off the ship until Italy receives assurances they will be relocated elsewhere in Europe, Salvini said.

The Coast Guard ship picked up 190 migrants on August 15 from an overcrowded boat 17 miles off Lampedusa after they were refused entry to Malta.

Transport Minister Danio Toninelli tweeted on Saturday, "Diciotti shows that Italy never pulls back when it comes to saving human lives. Malta's behavior is once again unspeakable/deplorable and deserving of sanctions."

Thirteen of them were taken to Lampedusa because of serious medical conditions, Coast Guard Lt. Floriana Segreto told CNN, but the remaining 177 were left in international waters. The majority of migrants are from Eritrea, with some people from Bangladesh, Syria and Egypt, the Coast Guard said.

__label__world (CNN) A former politician who rose to prominence a decade ago after revealing on national television that he was abused in a Catholic-run school in Ireland has said that Pope Francis has a lot to answer for when he arrives in Dublin this weekend.

Victims of clerical abuse around the world are watching closely as the Pope visits Ireland this weekend, in the wake of a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing decades of sexual abuses by priests and cover-ups by bishops.

"I will never forgive the church for what they've done to me. I won't," Michael O'Brien, an 85-year-old former mayor from Clonmel, County Tipperary, told CNN on Tuesday. He added that the Pope's letter acknowledging the church's failure to act over abuse in the wake of the Pennsylvania report was not enough.

"This apology is no good. There must be action. Young boys and young girls will still be abused by priests," O'Brien said. "We're fed up with all this. We want closure. We want it to stop."

This is being shares ahead of the pope's visit to Ireland, had me in tears https://t.co/0mTU8g6hIQ pic.twitter.com/LAak4UaVZ5

Videos of his appearance on RTÉ's Questions and Answers show in 2009 -- in which O'Brien described, in graphic detail, the abuse he faced as a child at a Catholic-run industrial school -- have gone viral on social media ahead of the Pope's visit this week.

Despite having been in politics for much of his adult life up to that point, it was the first time O'Brien, who was in the live audience for the show, had spoken about the abuse publicly.

He also lambasted the then-Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey -- a member of his own political party -- who was on the program to answer questions following the release of the 2009 Ryan Report, which found there had been endemic abuse and neglect in Catholic-run institutions in Ireland between the 1930s and the 1970s.

"I got raped of a Saturday, got a merciful beating after it and he then came along the following morning and put Holy Communion in my mouth. You don't know what happened there," O'Brien told Dempsey.

O'Brien railed against the government, telling Dempsey he didn't have "the foggiest" understanding of the pain felt by victims of abuse, which was clear from how O'Brien said he and others had been treated by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.

He then recalled attempting to take his own life after five days of questioning by the commission. Turning to his wife, who was sitting next to him in the studio audience, he said: "That woman will tell you how many times I jump out of bed at night with the sweat pumping out of me because I see these fellows at the end of the bed with their fingers pulling me into the room to rape me."

O'Brien also turned to a politician from another party -- Leo Varadkar, who is now Ireland's Prime Minister -- and said: "Can I speak to you and ask your leader to stop making a political football out of this. You hurt us when you do that. You tear the shreds from inside our body. For God's sake, try and give us some peace, try and give us some peace, and not continue hurting us."

O'Brien's emotional recounting of his abuse echoed the shock Ireland was feeling at the time, according to The Irish Times' religious affairs correspondent Patsy McGarry, who said that even in 2009, speaking out about abuse was still rare.

"Michael O'Brien is a man who was in local politics, a member of one of our major political parties and participated in public life without ever speaking about his abuse," McGarry told CNN. "I can understand why he wouldn't want to talk about it publicly, because nobody spoke about it publicly then."

Now, nine years after the report was released, O'Brien says not much has changed.

"As far as I'm concerned, very little has been done since the 2009 report," O'Brien told CNN in a phone conversation Tuesday.

While Ireland has pledged €1.5 billion to survivors through a financial redress scheme, O'Brien said that compensation is not enough -- abuse must be eradicated and he called on the Pope to take action.

As a former politician O'Brien said he understood that Pope Francis was coming to Ireland as a head of state, and respected it, but demanded change.

"He must talk to us and tell us what he's going to do about the rape of children that's been done by priests of the Catholic Church today. He must stop it and tell me why did you allow it to happen at all," O'Brien said. "Why should people who commit such a heinous crime to be allowed to go free?"

"I don't see anything at the end of the tunnel. Until I hear something else from the Pope, I won't believe it," he added.

The Vatican confirmed on Tuesday that the Pope will meet privately with abuse survivors during his visit to Ireland, after the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, had drawn ire earlier this month for saying that "time was very tight" for the Pope to meet survivors on his two-day visit.

O'Brien said he rang the Archbishop to ask him who was representing survivors of institutional abuse when the Pope visits, but said he still hadn't received an answer.

"They don't want to use the word 'institutional' abuse because it was the biggest scandal that ever happened to the Catholic Church in Ireland. They're hoping it will die away by not mentioning the words," O'Brien said.

For his part, O'Brien said he was surprised by the reaction that the country had to his appearance on RTÉ in 2009, and recalled coming home to a group of 15 journalists outside his front gate in Clonmel. He was unaware that the video had been recirculating in recent months on Facebook, which he is not on, but said he was heartened by the support.

Test flights of the jet, dubbed the Kowsar, took place Tuesday on the eve of the National Day of the Defense Industry, according to semi-official Mehr News Agency . It was unclear whether the jet's first public display flight has yet taken place.

The Kowsar can be used for "short aerial support missions" and is equipped with systems that "promote precision targeting," according to state media.

__label__world Jerusalem (CNN) Israel has relaxed the country's restrictions on gun licenses, in a move that could make up to 500,000 more civilians eligible to carry firearms, provided they have a certain amount of military or security training.

The new regulations allow veterans of Israel's infantry units to more easily obtain licenses, as well as allowing officers and commanders who have completed their reserve duty to keep their weapons. The regulations also allow emergency responders and former police officers to obtain gun licenses more easily.

The change could potentially quadruple the number of civilians in Israel who have gun permits. Roughly 145,000 civilians currently have gun permits, according to Israel's ministry of public security.

The changes went into effect Tuesday, with Israeli minister of public security Gilad Erdan saying more armed civilians increases the chances of stopping attacks and preventing injuries.

"Trained citizens who hold weapons in the public sphere contribute to the feeling of security," Erdan said in a statement announcing the new regulations. "They are an important line of defense against 'lone wolf' actions and are used in a sense as a temporary force multiplier, thereby strengthening public safety."

__label__politics (CNN) Two courtroom decisions within minutes of each other, each with eight convictions, against President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and campaign chairman engulfed Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where Republicans downplayed the connection of both cases to the White House while Democrats seized on the President's potential role and raised the prospect that he could have broken the law, too.

The guilty plea from Trump's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen and the guilty verdicts against Paul Manafort once again scrambled the narrative for the President and special counsel Robert Mueller, prompting dueling reactions from senators peppered with questions about the latest developments.

"If Manafort and Cohen did things that (they) shouldn't have done, which it sounds like they did, I think they ought to be held responsible for it but I don't see any of this having anything to do with the President and Russia," Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters. "My expectation is that Mr. Mueller knows the lay of the land. The fact that he interviewed Don McGahn for 30 hours with the President's approval strikes me as having nothing to hide when it comes to the Russia investigation. So I hope this ends up concluding sooner rather than later and doesn't continue to be an issue in another election."

Democrats argued the news had ramifications for the special counsel's ongoing Russia investigation.

"If, as Michael Cohen testified in his guilty plea, his felonies were committed at the direction of ‪@realDonaldTrump, then the POTUS would be part of a federal crime - the only thing limiting DOJ from prosecuting being an OLC ruling saying a sitting president cannot be indicted," Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Republican Senate hopeful Kelli Ward explained her decision to invite onto her bus tour a far-right commentator who promoted the infamous "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory as a necessary "hook" to garner attention for her campaign.

Mike Cernovich is known for his role peddling far-right conspiracy theories, including "Pizzagate," which connected Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta to a supposed pedophilia ring in a Washington, DC, pizza restaurant. The incident came to a head in December 2016 when a man fired an AR-15 inside the restaurant, saying he was attempting to find and rescue child sex slaves he believed were being held there. No one was injured.

When pressed on Cernovich's past statements in an interview with NBC News that was posted online Monday night, Ward said, "Attaching those things to me is ridiculous."

"We need to have a hook to get you guys interested in seeing the bus tour, and so, you know, just having a great candidate isn't always enough for the media, sadly. So you need someone to spin things up and you guys have bitten," Ward added.

She continued, "We invited a lot of people on the bus tour who support building the wall, border security and the America First agenda. We've got national politicians and figures, we've got local that are coming as well. I don't know why you guys are focusing on Cernovich."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) The League of Conservation Voters, an organization that has spent the last two years fighting President Donald Trump's environmental agenda, plans to spend over $15 million in helping Democrats' effort to take back the House in 2018, according to a memo from the group's top political operative.

The planned spending through the group's political action committee, reported first by CNN, represents the largest commitment the group has ever made on House races. It will focus on competitive districts seen both as winnable by Democratic leaders and open to a pro-environmental message by the group.

The spending is different from most outside group involvement in the 2018 midterm elections: While Democrats have been pouring money into competitive House races as a way to deliver a powerful message to Trump in November, group operatives tell CNN their messaging will focus primarily on hyper-local environmental issues that have been exacerbated by the President as a way to show environmental messaging still resonates with a host of voters, including suburbanites, Republican-leaning women and older Latino voters.

"This is both -- the most anti-environmental President in history; it is also the most anti-environmental Congress in history," said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, faulting Republicans for actions on energy regulations, steps taken to cut back on public lands and the easing of rules on pollution.

Initially the group will target a mix of 12 districts, broken up into swing races in California, races where incumbent Republicans are vulnerable and districts Trump won in 2016.

__label__politics (CNN) Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter and his wife, Margaret, routinely -- and illegally -- used campaign funds to pay personal bills big and small, from luxury vacations to kids' school lunches and delinquent family dentistry bills, according to a stinging 47-page indictment unsealed Tuesday.

The charges of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign finance violations and conspiracy were the culmination of a Department of Justice investigation that has stretched for more than a year, during which the Republican congressman from California has maintained his innocence.

The detailed indictment portrays the Hunters as living well beyond their means and said they "knowingly conspired with each other" to convert campaign funds to personal use.

Federal prosecutors contend that the Hunters repeatedly misrepresented what their expenses were for -- in one instance buying personal clothing at a golf course so that the purchase "could be falsely reported to the treasurer as 'balls for the wounded warriors,'" the indictment says.

The indictment also charges that Duncan Hunter facilitated the "theft of campaign funds" by directing his treasurer to obtain a campaign credit card for his wife at a time when she had no formal role.

The congressman then insisted that his wife be named as his paid campaign manager -- over the objections of his treasurer -- because, according to the document, he said the family needed "the extra money that would come from her salary."

Prosecutors said Hunter also allowed the alleged theft to take place by "ignoring his campaign staff's multiple warnings about Margaret Hunter's improper use of campaign funds." He lashed out at aides, the indictment says, by accusing them of disloyalty and "trying to create some kind of paper trail on me."

The indictment makes it clear that the Hunters were in dire financial straits and could not have supported their lifestyle without the use of those campaign funds.

The Hunters overdrew their personal bank accounts more 1,100 times in a seven-year period, according to the indictment from the US Attorney's Office in San Diego, resulting in $37,761 in "overdraft" and "insufficient funds" bank fees.

"By virtue of these delinquencies -- as well as notifications of outstanding debts and overdue payments from their children's school, their family dentist, and other creditors -- the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could only be made by using campaign funds," the indictment says.

The Justice Department said the Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in federal court in San Diego.

A spokesperson for Duncan Hunter said the congressman believes the indictment against him and his wife is "purely politically motivated."

Hunter's team asked DOJ to recuse two prosecutors who they say attended a Clinton campaign event in La Jolla. According to letters to DOJ released by Hunter's team, US Attorney Adam Braverman determined recusal was not necessary.

A letter to US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein accuses DOJ of a truncated process and timing that will "hand" Democrats a victory in Hunter's Republican district.

Multiple sources familiar with the case tell CNN that the decision to indict was made by Braverman, who was appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year. Assistant US attorneys act at Braverman's direction and there's no connection between this case and the 2016 presidential election.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the US attorney's office said, "The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the Department of Justice in Washington, DC reviewed and rejected Mr. Hunter's complaints. The prosecutors attended the event at the invitation of the Secret Service. The Secret Service, for many years, has routinely invited prosecutors to attend events involving their protectees in support of the Service's law enforcement mission."

Republican Party leaders had long worried that with a potential indictment looming, Hunter's traditionally safe district, which makes up much of eastern San Diego County, could be at risk of Democratic takeover in November's midterm election.

Senior White House officials were aware of the impending announcement and bracing for the Hunter news to join a slew of bad news stories that have hit the White House all at once, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Hunter was a founding member of the "Trump Caucus" in the House during the 2016 campaign, and alongside Rep. Chris Collins, was the first of two sitting congressmen to endorse Trump for President back in February 2016. Collins was indicted earlier this month on insider trading charges.

In a statement on Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the charges against Duncan "deeply serious" and said he will be removed from his committee assignments "pending the resolution of this matter."

Rep. Steve Stivers, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement, "These are troubling charges leveled against Congressman Hunter. I trust our judicial system and eagerly await more facts surrounding the case."

Allegations of lavish spending

Hunter's campaign credit card allowed the family to take lavish vacations that they could not otherwise afford, according to the indictment filed Tuesday in federal court in San Diego.

Investigators found that Margaret Hunter concealed the name or location of their destination by purchasing tickets for personal vacations by using websites like Expedia. Among the trips using campaign funds: a 2015 family vacation in Italy over Thanksgiving totaling more than $14,000; an April vacation in Hawaii costing $6,500; and a $3,700 trip to Las Vegas and Boise in July 2015.

In addition to family trips to fast food and fine dining establishments, as well as venues like the Del Mar Racetrack, the Hunters allegedly also spent thousands of dollars of campaign funds on routine purchases for personal items at Costco ($11,300), Walmart (more than $5,700), Barnes & Noble, Target and Michael's craft store.

In one of Margaret Hunter's trips to Target, she allegedly spent more than $300 in campaign funds for "a tablecloth, three square pillows, a three-brush set, a metal tray, four temporary shades, four window panels, a white duck, two Punky Brewster items, a ring pop and two five-packs of animals," according to court documents. She described the purchases as being needed for "teacher/parent & supporter events."

Hunter repeatedly pushed back on inquiries from his treasurer about his and his wife's spending. For example, the Hunters allegedly spent nearly $2,000 on a November 2010 birthday gift for a family member to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game at Heinz Field. When questioned by his treasurer about whether the expense was campaign related, the congressman gave a curt response: "Yessir."

When the treasurer explicitly told the congressman in December 2010 that he could not use campaign funds "for a leisure outing at which the discussion occasionally focuses on the campaign," Hunter asked the treasurer if he was "trying to create some kind of paper trail" on him.

When the treasurer threatened to resign, Hunter promised that he would instruct his wife not to use the campaign credit card and put it in a safe place.

The indictment underscores that the Hunters also spent campaign money to entertain friends, family members and associates, many of whom are not named in the court documents.

In one instance in January 2010, the congressman allegedly spent more than $1,000 for a three-night stay at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for what was described as a "personal ski trip" with a person identified in the indictment only as "Individual 14."

The indictment states that in June 2011, Hunter used $162 in campaign funds "for a personal stay at the Liaison Capitol Hill hotel with Individual 14."

When the campaign fell short at the end of 2012, and the treasurer informed Hunter they could not pay outstanding bills, Hunter allegedly told his aide that he would raise between $11,000 and $15,000 from campaign donors to address the shortfall by the middle of the next month.

Hunter, a former Marine, has reimbursed his campaign account some $65,000 since the Federal Election Commission first questioned spending on video games in 2016, according to FEC records.

"There was wrong campaign spending, but it was not done by me," Hunter told KGTV-10, a San Diego television station, earlier this year.

Hunter's lawyers said last year that "any mistakes were made they were strictly inadvertent and unintentional."

Re-election fight

California's 50th District is a staunchly Republican district with many current and former military families. The congressman's father, Duncan L. Hunter, represented parts of the district (which changed after redistricting) and has rallied donors and supporters to his son's side.

Hunter's Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a former Department of Labor aide in the Obama administration, has repeatedly outraised him.

Many Hunter allies believe he will stay in his House seat while fighting the charges.

Even if federal candidates choose to withdraw from contention, their names will remain on the ballot unless they seek removal of their names from a judge, according to the California Secretary of State's Office.

At this late juncture, there is no possibility of a write-in campaign. Only Hunter and Campa-Najjar will appear on the November ballot, since they were the top vote-getters in California's top-two primary in June.
__label__politics (CNN) Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday to eight criminal counts and implicated Trump himself in a remarkable courtroom moment.

Cohen admitted that "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office," he kept information that would have harmed Trump from becoming public during the 2016 election cycle.

The charges against Cohen, an attorney for Trump until earlier this year and a member of his inner circle throughout his presidential campaign, bring a climactic end to a months-long investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. And they expose, through the criminal information filed against Cohen in court, that he acted with Trump and his allies, including David Pecker, the CEO of the National Enquirer's publisher, American Media Inc., to suppress potentially damaging claims against the now-President.

The dramatic conclusion to the investigation into Cohen launches a fresh round of questions about Trump's actions. Though Trump himself isn't named, the court filing refers to an Individual-1, who by January 2017 had become president of the United States.

The counts against Cohen included tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-candidate.

Though not named in the plea deal filed in court, the women whom Cohen helped silence were two who have since gone public with their claims of sexual encounters or affairs with Trump: a porn star named Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal. Trump has denied the claims.

In the case of Clifford, Cohen arranged a nondisclosure agreement for which he paid her $130,000, and for that Cohen was charged with making an excessive campaign contribution, since the payment was made in service of the campaign and exceeded the federal limit.

For McDougal, Cohen and the CEO of a media company "worked together to keep an individual from publicly disclosing" information that would have been harmful to a candidate, saying the individual received $150,000. In the summer of 2016, American Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for a contract that effectively silenced her claims of an affair with Trump.

"In or about August 2015, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Corporation-1 ("Chairman-1"), in coordination with MICHAEL COHEN, the defendant, and one or more members of the campaign, offered to help deal with negative stories about Individual-l's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided," the criminal information says. "Chairman-1 agreed to keep COHEN apprised of any such negative stories."

Though the corporation and its chairman are not named, court filings describe the corporation as "a media company that owns, among other things, a popular tabloid magazine."

A spokesman for AMI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The court filings also link AMI to Clifford, saying that in October 2016, an agent for an adult film actress contacted the company and said she was willing to go public with her allegations of an affair with Trump. Pecker then contacted Cohen, and Cohen negotiated with the woman's attorney to "purchase [her] silence" for $130,000.

After Cohen failed to either execute the agreement immediately or pay the woman, she threatened, in late October -- 14 days before the election -- to Pecker to take her story to another publication. Pecker then informed Cohen, in part by calling him on an encrypted phone app. He told Cohen that the deal needed to be completed "or it could look awfully bad for everyone," according to court filings. Cohen then agreed to make the payment and finalize the deal.

Appearing in court on Tuesday, Cohen said of the charge linked to McDougal that it was done "for the principal purpose of influencing the election." Regarding the charge linked to Clifford, Cohen said the money "was later repaid to me by the candidate."

Assistant US Attorney Andrea Griswold said prosecutors would have been prepared to present evidence during a trial that these were so-called hush payments.

"The proof on these counts at trial would establish that these payments were made in order to ensure that each recipient of the payments did not publicize their stories of alleged affairs with the candidate," she said.

Cohen faces up to 65 years in prison.

Judge William H. Pauley set a sentencing date for Cohen for December 12. The judge set a $500,000 bond, which must be co-signed by Cohen's wife and another party.

When checking if he was of sound mind, Pauley asked Cohen whether he had consumed alcohol. Cohen replied that he had some alcohol with dinner the previous evening -- a glass of Glenlivet 12, on the rocks.

The charges against Cohen also covered a range of his activity outside of his work for Trump. In the tax evasion scheme linked to his taxi medallion business, Cohen failed to report more than $4 million in income, according to the criminal information filed against him, resulting in his avoidance of more than $1.4 million in taxes he would have had to owe the Internal Revenue Service.

Cohen also pleaded guilty to making false statements to a bank by understating his medallion debt in order to secure loans to buy property. He had omitted a $14 million line of credit on applications so that he could purchase properties, including a Park Avenue condominium and a summer home. He also got a $500,000 home equity line of credit in April 2016, a loan he never would have gotten if the bank knew of the $14 million debt, the court filings say.

Shortly after 4 p.m. on Tuesday, after having surrendered to the FBI, Cohen entered court in a dark suit, white shirt and gold tie, followed moments later by his attorney, Guy Petrillo.

Also in attendance to observe Cohen's guilty plea in court were Deputy US Attorney Robert Khuzami and the public corruption chief for the Southern District of New York.

"These are very serious charges that reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty," Khuzami said outside the courthouse following the proceedings. "They are significant in their own right. They are particularly significant when done by a lawyer."

By pleading guilty, both Cohen and prosecutors avoid the spectacle and uncertainty of a trial. But the plea deal is a significant blow for Trump, as Cohen was part of Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, working as his personal attorney at the Trump Organization and continuing to advise the President after the election. Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump, but the relationship between the two men has frayed since an FBI raid in April of Cohen's office, hotel room and home.

In turn, Trump has distanced himself from Cohen, who has told friends he has felt isolated, according to the friends . Last month, Cohen told ABC News his loyalty is to his family and country first, not the President.

The Cohen investigation was referred to the Southern District of New York by special counsel Robert Mueller. The plea deal does not include cooperation by Cohen, and it is unclear if he will follow through on his previous assertion to friends , according to sources, that he is willing to talk to Mueller.

It's not clear how the plea deal with Cohen might affect other entities that have been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors as part of the Cohen investigation, including AMI or Pecker.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the alcohol that Cohen said he drank on Monday night.
__label__politics Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been found guilty on eight counts of financial crimes, a major victory for special counsel Robert Mueller.

But jurors were unable to reach a verdict on 10 charges, and Judge T.S. Ellis declared a mistrial on those counts.

Manafort was found guilty of five tax fraud charges, one charge of hiding foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud. He faces a maximum of 80 years in prison.

The news came at the same time Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was in a New York federal court to plead guilty to multiple counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud.

Landing in Charleston, West Virginia, Trump said that the charges Manafort was convicted of on Tuesday have "nothing to do with Russian collusion" and criticized Mueller's investigation for arriving at this point.

__label__world (CNN) The author of the hit novel "Crazy Rich Asians" is wanted in his birth country of Singapore for failing to register for national service, according to the country's Ministry of Defense.

Kevin Kwan, whose book inspired the breakout movie of the same name, could face up to three years imprisonment for failing to register for the service.

"Mr Kevin Kwan failed to register for National Service (NS) in 1990, despite notices and letters sent to his overseas address. He also stayed overseas without a valid exit permit. Mr Kwan is therefore wanted for defaulting on his NS obligations," the Ministry statement, emailed to CNN, states.

The cast of "Crazy Rich Asians" pose alongside author Kevin Kwan (far right) at the movie's premiere in Hollywood.

"In 1994, his application and subsequent appeal to renounce his Singapore citizenship without serving NS were rejected. Mr Kwan has committed offenses under the Enlistment Act, and is liable to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three years upon conviction."

Despite widespread interest in the film, much of which is set in the city state, Kwan didn't make an appearance at a red carpet event for the movie in Singapore, unlike the majority of the Singaporean members of the cast.

__label__world Kerala, India (CNN) Idicula Gevarghese, forced to abandon his home in the town of Venmoney in the southern Indian state of Kerala last week, returned with his family on Monday to the ruins of their lives.

Three of them -- himself, his wife and their granddaughter -- came back to the swamped house armed with disinfectant, and began the overwhelming task of clearing out five days of muck and water.

They had left in a hurry the previous week, anxious about getting stranded in the floodwaters that swept through the villages and towns of southern Kerala just a day later.

"Everyone left. So we also left. By the grace of God, at least we are living," he tells CNN.

Idicula Gevarghese stands with his wife, Susamma Dikla, and granddaughter Shobita outside their flooded home in Venmony, Kerala.

After they left, Gevarghese checked in on the property every day, watching as the swirling, filthy water rose inexorably, submerging their belongings.

Starting almost two weeks ago, large parts of Kerala were devastated as flash floods swept through the state. Some parts, like Gevarghese's home of Venmony, held out for a week, but eventually succumbed. Rivers overflowed and sewage lines were blocked as water rushed through streets and homes across large swaths of the state.

Victims of the floods wade through waist-deep water in Kerala.

He laments how much of the family's belongings are ruined -- the water pump, the fridge, their beds and sofas are all damaged. The wood of the cupboards is spoiled. He tells CNN that he's estimated his losses at around 100,000 rupees (about $1,400).

Residents of Venmony in Kerala wait outside their homes and shops for relief.

In almost every home in the area, it's the same story. Electronics have short-circuited and even the goods residents had piled on top of high shelves and on tables fell prey to the rising waters.

Among the ruins of Gevarghese's home, the strong odor of disinfectant can't mask the pervasive rotting smell of water-damaged wood and waterlogged upholstery.

Waiting for assistance

In Venmony families cluster together, sheltering on stoops outside their homes as they wait for some kind of relief.

A truck, carrying about 20 young men, rolls up. Cheers fill the streets and smiles break out as the men throw packets of biscuits and bottles of water into the crowd. Singling out women among the faces, the men hand out packets of sanitary pads as people run alongside the truck begging for candles.

Boats are used to rescue victims of the floodwaters.

With the power out for days, candles provide the only respite from the dark.

The truck's owner, Sam Daniel, collected the provisions from residents in his town 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) away, which escaped the floods. He decided that he needs to help out in this "severe situation."

He says that the government is too stretched to take care of these rural populations. "The government thinks that they need to manage relief camps. But what about isolated places like this?" he asks.

"(The residents) have money but what good will that do? Money can't help them here."

Rescuers wade through the floodwaters.

Emergency funds

But at the regional level, money is sorely needed.

The Kerala chief minister has estimated a total loss of over Rs 19,000 crore ($2.7 billion) from the devastating floods and has requested Rs 2,600 crore ($371 million) from the national government. So far Kerala has received only around the equivalent of Rs 600 crore ($85.8 million).

The government has allocated almost 90,000 tons of grain in emergency relief, which has been airlifted in by the Indian Air Force. Alongside food, 65 metric tons of emergency drugs, 10 million chlorine tablets and tons of bleaching powder have also been hurriedly dispatched.

An Indian air-force helicopter on rescue mission flies through a flooded area in Chengannur in the southern state of Kerala on August 19.

Collection centers have been set up across the state and tons of food, clothes, sanitary supplies, bottled water -- some of it donated by locals who escaped the worst of the rains and by nongovernmental organizations along with that purchased by the state government -- are loaded into trucks.

The state government has been pouring relief and material into the towns, racing against time to deal with possible outbreaks of disease, removing the remains of animals caught in the floods and trying to contain sewage.

Indian Army personnel and Kerala state police work to build a temporary bridge over a rocky river following heavy flooding in Nelliyampathy in Palakkad district of Kerala.

On the national highways crisscrossing the state, trucks carrying fishing boats from the coast to assist in the rescue line the streets and trucks loaded with supplies stand outside relief camps, set up ad hoc by the state government.

Coping

But even as the government is scrambling to reach out to everyone in the state, certain areas seem to have fallen off the radar.

In Venmony, even with knee-high water surrounding their house, Rohi Philip and a handful of his family members and neighbors seem cheerful and optimistic. After running low on supplies, they received some much-needed aid from the Fire and Safety force Sunday.

It couldn't have come any sooner. "We had only one candle last night for the entire group. We sat together in the dark after it went out," says Philip's son, Adarsh.

Nearby, 18-year-old Ashwin Dev and his parents had to take refuge in a neighbor's house. "Our fridge, washing machine, sofa sets -- all ruined," he says. His father drives an autorickshaw -- a cheap form of public transport -- and he says they have "no idea where the money to replace it will come from."

The government has asked residents to report their losses with the local village council or district officials in an attempt to reassure residents that they will be compensated. But Dev is all too familiar with the snail's pace of Indian bureaucracy and harbors serious doubts that they'll ever see the money.

The last two weeks have devastated one of the country's most developed states and while money is coming in, thanks to the government and the generosity of the Indian diaspora, the rehabilitation will take more than just money.

Idicula Gevarghese prepares to leave his uninhabitable home with his wife and looks out, into where his garden once thrived.

"It will take 20 to 25 years to bring Kerala back to what it was," he says.
__label__politics (CNN) US President Donald Trump said another summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would "most likely" happen but offered no details on timing or venue in an interview with Reuters Monday.

In the interview Trump pointed to an absence of missile or nuclear tests from Pyongyang as a measure of the success he's had in dealing with the reclusive regime, which last year was threatening the US mainland with nuclear strikes.

"I stopped (North Korea's) nuclear testing. I stopped (North Korea's) missile testing. Japan is thrilled. What's going to happen? Who knows? We're going to see," Trump said.

When the two leaders met in Singapore in June, Trump praised the young autocrat , saying Kim had "to be a rough guy," but that he's "smart, loves his people, he loves his country. He wants a lot of good things and that's why he's doing this."

__label__world (CNN) Australia is suffering its worst drought in living memory, as dozens of bushfires are blazing out of control. It's hard to believe that it's winter "down under." Summer is yet to come.

The vast majority of Australians accept human-induced climate change is real and scientists have linked the current record-slashing drought to global warming, yet the subject is still highly controversial in Australian politics, and climate change skepticism is still given political space.

Turnbull is now facing a renewed leadership challenge from MP Peter Dutton. If Turnbull loses, he would be the third Australian prime minister to be ousted over climate policy in the past decade. A Dutton-led Australia would mean even less hope for those who want action on climate change.

It's difficult to comprehend why Australia -- a wealthy, developed nation that has long experienced crippling weather events -- has failed time and time again to get a coherent climate change plan together.

All the signs are there. The UNESCO heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, a 2,300-kilometer stretch rich in biodiverse marine life, is under threat, having lost more than half its coral in two mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017.

Australia's Great Barrier reef is under threat.

Australia clocked record heat in the first half of this year. The whole of New South Wales, the country's most populous state, is now 100% in drought, with some areas seeing less than 10mm of rain in July, right in the middle of winter.

It's so dry that animals are being forced to migrate -- a group of emus recently swarmed the town of Broken Hill, running down the street and gate crashing football matches in search of water and food, the Australian ABC reported.

Political survival

Political wrangling is one reason for the slow progress. Turnbull scrapped his climate policy in order to ensure his survival as prime minister.

"The history of Australian politics is that climate policy has proven in the past to be so controversial that it has resulted in prime ministers losing their jobs," said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics.

"Australians can see for themselves what's going on at the moment. They're facing a series of weather events linked to climate change -- droughts, heatwaves, fires -- and Australia's scientific communities have been telling politicians for a long time what's going on."

Instead of talking about global warming, the ruling Liberal Party's conservative faction, that has long resisted climate action, has framed the debate around electricity prices. Dutton said Tuesday that should he became leader he would set up an inquiry exploring why power was so pricey.

Australia has long battled bushfires, but scientists say climate change has made them more severe.

A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that Australians who identify with the country's conservative party are more likely to be predisposed to climate change skepticism. Of all 25 nations studied, only the United States had a stronger correlation between political ideology and belief in global warming.

It also found that link between political leaning and climate change skepticism was typically present in countries with strong fossil fuel industries, including the US, Australia, Canada and Brazil, indicating the power of industry lobbying.

Much of that lobbying happens through think tanks funded by the mining and energy industries, said John Cook, from the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University.

"The broad picture in Australia is that in the '80s the issue was much less polarized. It was in the early 1990s that conservative think tanks began attacking climate science for ideological reasons, because the consequence of climate change meant regulating industry," Cook said.

That combination of ideology and climate change skepticism is most apparent in former prime minister Tony Abbott, now a backbench MP but the most vocal critic of Turnbull's carbon reduction policy.

Abbott pointed to the US President Donald Trump's announcement to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement as a reason for Australia to scrap its own emissions targets, saying last week, "it's time to get out of Paris."

Tony Abbott, right, during his time as prime minister, with Malcolm Turnbull, who ousted Abbott from the premiership.

Abbott gave a speech to a climate-skeptic think tank in London last year, in which he made the remarkable claim that climate change was "probably doing good, or at least, more good than harm," and likened climate change action to "primitive people" who killed goats to appease volcano gods.

He has even called for new coal power stations to be built by the federal government.

Australia's coal addiction

Turnbull's energy policy was aimed at bringing the country in line with its commitment to cut carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, from 2005 levels, as Australia pledged in the Paris climate change agreement.

Australians support the agreement and climate change action more broadly -- until it hits their wallets, polls show.

Newspoll survey published in The Australian newspaper in October 2017, for example, found almost half of those polled would support dropping out of the Paris climate change agreement if it lowered energy prices.

"(Climate action) has taken too long because of the political influence of the coal industry, and as a result ... a significant rump of the current government either don't believe in climate change or don't believe Australia should do anything," Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor at Griffith University's School of Science, told CNN.

Coal sits at the Hay Point and Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminals south of the Queensland town of Mackay in Australia.

Australia is regularly referred to at the world's biggest coal exporter, and it depends heavily on the fossil fuel in its own energy mix, as well as for jobs and economic prosperity. Mining has contributed significantly to the country's record-breaking 26 consecutive years of economic growth.

Much of Australia's coal is exported to China, to fuel the Asian powerhouse's rapid development. But even China is starting to wean itself off dirty fossil fuel and is looking increasingly to renewable energy.

Australia is getting a renewable energy program off the ground, but a lack of political will has meant progress has been incredibly slow, said Harald Heubaum, an energy and climate policy expert at the University of London. The huge potential in the sunny country for solar energy is still largely unrealized.

"So a question Australia could ask is, does it really just want to be a quarry for Asia? To take the coal and gas and iron ore, and whatever precious metals it can find and export them?" Heubaum said.

"Or does it want to diversify away from that?"
__label__world (CNN) A former chief judge will review the conviction of a woman described as Australia's worst female serial killer, who currently is serving a lengthy prison sentence for murdering her four children.

Described by Australian media as "Australia's most hated woman," Kathleen Megan Folbigg was convicted in 2003 of the murder of three of her children, and the manslaughter of her fourth.

The four children died between the ages of 19 days and 19 months, over a 10-year period from 1989.

After an appeal, she was sentenced to 30 years in prison, with a non-parole period of 25 years. Folbigg has always maintained her innocence.

The inquiry was opened on the basis of a petition submitted by Folbigg, which calls into question evidence of the deaths of the children and suggests that they could have died of natural causes, Attorney-General Mark Speakman said in a statement. The case will be reviewed by former chief district court judge, Reginald Blanch.

Folbigg's defence had claimed her babies were victims of sudden infant death syndrome.

__label__world (CNN) South Korean President Moon Jae-in wants more than just peace with North Korea, he envisions an economic and diplomatic push that will transform northeast Asia to the degree the European Union has shaped that continent.

There are just two problems: he only has one five-year term in office to do so; and the United States, South Korea's most important ally, may not be on board.

As relations between the two Koreas continue to improve, with Moon due to visit Pyongyang next month for a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, negotiations between North Korea and the US have run into trouble. The longer this goes on the greater the potential for a rift to develop between Washington and Seoul.

"Things will definitely get complicated if (and) when the diplomacy seriously stalls," said Oliver Hotham, managing editor of the Korea Risk Group. "There will definitely be those in (Seoul) who will be furious with the US."

Transformative peace

In a speech last week , Moon set out an ambitious economic vision not just on the Peninsula but around the broader region, comparing his plan to the European Coal and Steel Community which eventually gave birth to the EU.

Such a plan would dramatically transform and connect the twin Korean economies, and give South Korea a land link to the rest of the Asian continent, potentially opening up hugely lucrative trading and infrastructure links.

Departing from his previously ebullient praise for US President Donald Trump's role in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table, Moon emphasized "the importance of recognition that we are the protagonists in Korean Peninsula-related issues."

"Developments in inter-Korean relations are not the by-effects of progress in the relationship between the North and the United States," he said. "Rather, advancement in inter-Korean relations is the driving force behind denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

While this may be true, there is a risk that any stall in negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington could hamper the two Koreas' plans. North Korean state media warned last week an ongoing deadlock in talks was "turning the seething expectation and hopes of the world people into impatience and disappointment."

This is largely due to the "natural wedge" which exists between Washington and Seoul, with the former focused on denuclearization above all else and the latter looking towards a broader peace regime, Jeong-ho Roh and Adena Peckler of the Center for Korean Legal Studies at Columbia University said in an email.

"This wedge has not necessarily been developed by North Korea, but North Korea is leveraging it -- by pressuring Seoul to now convince Washington to ease sanctions, while delaying discussion of concrete steps for denuclearization," they added.

In an editorial Tuesday, the North Korean state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said "the adoption of a war-end declaration is a task that brooks no further delay."

"Its adoption is of weighty significance in ensuring the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world, to say nothing of the confidence-building between (North Korea) and the US and the improvement of their relations," it said.

In a statement made to CNN Wednesday, a South Korean government spokesman said Washington and Seoul "have been in very close coordination and cooperation in the process of building peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula including a declaration of the end of the Korean War."

Treaty tribulations

Technically, the Korean War which broke out in 1950 has not ended, a 1953 armistice agreement stopped fighting but did not evolve into a legally binding peace treaty.

Both Koreas have made clear their desire for just such a treaty, and Moon has promised to declare an end to the war by the end of this year, perhaps during his trip to the North next month.

While a formal peace regime officially ending the Korean War would need buy in from the US and China -- the other participants in the conflict -- experts agree that there is nothing to stop the two Koreas declaring an end to the war themselves, or signing a bilateral peace treaty.

Both Koreas shut down a handful of guard posts along the DMZ Wednesday, according to officials in Seoul, part of a process of gradual demilitarization of the heavily fortified border.

This could enable South Korea to lift sanctions and move forward with greater economic engagement with the North, plans for which Moon has been promoting. That would leave Washington in an awkward spot, Roh and Peckler said, "the US can either not recognize a bilateral peace treaty as a legitimate and legal end to the Korean War, or actively block South Korea from signing it."

Doing so could alienate Seoul and the broader international community, and leave North Korea to take "center stage in the establishment of an internationally recognized peace process at the exclusion of the United States."

Seoul's desire to continue ramping up economic engagement stems from Moon's insistence that doing so will benefit not only his country's northern neighbor but also South Korea itself.

In his speech last week, he cited research from a state-run organization which found inter-Korean economic cooperation could be worth upwards of $150 billion across the next 30 years.

Most important, for Moon as well as business and worker interests in the South , is the linking of rail networks, ending South Korea's geographic isolation and connecting it to China and the rest of the Asian continent.

"I propose the creation of the East Asian Railroad Community today, encompassing six Northeast Asian countries and the United States," Moon said. "The Community will expand the horizon of the Korean economy to the northern part of the continent and become the main artery of mutual prosperity in Northeast Asia. It will then lead to the creation of East Asian energy and economic communities."

Stalled talks

The Rodong Sinmun complained last week of "those opposed to dialogue provided the (US) negotiating team with a truncheon called 'theory of suspected north Korea's secret nuclear facilities,' a fiction, driving it to derailing dialogue."

This conforms with reports citing unnamed administration officials that the US has requested a full accounting of North Korea's nuclear assets before moving forward with talks or any potential economic relief.

Around the same time, the US moved to sanction companies based in Singapore, China and Russia accused of violating restrictions on trade with Pyongyang, as Washington attempted to maintain its strategy of "maximum pressure" which the Trump administration has claimed let to the detente with North Korea in the first place.

This has led many observers to expect an imminent collapse in talks, with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) saying the most likely scenario is that at some point in the near future negotiations "fall apart owing to misaligned expectations and distrust."

"The levels of bilateral trust and long-term commitment required for a phased denuclearization scenario are unlikely to be achieved under the current US administration," EIU analyst Anwita Basu said.

If they are to be saved, it will likely fall to Moon to do so, repeating the South Korean President's previous role in salvaging the Singapore summit after Trump abruptly called it off in May

"South Korea can really play the good cop to Washington's bad cop, being a more sympathetic ear to Trump's hard line on denuclearization," said Hotham. "There's certainly disagreement between Seoul and Washington on the speed at which all this peace stuff should unfold, but that disagreement actually helps this dynamic in many ways."

Moon may lose patience however, if Washington dragging its feet on reaching a compromise with Pyongyang means a significant delay to his plans for economic engagement, which depend on lifting at least some sanctions in the near term. And he may not be the only one.

"If some forces in Seoul as well as those in Beijing and Moscow want to see the peace process move faster than the denuclearization process then this could be a potentially challenging point of contention," said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

While Kim was skeptical of how much of a wedge a bilateral peace treaty would be, she agreed that Moon's plan can only be achieved via sanctions relief, adding that if North Korea does take steps towards a peace deal without the US, "Beijing and Moscow could very well lift sanctions and not implement their obligations under UN security council resolutions."

Nor are other parties likely to be willing to see a return to the threats and saber-rattling which characterized Trump's earlier approach to North Korea, leaving the US President potentially sidelined on the one foreign policy issue he has seen the most success on.
__label__world (CNN) Former Queensland policeman Peter Dutton is pushing to be Australia's 30th Prime Minister, the country's sixth in just over 10 years, as a conservative leadership coup against current leader Malcolm Turnbull gains momentum.

A rift in the ruling Liberal Party over Turnbull's climate change policy, known as the National Energy Guarantee (NEG), led to a challenge for the party's leadership on Monday morning.

Dutton, 47, a leader in the party's conservative faction, only narrowly lost a leadership contest against Turnbull and now looks likely to mount another attempt, possibly as early as Thursday.

A veteran politician who joined the Australian Parliament aged just 31, Dutton has made a name for himself in recent years as the country's immigration minister, overseeing Australia's strict border protection regime.

But the staunch conservative has also proved to be something of a controversial figure in Australian politics, following disparaging comments about immigrants.

A poll in early August found just 7% of voters from his own ruling Liberal Party wanted Dutton to be their leader, behind Prime Minister Turnbull on 51%.

However, as of Monday, almost a dozen ministers had offered their resignations to Turnbull, and with just eight votes standing between him and the most powerful job in Australia, Dutton's bid to become prime minister could soon become a reality.

Speaking to CNN, former Liberal Party leader John Hewson issued a note of caution, saying Dutton wasn't a "natural leader" and his likely policy agenda might be too extreme for average Australians.

"If Peter Dutton is the answer, what the hell's the question?" Hewson said.

Australia's then-Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton (2nd R) speaks at Parliament as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (bottom L) looks at his notes in Canberra on August 20.

Ideological rift

The ruling Liberal Party is primarily split between two ideological factions -- a moderate, pro-business grouping led by Turnbull and a large conservative faction, partially led by Dutton.

The differences between the two groups have widened in recent years, especially over immigration and climate change policy.

"(The conservatives) have a very strong ideological position and have never been convinced Malcolm Turnbull ought to be Liberal PM. They don't accept his credentials," John Warhurst, emeritus professor of Australian Politics at the Australian National University, told CNN.

The deep divisions between the two groups exploded when Turnbull tried to legislate action on climate change in line with the Paris Agreement, which many in the conservative faction want to dump altogether.

The party's right wing is now looking to install a leader from within their own faction, with Dutton emerging as the clear front runner.

A leading light of Australia's conservative movement, Dutton repeatedly opposed same-sex marriage prior to its legalization in Australia in 2017, and was one of the architects of a divisive national vote designed to stall the issue.

He was also one of a small number of politicians who boycotted then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's apology in 2008 to the Aboriginal children taken from their parents by force for decades.

If the former immigration minister takes power in coming weeks, Australia's government is likely to move further to the right on migration, climate changes and social issues ahead of a national election, due to be held by May 2019 at the latest.

But Hewson said he didn't believe that a "hard line right" policy platform, similar to that of US President Donald Trump, could be successful in Australia. "If you give up the center ground, you'll make it truly hard to win an election," he said.

Changes to immigration?

Australia has long considered itself a successful multicultural, immigrant nation, with almost one in four of the country's population in 2017 originally born overseas.

But as the country's immigration minister since 2014, Dutton has been a longtime advocate for lower immigration and harsher tests on potential migrants to Australia.

Speaking to Sky News following his narrow loss in Monday's leadership ballot, Dutton reiterated his previous statements that immigration numbers needed to be cut.

"It's clear the Australian public particularly in capital cities ... have a view that the migration number is too high, people sitting in congested traffic each day when they go to work or go and pick the kids up," he said

In 2016, he complained to Sky News about immigrants who "won't be numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English," adding they would be taking Australian jobs.

At the same time as he has voiced concern over immigration numbers, Dutton sparked controversy by suggesting a special visa category could be created to allow white South African farmers, allegedly persecuted in their home country, to come to Australia as refugees.

"I do think on the information I've seen people do need help and they need help from a civilized country," Dutton told Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph on March 14.

Speaking to CNN at the time, South African farmers groups denied there was a need for a special refugee visa at this stage.

Climate change action unlikely

In early 2015 Dutton was picked up on an overhead microphone speaking to then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott about a recent trip to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.

Abbott said he was sorry he was late, he was still running on "Cape York time" to which Dutton responded, "Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your doors," he said, joking about the effects of climate change.

Dutton apologized for the joke but the conservative politician is likely to take a dim view of any action on climate change.

The Liberal Party's conservative faction is very hostile towards the Paris Agreement, with many calling for it to be ditched, and instead advocating for greater coal power in Australia.

Following his loss to Turnbull on Friday, Dutton said he wanted to lower energy prices for Australian families, and called for a national inquiry into how expensive electricity bills had become.

"Australian consumers for way too long have been paying way too much for fuel and for electricity," he told local radio station Triple M.

Ian Lowe, Emeritus Professor at Griffith University's School of Science, told CNN that action on climate change under a potential Dutton government was highly unlikely, given the objections to Turnbull's "inadequate" policy.

"It's clear the faction won't take any serious action to slow down climate change, they will argue the government's duty is to have a secure energy supply at as low cost as possible, and they will say that means keeping old, dirty coal fired power stations open as long as possible," he said.
__label__world (CNN) For more than three decades, the Catholic Church has been rocked by sex abuse scandals spanning the globe.

And for decades, the church has been accused of protecting itself rather than the victims of child sexual abuse.

Here are some major scandals and revelations involving the Catholic Church and allegations of abuse.

USA, 2018

The report said internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania -- some held in a secret archive to which only the bishop had a key -- showed that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims.

The letter directly referred to the Pennsylvania report, which "detailed the experiences of at least 1,000 survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately 70 years."

Looking ahead, the pontiff said the church was working on a "zero tolerance" policy on abuse and coverups. He added, "If, in the past, the response was one of omission, today we want solidarity, in the deepest and most challenging sense, to become our way of forging present and future history."

USA, 2018

In July 2018, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, who once led the Archdiocese of Washington and was a force in American politics, after a decades-old allegation of sexual abuse of a teenage altar boy forced the Vatican to remove him from public ministry.

A month earlier, McCarrick issued a statement saying he was shocked by the allegations: "While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people."

McCarrick was also accused three times of sexual misconduct with adults "decades ago" while he served as a bishop in Metuchen and Newark, New Jersey, the current bishops of those cities said in June. Two of those allegations resulted in settlements, the bishops said.

The Vatican said Pope Francis had ordered McCarrick to "a life of prayer and penance until the accusations made against him are examined in a regular canonical trial."

Chile, 2018

Pope Francis called the country's bishops to Rome in May after he received a 2,300-page report detailing sexual abuses by priests in Chile.

The report alleged that for decades, church officials in Chile had known about cases of sexual abuse and led a massive cover up, even destroying records.

Seven years earlier, the Vatican had found Chilean priest Father Fernando Karadima guilty of child sex abuse.

In January, while visiting Chile, Francis defended a Chilean bishop accused of concealing the abuse, saying he had been "slandered."

But after Vatican investigators said church officials in Chile had helped cover up multiple cases of sexual abuse by the clergy, the Pope apologized.

After the 3-day emergency summit at the Vatican in May to discuss the sex abuse scandal, all 34 of Chile's active and retired bishops offered the Pope their resignations.

In August, police arrested one former priest over the alleged abuse of seven minors. Prosecutors say there are 158 people including bishops, priests and lay people under investigation.

Australia, 2018

Wilson was the highest-ranking Catholic official ever to be convicted of covering up sex abuse.

In July he said that he intended to appeal the ruling under the "due process of law" and would resign if his appeal was unsuccessful.

The next week the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had accepted Wilson's resignation.

Australia, 2017

Australian Cardinal George Pell was charged with historical child sex offenses.

Cardinal George Pell, one of the most senior members of the Catholic Church, was charged with multiple historical sexual assault offenses in his home country of Australia, police said in June.

Pell serves as a top adviser to Pope Francis and heads the Vatican's secretariat for the economy. In 2013, he was named one of eight cardinals tasked with investigating ways to reform the church. He is the most senior member of the Catholic Church in Australia but has been placed on leave from the Vatican while the allegations are investigated.

Pell said he's innocent and maintains that the charges -- relating to claims of sexual abuse spanning three decades -- are false.

In May 2018, a magistrate ordered him to stand trial and he entered a formal plea of not guilty.

In a statement, the Vatican said: "The Holy See has taken note of the decision issued by judicial authorities in Australia regarding His Eminence Cardinal George Pell. Last year, the Holy Father granted Cardinal Pell a leave of absence so he could defend himself from the accusations. The leave of absence is still in place."

A 2017 commission found that 7% of Australian priests were accused of abusing children between 1950 and 2015.

Dominican Republic, 2014

Jozef Wesolowski died in 2015 before he went to trial.

Jozef Wesolowski, a former Vatican ambassador to the Dominican Republic was found guilty of sexual abuse of minors by a Vatican tribunal and defrocked in 2014. He was accused of sexual abuse of minors and possession of child pornography during his time as papal nuncio to the Dominican Republic. Italy's Corriere della Sera reported that Wesolowski's laptop contained more than 100,000 files with pornographic images and videos.

Wesolowski was the highest-ranking Catholic official arrested for alleged sexual abuse of minors. He died in 2015, before he could be put on trial.

The Netherlands, 2011

Thousands of children suffered from sexual abuse in the Dutch Roman Catholic Church over more than six decades, and about 800 "possible perpetrators" have been identified, according to an independent Commission of Inquiry, issued in 2011.

The commission said it received 1,795 reports of church-related sex abuse of minors and the "reports contained information about possible perpetrators."

Multiple countries, 2010

JUST WATCHED Pope Benedict and the sex abuse scandal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pope Benedict and the sex abuse scandal 02:30

Allegations of sexual abuse spread across a half dozen countries -- including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Brazil, home of the world's largest Catholic population.

Revelations about church abuse included the Munich, Germany, archdiocese where Pope Benedict XVI once served as archbishop.

Under the Pope's tenure as archbishop in the early 1980s, the Munich archdiocese ignored warnings to keep a molesting priest away from children, said the doctor, Werner Huth, who issued those warnings.

Huth demanded the priest, Rev. Peter Hullermann, never be allowed to interact with children again. Instead, the church allowed the priest to return to work and to deal with children. Hullermann was convicted of abusing minors in 1986. Pope Benedict had left the Munich archdiocese for a new post in 1982.

Ireland, 2009

A bombshell report commissioned by the Irish government concluded that the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up clerical child abuse.

The Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation's 720-page report said that it has "no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up" from January 1975 to May 2004, the time covered by the report. The commission had been set up in 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the Irish capital.

The report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children. Of the other 35, it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two.

USA, 2004

Children accused more than 4,000 priests of sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002, according to a report compiled by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

The report, based on church records, found that 6,700 of the 11,000 allegations were investigated and substantiated, and another 1,000 were unsubstantiated. The remaining 3,300 were not investigated because the priests involved had died by the time the allegation was made.

USA, 2002

Former priest John Geoghan became a central figure in the clergy sexual abuse crisis in Boston, along with Cardinal Bernard Law, who admitted receiving a letter in 1984 outlining allegations of child molestation against Geoghan. Law assigned Geoghan to another parish despite the allegations.

From 1962 to 1995, Geoghan sexually abused approximately 130 people, mostly grammar school boys, according to victims. Over the years, church officials ordered him to get treatment or transferred him to other parishes, but kept him on as a priest. The Boston Globe coverage on sexual abuse by clergy brought the issue to the forefront. The story was later adapted into the award-winning movie "Spotlight."

Geoghan was found guilty of molesting a boy in a swimming pool and sentenced to prison in 2002. A year later, he died after an attack by another inmate at the state prison.

Law resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002.

In 2004, Archbishop Sean O'Malley issued a statement saying that 815 people had made claims of sex abuse of a minor by a priest and 150 people had made claims against a deacon, non-incardinated, or religious order priest between 1950 and 2003.

In 2011, O'Malley published the names of 159 clerics accused of sexual assault over that time period. The names of an additional 91 clerics who had been accused were not included for reasons including their deaths before the completion of inquiries when they had not been publicly accused.

Austria, 1998

Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër of Vienna was forced to give up all his duties amid allegations he molested young boys. A statement by Groer asked for forgiveness but made no admission of guilt, reported the BBC.

USA, 1985

Father Thomas Doyle warned of sexual abuse by clergy in a report given at the US conference of bishops. It was ignored.
__label__world (CNN) For the first time in almost a year, ISIS has released what it says is a new audio message from its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

In the message, the man on the recording admits that ISIS groups are losing and that it is a test from Allah, saying they need to stick together.

The man says his followers are being tested with "fear and hunger" but says "glad tidings" will be given to those who "patiently persevere."

The audio message was published by ISIS media wing al-Furqan on Wednesday.

CNN cannot independently confirm the voice on the recording is that of al-Baghdadi.

"US Central Command is aware of the alleged audio recording," Central Command spokesperson Capt. William Urban said. "I am not going to comment on our assessment of the recording. We do not know where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is at this time, but he continues to be someone that we are interested in removing from the battlefield.

"I do not believe that any official US government source has ever claimed that he is dead." When asked whether that meant US officials believe the ISIS leader is alive, Urban said, "Yes."

If it is from Baghdadi, this is the first audio message from him to be released since the fall of Raqqa in October 2017, as ISIS-held land in Syria continues to dwindle.

The man in the recording references massive losses by ISIS. "For the believer Mujahideen, the scale of victory or defeat is not counting on a city or town being stolen or subject to those who have aerial superiority, or intercontinental missiles or smart bombs, and not how many followers they have," he says.

"The scale depends on how much faith the worshipper has," he adds.

The audio recording runs for about 55 minutes.

The speaker makes reference to recent events, including tensions between the United States and Turkey. He refers to the sanctions the United States imposed on Turkey on August 1, "just to release the pastor," referring to US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is detained in Turkey.

The man also says Russia and Iran are seeking to revolt against sanctions and avoid a similar situation to North Korea. The voice says America is using "the gang policy" and it is a "sign of weakness."

The man mentions the Syrian city of Idlib, saying Russian and Syrian military are about to storm it "with the help of traitors," a reference to some Syrian rebels. And the speaker calls on Sunni Muslims to topple the government of Jordan, which is an ally of the United States and the United Kingdom.

The speaker also gave his blessing to "lone wolves in the lands of crusaders in Canada, Europe and elsewhere for their work in supporting their brothers," and called on ISIS supporters to carry out similar, simple attacks: "A bullet or a stab or a bomb would be worth a thousand operations. And don't forget to drive into crowds in the streets."

Rare messages

Baghdadi has made only one public appearance, in July 2014, in the al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul, which was retaken by Iraqi security forces in June last year.

ISIS has since released various audio messages that it claims are from Baghdadi -- most recently, one in September 2017 that appeared to make reference to news events that happened after Russia claimed he was dead.

In February, several US officials who spoke exclusively to CNN said he had been wounded in an airstrike in May 2017 and had to relinquish control of the terror group for up to five months because of his injuries. The assessment of US intelligence agencies was based on reports from ISIS detainees and refugees in Northern Syria that emerged months after the airstrike, the officials added.

It's believed the airstrike occurred close to the date offered by the Russian military in June, when they claimed to have killed or injured the ISIS leader.

At the time, Russia's Defense Ministry said it was investigating reports Baghdadi had been killed in an airstrike on May 28, on the outskirts of Raqqa, the group's primary stronghold, which US-backed forces took back in October.

Analysts warned at the time that reports of Baghdadi's death should be treated with skepticism given the high number of previous false reports.
__label__world (CNN) A female activist is facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia for participating in and documenting Shia anti-government protests, human rights groups said on Wednesday. If convicted, she could become the first female activist ever beheaded in the ultraconservative kingdom.

Israa al-Ghomgham and her husband are two of five Shia activists facing execution over charges relating to their involvement in protests calling for more rights for about two million Shia Muslims in the kingdom's Eastern Province, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Germany-based Saudi activist Ali Adubisi. A sixth co-defendant is standing trial but is not facing the death penalty

Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim kingdom.

The charges against the group range from joining a terror group affiliated with an enemy state to participating in a protest and posting footage of it online, Adubisi told CNN.

But according to a statement from HRW, the charges "don't resemble recognizable crimes" and are "solely related to their peaceful activism."

The prosecutor called for the death penalty for al-Ghomgham, her husband and three other men during a court hearing earlier this month, according to Adubisi. It was the activists' first time in court following more than two years in detention in a Saudi prison.

The same Specialized Criminal Court, which handles terrorism cases, sentenced firebrand Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr and seven other men to death for their role in Shia protests in the same province. Al-Nimr and at least three other Shia men were executed in January 2016.

Saudi authorities have so far not responded to a CNN request for comment.

"Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behavior, is monstrous," Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW, said in a statement.

Reforms and crackdowns

Saudi Arabia, which adheres to some of the strictest interpretations of Sunni Islam in the world, has long faced criticism for laws that discriminate against women.

Over the past two years, the kingdom -- under the guidance of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- has implemented a mixed bag of social reforms, opening its first cinema in decades and loosening several morality laws, including notorious rules requiring that women receive a male guardian's permission to travel, receive an education and sometimes work and receive health care.

In June, the country ended its ban on female drivers following decades of activism from both inside and outside the Gulf nation. But in recent months, the government also arrested a number of high-profile women who had campaigned to overturn the driving ban, casting doubt on the sincerity of the Crown Prince's much-touted reforms.

While some have since been released, a handful of the women remain detained without charge, according to HRW.
__label__world Tehran (CNN) Far from the spotlight of the global standoff between the US and Iran, there is a Tehran that gets up early, stocks the food markets, attends dawn prayers and sweeps the roads before the morning traffic takes hold.

In this Iran, there is another take on the US. Here, the enemy is not the American people, but the policies of the leaders they voted for, where the smallest changes in the price of food or the value of the US dollar wreak havoc on Iranians' daily lives.

"I got things to do... I don't have time to chant 'Death to America,'" says Mohammad Reza, 42, as he fills the frozen lockers of a market stall with large plastic bags full of sheep's offal and heads dragged from the ice buckets of his truck.

This Iran is a long way from President Trump's hardline Twitter-baiting, the dismissal of new talks from Iran's Supreme Leader, and the hopes of Iranian and American moderates that diplomacy could have saved the nuclear deal that brought a delicate truce after years of tension.

It's just after 5 a.m. on Tuesday. Reza says work in his slaughterhouse has dropped in the past weeks, as the first wave of renewed US sanctions swung into effect.

"Costs keep changing every day," he said. "It's 500,000 tomans (about $50) one day for a sheep, tomorrow it could be 550,000. So it's not economically feasible for us. It's not worth it."

A currency trader holds a bundle of Iranian rial banknotes outside a bazaar in Tehran.

Around the corner from Reza, four street cleaners play football instead of brushing the road, enjoying the last moments of dark before the sun roasts Tehran's asphalt. Rahimi, 41, picks dusty plastic bottles from the grass verge.

"I am not that educated, I don't have a deep understanding," says Rahimi, who like most Iranians interviewed for this article preferred to give only their first name.

"But they [USA] don't act justly. We don't count in Mr Trump's eyes. He has problems with the government, but what's my sin? We don't count."

Trash is washed down the gutter before the market opens. Another man, carrying stacks of cabbage into a stall, said he didn't blame the US for economic hardship, but local mismanagement.

"It's got nothing to do with the USA," the man said, requesting anonymity when criticizing local officials. "They don't provide me with my bread. They are not here."

He added that his housing costs had shot up 40% in the past year and that protests -- like those that have sporadically popped up around Iran this year over economic issues -- were futile.

As with all interviews for this article, a government-provided translator was nearby.

This is poor, struggling southern Tehran, where looming renewed US sanctions have already caused a dramatic slide in the local currency, and where food prices are something that change daily.

Outside a tent, erected near a mosque so local prayers can continue as the minarets are repaired, a homeless man who slept on a bench overnight picks the scabs on his legs. A cleric arrives to lead the faithful, this, two mornings before Eid al-Adha.

About a dozen conscripts wander by, likely returned for the religious holiday from their postings, and enter the tent to pray. Two decline to be interviewed on camera as they are not allowed to show foreigners the military insignia on their arms.

Another, Sajud Ibrahimi, 25, in civilian clothing with a large backpack, said: "The people of USA are very respectable. When we chant 'death to America,' it's to the government of America not the people. We have no problem with the people of the USA."

A man takes a glance at a newspaper with a picture of US President Donald Trump on the front page, in Tehran on July.

In response to US criticism that the Iranian military has spread its influence across the region, he said: "I haven't fought in Iraq and Syria but if the military hadn't gone there, we would be fighting Daesh [ISIS] on the streets of Iran's cities."

It is two days after the 65th anniversary of the US-backed coup in 1953 that removed the democratically elected government of prime minister Mohammed Mossadegh. On that anniversary, Iran's leading diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that the US seeks regime change in Iran through "pressure, misinformation & demagoguery."

Zarif was one of the moderate architects of the 2015 deal under which the Obama administration and EU allies lifted some sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program, from which President Trump pulled out in May.

Last week, the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, created the Iran Action Group , a panel of officials intended to focus US efforts to "change the Iranian regime's behavior," fueling Iranian suspicions that Washington seeks to unseat Tehran's government.

This kind of acrimony is on display in the remains of the US Embassy in Tehran, where the CIA once plotted coups, and American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days in 1979. Inside, mannequins take the seats presumably once filled by US embassy staff, around a table, sealed inside a transparent plastic box, intended to prevent eavesdropping.

The corridors are decorated with graffiti like "there is no time for [unreadable] in Iran any more," or the former instructions for a document furnace, or a mechanical opening door to a safe room. The old passport-forging desk is laid bare in a glass case.

A passport-forging desk can still be seen inside the former US embassy in Tehran, now a museum for the public.

Taking part in a paid tour of the building are Jim and Gladys Strain from Riverdale, New York. They say they have been to every country in the world, and first came to Iran in the 1950s, on their honeymoon. Professors of psychiatry and nutrition, they have come back, they say, as they've never seen the country's south.

"People are wonderful, they are friendly, welcoming," said Gladys Strain. "They offered us roses at the airport."

Her husband added: "We are disgusted with our president. He is misbehaving." US foreign policy was dictated by its close relationship with Iran's regional adversaries of Israel and Saudi Arabia, he said.

American tourists Jim and Gladys Strain first came to Iran for their honeymoon in the 1950s.

This is the curious paradox of the standoff between the "Great Satan" and the country Trump once threatened with a crushing military response. When their people meet, they appear to get along okay. It's just their leaders -- Iranian conservatives and American Republicans -- who regularly clash.

In Kubaba, a swanky and fashionably lit Lebanese restaurant uptown, this scope for greater harmony blooms. The music throbs through the fairy lights, and the mocktails flow.

Romina and Roseanna are sisters who spend much of the year in Europe, speak fluent English, and admit they are "well off" and so have a cleaner view of the West.

"People look up to Americans, they try to recreate that way of life," said Romina, aged 22. "They don't hate them at all."

Take away the headscarves and drop some rum into the mojito and -- in the decor inspired by the owner's time in California -- this could be Europe. Yet around the cafe is a world of uncertainty, where sanctions are changing the things you used to be able to rely upon.

"Every day is something different," said Romina's sister Roseanna, 24. "What's going to happen in the next 15 years? We don't even know what's going to happen tomorrow."

The former US embassy building, covered with graffiti, now enshrines the decades long animosity between the two nations.

Hamid spends much of his time in Europe and is a businessman with a clear view that Iranians mostly see the difference between hardline American Republicans, more compromising Democrats, and don't hate their electorate.

"Most of the Iranian people used to travel to America, now with the sanctions I am not sure," he said. "They are fed up with the politics, but with the American people, no."

As an Oreos birthday cake sparkles its way on a waiter's tray towards the gaping smile of a chubby 8-year-old. No different from anywhere in the West, yet a world of crippling sanctions away.

__label__politics Jerusalem (CNN) The United States will exert "maximum pressure" to prevent Iran from developing its nuclear program, US national security adviser John Bolton said during a press conference in Jerusalem Wednesday.

Bolton's visit to the region came amid mounting tensions between US and Iran over sanctions, and fears over escalating violence in Syria.

US President Donald Trump announced moves to pull out of the Iran deal in May, abandoning the multinational agreement that had been struck to curb Iran's nuclear program.

The Trump administration began reimposing sanctions earlier this month, with more due to take effect in November against the Iranian oil industry, which accounts for a fifth of the country's GDP.

On Wednesday, Bolton defended Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions, calling Iran "the central banker of international terrorism since 1979."

He added that the deal gave the regime "new assets it could use for its nuclear weapons program, for its ballistic program, for its terrorist activities."

"What we want is massive change in the regime's behavior," Bolton said. But he added: "Regime change in Iran is not American policy."

Earlier this week, in an exclusive interview with CNN, Iranian Foreign Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the US of having an "addiction to sanctions," and deploying them as a weapon that had been proven not to work.

"We felt that the United States had learned that at least as far as Iran is concerned, sanctions do produce economic hardship but do not produce the political outcomes that they intended them to produce, and I thought that the Americans had learned that lesson. Unfortunately I was wrong," Zarif said.

Bolton issues warning

Addressing Syria, Bolton acknowledged the Assad regime's plan to retake Idlib, one of the last rebel-held enclaves in the country.

He said the US was "concerned" about the possible use of chemical and biological weapons "once again."

"Let there be no confusion, if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons we will respond," he said.

In April, the US, UK and France launched strikes against targets at three sites in Syria, in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians in the Damascus enclave of Douma. Damascus denied using such weapons.

Asked in an interview with Reuters if there was an understanding with Russia about any plans by the Syrian regime to launch a full-scale offensive in Idlib, Bolton said there was not.

Bolton also said the Trump administration's intention was to remove Iranian forces from Syria completely, a goal echoed by the Israeli government. Bolton said he would discuss the possibility of Iranian withdrawal with his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, when the two meet on Thursday in Geneva.

Bolton said the removal of Iranian forces was also a Russian interest, though he added Russia can't go it alone.

"Perhaps US-Russia joint efforts might be sufficient (to remove Iran)," said Bolton at the press conference. "I'm not sure."

No timing for peace deal

Bolton also stood by the Trump administration's decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as the "right thing to do."

"It was a very positive step forward, not only for Israel, but for the Palestinians as well," he added.

US opened its new embassy in Tel Aviv in May, despite international criticism and fierce objections from the Palestinian Authority. Following the announcement, the Palestinian Authority froze relations with the Trump administration and has vowed to automatically reject any peace plan put forward by the US.

But that hasn't deterred Trump.

At a rally in West Virginia Wednesday, the US President said that Palestinians would "get something very good" in return for the embassy move, but Bolton wouldn't give any specifics on what that may be.

"As a dealmaker, as a bargainer, he would expect, I would expect, you would expect the Palestinians would say, 'OK, we didn't get that one, now we expect something else.'"

Asked about the timing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan promised by the US administration, Bolton only said that it was still being formulated and no decisions have been made about its release.

But Bolton took a swipe at the Palestinian Authority when he was asked about a potential ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

"If Hamas cared more about the people of the Gaza Strip than their political priorities, we wouldn't have a lot of these troubles," said Bolton, "and I think it's a sad outcome for the Palestinian people that all they've got now is a choice between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority."
__label__politics (CNN) A Washington D.C. judge has thrown out a defamation case against a former British spy by three Russian oligarchs over a dossier alleging Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections.

Ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele won the legal battle against billionaires Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan, who claimed he defamed them in the so-called dossier , which was published online in January 2017.

On Monday, Judge Anthony C. Epstein of the District of Columbia District Court upheld Steele's bid to have the case dismissed.

Epstein ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove Steele was aware that some information in the dossier was incorrect or that he acted "with reckless disregard as to its falsity."

Steele's lawyers had argued that the case was an attempt to silence him. The Russians maintained he wasn't entitled to free speech protections because he is not an American citizen.

__label__politics (CNN) In the wake of an absolutely stunning 60 minutes of revelations on Tuesday afternoon , you might have been tempted to wonder whether President Donald Trump was in real legal jeopardy.

After all, his one-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified as part of a plea agreement in New York City that then-candidate Trump had "directed" and "coordinated" his efforts to hide payments discussed in the run-up to the 2016 election to two women -- porn star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal -- in an effort to keep their allegations of extramarital affairs with Trump out of the press. (In Daniels' case, a $130,000 payment was made, which Trump then reimbursed Cohen for , according to his lawyer.)

That is a violation of campaign finance laws, one of the eight charges that Cohen pleaded guilty to on Tuesday. And so, if Cohen admitted he broke the law and testified that he did it at the direction of the President then, well, isn't Trump in deep trouble?

Probably not. And the reason is that special counsel Robert Mueller's office has apparently signaled to the President's legal team that they will abide by longstanding Justice Department regulations that stipulate that a sitting President can't be indicted. "All they get to do is write a report," Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash in May. "They can't indict. At least they acknowledged that to us after some battling, they acknowledged that to us."

To be clear: There is a debate in the legal community about the prohibition on indicting a sitting president, but it seems unlikely Mueller would push for an indictment as a direct result of his investigation.

The more likely threat to Trump -- and this is as true following the Cohen plea deal and Paul Manafort's conviction as it was a week ago -- is the possibility that the House takes up articles of impeachment against him.

Take a step back: This case has always moved on two related but not identical tracks. There is the legal end of things, which has led to a series of criminal charges out of the Mueller team and its most high-profile conviction in the form of Trump's former campaign chairman, Manafort, on Tuesday. Then there is the political track, which has to date taken a back seat to the legal jockeying but is the far more dangerous path for Trump.

At some point in the (relatively?) near future, Mueller and his team will release the findings of their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, whether any collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign existed and whether Trump obstructed justice by getting in the way of the investigation.

Is it possible that Mueller will, contra Giuliani, push for Trump to be indicted? I mean, anything is possible. But what's much more likely is that Mueller -- in deference to established Justice Department protocols --will simply let the report speak for itself.

Assuming Mueller does that, the political track will be the only way in which Trump could be punished in any meaningful way. To date, national Democrats have been reluctant to talk too much about possible impeachment proceedings against Trump -- leaving that sort of talk to a small number of ultra-liberal members of the party.

It remains to be seen whether Tuesday's events change the minds of people like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. But at least one somewhat unlikely source believes that the Manafort conviction on eight counts of financial crimes and the Cohen plea agreement have put impeachment very much on the ballot in November.

"Today clarifies that November is a referendum on impeachment -- an up or down vote," Steve Bannon, Trump's one-time senior strategist told Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs on Tuesday night . "Every Trump supporter needs to get with the program."

That's a startling statement by Bannon, although he may not be wrong about it. If Democrats win back control of the House in the coming midterm election -- and they are favored to do so -- it's hard to imagine calls for impeachment from their party's base wouldn't grow louder after the events of Tuesday.

The wild card, of course, is what Mueller's report ultimately finds. If it fully exonerates Trump, a move toward impeachment would likely be cast as a pure political ploy by Democrats. If it doesn't clear Trump, however, then Democrats will likely seriously consider the idea of impeachment. The question at that point is whether any Republicans would join them.

Tuesday changed a lot of things in political Washington.

One thing it didn't change is that the real threat to Donald Trump's presidency in all of this isn't indictment. It's impeachment.
__label__politics (CNN) One of the most galling aspects of Tuesday's breathtaking indictment of Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter and his wife, Margaret, was how the former Marine could allegedly act with such blatant disrespect for the military he once served in.

Beyond the accusations of the Hunters' graft and extravagance -- from in-cabin flights for the family's pet bunny to an $14,000 Italian vacation financed with campaign funds -- the indictment has opened Hunter to intense scrutiny from the many current and former service members who live in California's 50th District, where veterans compose nearly 10% of eligible voters.

In interviews earlier this year, some veterans told CNN they were puzzled by how a Marine who had served three combat tours overseas could so brazenly break the rules, or claim that suspicious charges on his campaign credit card were innocent mistakes. In some cases, that was one reason why they didn't believe the allegations swirling around him.

Now, in the indictment, federal prosecutors detailed a disturbing pattern where, they say, the Hunters attempted to disguise their purchases as benefiting wounded servicemen and women or the military itself.

The most striking example is an alleged conversation in 2015 between Duncan and Margaret Hunter about how he was planning to buy his "Hawaii shorts" but had run out of money.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Michael Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, said Wednesday that he believes his client is willing to testify before any congressional committee without being granted immunity.

"Yes, I believe I can say that," Davis told CNN's John Berman on "New Day." "I have not specifically asked my client that question, but I'm stating my belief that the answer to that question is yes," Davis clarified.

Cohen pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday to eight criminal counts, including campaign finance violations tied to his work for President Donald Trump during the 2016 election.

Following Cohen's plea deal, Sens. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner, the ranking member on the committee, offered a rare, joint statement before reporters Tuesday, saying they had "re-engaged" with Cohen. Burr said the committee re-engaged "following press reports that suggested he had advance knowledge of the June 2016 meeting between campaign officials and Russian lawyers at Trump Tower."

Davis also told "New Day" on Tuesday that Cohen will not seek a pardon from Trump.

__label__politics (CNN) On Tuesday night, Republican California Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. was indicted on a series of counts ranging from conspiracy to campaign finance laws , all stemming from the congressman's alleged widespread misuse of campaign cash to pay for his personal life.

1. "Throughout the relevant period, the Hunters spent substantially more than they earned. They overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period resulting in approximately $37,761 in 'overdraft' and 'insufficient funds bank' fees."

Holy crap! In a seven-year period, the Hunters allegedly overdrew their bank account more than 1,000 times! Also, according to the indictment, Hunter had less than $1,000 in reportable assets listed on his personal financial disclosure forms for each year between 2009 and 2016. Talk about living beyond your means!

2. "The Hunters illegally converted and stole more than $250,000 in campaign funds to purchase goods and services for their personal use and enjoyment."

I never understand this. If you want to use $250 from your campaign to buy a few personal items, I get how you can reasonably think you won't get caught. But do you think no one will ever ask questions about $250,000?!?!

3. "Duncan Hunter facilitated the theft of campaign funds by ignoring his campaign staff's multiple warnings about Margaret's improper use of campaign funds, accusing campaign staff of disloyalty by 'trying to create some kind of paper trail on me' when they raised concerns about improper spending, and continually refusing to remove her access to campaign funds."

Ah, the old I'm-not-doing-something-wrong-you're-doing-something-wrong approach! Also, reminder: These people Hunter accused of "trying to create some kind of paper trail" worked for him at the time.

4. "The Hunters concealed and disguised the personal nature of many of their campaign expenditures by either falsely stating the expenses were 'campaign related' or by falsely reporting the item or service purchased when providing information to the Treasurer (by, for example, buying personal clothing items at a golf course so that the purchase could be falsely reported to the Treasurer as 'balls for the wounded warriors')."

Buying golf clothes for yourself and reporting it as buying golf balls for wounder warriors? Oooomph.

5. "The Hunters concealed and disguised the personal nature of their family's purchases of video games using Campaign funds by falsely claiming to a financial institution that the payments were fraudulent charges and then reporting the purchases to the FEC and the public as fraudulent charges."

Video games! And then tell your staff and the public you were hacked! Paging Anthony Weiner....

6. "The Hunters illegally used Campaign funds, among other things, to purchase the following: Hotel rooms, airline tickets and upgrades, meals and food, and entertainment expenses for vacations for themselves and their friends and family, including more than $14,000 for a family Thanksgiving vacation in Italy in November 2015; more than $6,500 for a family vacation to Hawaii in April 2015; more than $3,700 for a family vacation to Las Vegas and Boise in July 2015; more than $2,400 for a Las Vegas couples vacation in August 2011; and more vacations to destinations such as Lake Tahoe, Pittsburgh, London, and Washington."

See point No. 1. These are people living way, way beyond their means. Hawaii in April, Vegas in July and Italy in November? Pretty nice year.

7. "Household and other personal items for their family from a wide variety of stores, such as Costco (where they spent more than $11,300 in Campaign funds), Walmart (where they spent more than $5,700), Barnes Noble (where they spent more than $2,500), Target (where they spent more than $2,300), Michaels craft store (where they spent more than $2,200), and other retailers such as Aaron Brothers, Party City, World Market, Crate & Barrel, Pier 1, Penny, Sears, and Rite Aid."

Look, I get it. Costco is awesome. And those damn massive jars of mustard cost more than you think. But who the hell spends $2,200 at Michaels? Seriously that sounds like a nightmare I had recently.

8. "On or about January 25, 2010, in Incline Village, Nevada, Duncan Hunter spent $1,008.72 in campaign funds at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for food, drinks, and three nights lodging during a personal ski trip with Individual 14. On this day, the Hunter family bank account had a negative balance and incurred six separate insufficient funds fees (totaling $198). Also on this same day, Duncan Hunter withdrew $20 from his personal bank account, leaving a balance of $15.02."

That last line is a dagger. He took $20 out and has $15 -- total! -- in the family bank account.

9. "On or about April 2, 2010, Duncan Hunter claimed a $257.40 reimbursement from Campaign funds for driving his car on a 468-mile trip to Virginia Beach with Individual 14, Congressman A, and Congressman A's date despite the fact that they did not use Duncan car on the trip."

Wait, you have to use the actual car to get reimbursed for the miles? Huh!

10. "On or about May 19, 2010, in Santee, California, Margaret Hunter spent $307.72 in campaign funds at Target to purchase a tablecloth, three square pillows, a three-piece brush set, a metal tray, four temporary shades, four window panels, a white duck, two Punky Brewster items, a ring pop, and two five-packs of 'animals.' In order to conceal and disguise this illegal charge, Hunter falsely told the Treasurer that it was for 'teacher/parent supporter events.'"

Punky Brewster! Soleil Moon Frye! What a blast from the past. Also, I'm interested in knowing more about this "white duck" purchase.

11. "On or about September 13, 2010, in San Diego, California, Duncan Hunter spent $164.29 in Campaign funds for, among other things, a round of golf and beer at Riverwalk Golf Club with Individual 1A. When asked by the Treasurer if this expenditure (among several others) was campaign related, Duncan Hunter falsely responded, 'Yessir- All good.'"

The next time someone asks me if I just broke the law, I am going to respond "Yessir, all good." Amazing.

12. "On or about December 22, 2010, after the Treasurer again warned the Hunters that 'campaign funds may not be used for a leisure outing' even if campaign business is occasionally discussed, Margaret Hunter told the Treasurer that she refused to provide the names of individuals she allegedly took out for meals with campaign funds because 'that's silly.'"

"Yessir, all good!"

13. "On or about June 17, 2011 in La Mesa, California, Duncan Hunter spent $142.36 in campaign funds at the Men's Wearhouse to 're-cut' two pairs of pants. When this charge was uncovered by the Treasurer, Duncan Hunter falsely explained the charge: 'Lol. Men's warehouse was a possible semi-embarrassment that I had to let ride. I used the wrong card, then didn't want to explain the forced refund...'"

Oh, I see. You didn't want people to know you got your pants tailored at Men's Wearhouse. Or you used the wrong card? Or something? "That's silly."

14. "On or about August 6 to 10, 2011, in Las Vegas, Nevada and elsewhere, the Hunters spent $2,448.27 in campaign funds on a personal vacation with Individuals 3A and 3B. During this vacation, the HUNTER family bank account began incurring insufficient funds fees until a check from Duncan parents was deposited into the account on August 10."

A cringe-worthy detail. Even as Hunter was allegedly spending freely from campaign dollars, he was hitting his parents up for money.

15. "On or about September 12, 2011, despite opposition by his Treasurer and individuals in his Washington, DC. office, Duncan Hunter hired Margaret Hunter as his 'Campaign Manager' at a salary of $2,000 per month."

This is a move made out of desperation given the Hunters' personal financial situation. And it's one that in retrospect made things much, much worse.

16. "On or about September 16 to 19, 2011, in Boise, Idaho and elsewhere, the Hunters spent an additional $640.05 in Campaign funds for a family vacation centered on a family member's participation in a dance competition."

17. "On or about February 8 and 16, 2012, the Hunters spent $306.80 in campaign funds at United Airlines for additional charges related to a ticket for Margaret's mother to fly from San Diego to Chicago. In response to whether the charge was campaign related, Duncan Hunter told his Treasurer: 'Yes sir.'"

Works. Every. Time.

18. "On or about October 30, 2012, following an article in the San Diego Reader publicizing Margaret's salary and various expense reimbursements, Duncan Hunter relieved her of her formal duties with the campaign. Although the campaign was in dire financial condition, and had just canceled a pre-election mailer due to insufficient funds, Duncan Hunter continued to pay Margaret Hunter a salary from campaign funds and allowed her to keep her campaign credit card."

So, the congressman fires his wife as campaign manager after getting some bad press. But he keeps paying her! And lets her still have access to a campaign credit card! ( Here's the original San Diego Reader story .)

19. "On or about December 13, 2013, in Reston, Virginia, Duncan Hunter spent $63.57 in campaign funds at Best Buy to purchase a pair of gloves and a car charger for an upcoming trip to Pittsburgh."

Who the heck buys gloves from a Best Buy?

20. "On or about December 30, 2013, after considering the benefits of bringing more money to the household on a basis, Duncan Hunter hired Margaret Hunter back as Campaign Manager at a salary of $2,500 per month (although the Campaign ended up actually paying her $3,000 per month)."

She's baaaaaack!

21. "On or about July 9, 2014, the Hunters spent $250 in campaign funds at United Airlines to fly a family pet to Washington, DC. for a family vacation."

You can't go on a true family vacation without the family pet!

22. "On or about October 22, 2014, in San Diego, California, Duncan Hunter spent $204.34 in campaign funds for two greens fees, food, and drinks at the Rancho Bernardo Golf Resort, during a personal golf outing with friends, including Individual 1A. To conceal and disguise his illegal activity, he misled his Chief of Staff by describing his regular golf outing with Individual 1A as 'a Christian thing' with a supporter."

A "Christian thing"? Yessir, all good!

23. "On or about March 20, 2015, when Duncan Hunter told Margaret Hunter that he was planning 'to buy my Hawaii shorts' but had run out of money, she counseled him to buy the shorts at a golf pro shop so that they could falsely describe the purchase later as 'some [golf] balls for the wounded warriors.'"

Of all the things the Hunters have allegedly done wrong, this one is, by far, the worst.

24. "On or about July 29, 2015, in Chula Vista, California, Margaret Hunter spent $253.62 in Campaign funds at SeaWorld's Aquatica Family Waterpark to entertain family members. To conceal and disguise this illegal payment, she suggested to the Treasurer that the charges should be classified as an 'educational tour' as they were related to a 'daylong entrance and educational meet on their issues and programs.'"

Epic -- and I mean truly epic -- spin here.

25. "On or about August 17, 2015, Margaret Hunter spent $152.25 in campaign funds at to make an online purchase of cosmetics. To conceal and disguise this illegal charge, she falsely told the Treasurer that the charge was for 'gift basket items Boys and Girls Clubs of San Diego.'"

"That's silly."

26. "On or about September 26, 2015, in Anaheim, California, the Hunters spent $229.44 in Campaign funds at Disneyland's Star Trader shop on gifts, including two Minnie Mouse Ear headbands, a Star Wars droid knit beanie, and a raglan-sleeve black-and-gray Star Wars girls T-shirt. In order to conceal and disguise this transaction, Margaret Hunter falsely informed the Treasurer that the charge was for 'food/bev.'"

27. "On or about November 23, 2015 in an attempt to justify the use of campaign funds to pay for the family's trip to Italy, Duncan Hunter attempted to set up a day tour of a US naval facility in Italy. After Navy officials responded that they could only provide a tour on a particular date, Duncan Hunter said he would discuss the proposed date with Margaret Hunter, then subsequently told his Chief of Staff, 'tell the Navy to go f*** themselves [no alteration in original],' and no tour occurred."

He seems nice!

28. "On or about February 1, 2016, in response to questions raised by the Treasurer for about ten months, Margaret Hunter falsely claimed for the first time that the Steam Games charges were fraudulent."

I was hacked!

29. "On or about March 4, 2016, in Washington, DC, Duncan Hunter spent $462.46 in Campaign funds for 30 shots of tequila and one steak at El Tamarindo restaurant during Individual 8's bachelor party."

Uh, waiter, yes I'd like to make an order please. Can I have 30 shots of tequila? Also, one steak. Thanks!

30. "On or about December 31, 2016, in Alpine, California, Duncan Hunter authorized Margaret Hunter to continue receiving a salary for purportedly being the Campaign Manager."

"Yessir, all good!"
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The battle over a US Senate seat in Texas continues to heat up after a statewide poll released Wednesday shows Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke just 4 points behind Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz.

If O'Rourke were to pull off a victory, he would be the first Democrat to win a statewide seat in Texas since 1994, in a race that CNN has labeled as "Likely Republican."

According to the poll, Latinos make up 20% of the registered voters in the sample, and they favor O'Rourke with 53% support, while only 42% support Cruz.

The Texas poll was just one of several released on Wednesday, with eyes on races across the country ahead of a contentious midterm season where Republicans are in jeopardy of losing their congressional majority.

__label__politics (CNN) After unsuccessfully trying to overhaul Obamacare and Medicaid, the Trump administration is now trying to put its stamp on Medicare.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued a slew of proposed rules in recent weeks. They would change how doctors and hospitals are paid for treating senior citizens and give insurers in the Medicare Advantage program more control over the medications doctors can prescribe.

The agency says its proposals would give patients more control over their health care, reduce doctors' paperwork, cut Medicare's cost to taxpayers and help insurers lower drug prices. Health policy experts say some of the changes could ease seniors' costs, but could also make it harder for them to see their doctor of choice or get medicines their physician recommends.

Here's what the administration wants to do:

Change how doctors are paid for office visits

This controversial proposal would radically overhaul how the agency compensates physicians for the most common medical service -- a doctor's appointment.

Currently, Medicare has five levels of payments, ranging from a quick visit with a nurse to an in-depth evaluation of patients with cancer, heart failure or other serious illnesses.

The agency is proposing to reimburse doctors the same amount regardless of the person's condition and the length of the visit. Some physicians would see their payments go up, but others -- particularly specialists who treat complex medical issues -- could get less.

The change aims to let providers spend more time with their patients and less on documentation, said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It would also allow doctors to reduce their office costs, potentially offsetting their reduced compensation from Medicare.

But it could also prompt doctors to cut back on the number of Medicare patients they see or limit the time they spend with seniors, requiring them to come back for additional evaluations, experts say.

"This would create incentives for many more short visits," said Robert Berenson, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute who was in charge of Medicare payment policy at the agency during the Clinton administration.

Limit payments to hospitals for outpatient visits

Medicare currently pays more for a visit at a hospital off-site outpatient clinic than at a doctor's office. That's because the hospital can charge a so-called facility fee at these locations, which also can be a physician's office that's owned by the medical center.

The agency is proposing what it calls "site-neutral" reimbursements, meaning it would pay the same amount no matter where the patient is seen. It builds on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which limited payments to newly established off-site clinics.

"Medicare pays for things differently based on the site of care, paying more or less for the same service, but different locations," Verma said in a speech last month. "Now sometimes it makes sense, as some facilities provide a higher level of service. But other times, it creates misaligned incentives -- decisions about whether a patient receives a service in a hospital or in a doctor's office is influenced by how Medicare pays."

The move could save Medicare $760 million in 2019, and it would lower patients' co-pays to an average of $9, down from $23, each time they visit an off-site clinic, according to the agency.

It would also reduce the incentives for hospitals to buy up physician practices, a trend that has accelerated in recent years and has led to less competition and higher prices, said Paul Ginsburg, director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. Ginsburg applauded the move, but thinks the agency could go even further in limiting hospital facility fees.

Hospital groups, however, say the proposal could impede patients' access to care.

"While the agency inappropriately characterizes these clinic visits as "check-ups," the reality is that hospitals serve some of the sickest, most medically complex patients in our clinics, evaluating them for everything from metastatic breast cancer to heart failure," said Tom Nickels, executive vice president at the American Hospital Association, in a statement.

Give Medicare Advantage plans more control over medications

As part of its promise to lower drug prices, the agency will give Medicare Advantage plans more power over the medications physicians administer in their offices. These drugs, which are often for more complex conditions such as cancer, are paid for by Medicare's Part B program, as opposed to the Part D drug coverage.

In employer-based coverage, insurers have more leeway over which medications they approve, sometimes requiring that patients try a less expensive drug first. The agency will now provide Medicare Advantage plans with this tool, known as "step therapy," which it says will let these carriers negotiate prices and lower costs.

"By allowing Medicare Advantage plans to negotiate for physician-administered drugs like private-sector insurers already do, we can drive down prices for some of the most expensive drugs seniors use," said Health Secretary Alex Azar.

This change could lower prices in some circumstances, but it likely won't be widely used or lead to a lot of savings, said Juliette Cubanski, associate director for the Kaiser Family Foundation's Program on Medicare Policy. That's because many of these physician-administered drugs don't have cheaper alternatives.

Also, it means patients would have to wait before they could receive the medication that their doctor feels is best for them.

"This is putting the [insurance] plan between you and your provider," she said.

Curb Accountable Care Organizations

The agency wants to make significant changes to the main Medicare Accountable Care Organization program, which has 10.5 million participants.

Established by the Affordable Care Act, these organizations are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers who voluntarily work together to better coordinate patients' care and reduce health care costs by avoiding duplication of services and medical errors. Known as ACOs, they share in the savings they achieve for Medicare, but only a few are on the hook for any losses they generate.

The agency wants more of these organizations to share the risk if their spending per patient exceeds their targets. Currently, ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program have up to six years before they must take on risk. The agency wants to reduce that to two years.

Many policy experts and even some officials in the Obama administration agree that ACOs should have more exposure to losses. But some fear that these changes could harm the effort of shifting health care from fee-for-service, in which providers are paid for each visit or procedure they do, to a more value-based system, where they are paid based on quality and health outcomes.

"It could be a real setback for value-based or alternative payments," Ginsburg said.

The proposed changes would shake up the ACO industry. The agency projects that just over 100 -- or roughly one-fifth -- would drop out of the program. But the industry group for ACOs say that number would be much higher.
__label__politics (CNN) A former Nazi labor camp guard who had been living in the United States for decades is unlikely to face prosecution in Germany, a German official told CNN Wednesday.

Jakiw Palij, who worked as a guard at the Trawniki Labor Camp in what was then German-occupied Poland, was deported after years of diplomatic wrangling, the White House announced on Tuesday. He had been living out his post-war years in Queens, New York City.

But there isn't enough evidence to support a case against Palij, according to Jens Rommel of the Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes.

"Mere membership in the SS or even training in the Trawniki camp is no longer prosecutable under our current law," Rommel said. "That means we would have to prove, here in Germany, that an individual has either committed a murder on his own or has supported the murders of others through his actions."

Palij, 95, was born in what was then Poland and is now Ukraine, and immigrated to the US in 1949, becoming a citizen in 1957. The former Nazi guard lied to US immigration officials about his role in World War II, saying he worked on a farm and in a factory, the White House said in a statement.
__label__politics (CNN) It was like binge-watching history as two of the President's men went down.

A twisting saga of intertwined legal plots and human drama dripping with hubris, vengeance, betrayal and defiance suddenly combined Tuesday in a frenetic, barely believable burst that left Donald Trump's presidency stained by a tide of crime and corruption.

Michael Cohen, the Trump clan's attack dog, and Paul Manafort, the ultimate Washington swamp creature with the ostrich skin jacket, paid dearly for their association with their former boss in near-simultaneous convictions that will mean years in jail.

Trump's riotous, rule-breaking political career is often compared to the voyeurism of a reality show -- a perfect forum for his spinning of alternative truths and narratives.

But Tuesday's theater -- unfolding in courtrooms about 240 miles apart -- was more like the compelling denouement of a slow-building Netflix drama that came together in frenetic, shocking final moments that made their own statement: Truth and facts still matter in America.

Like all good season finales, this surreal cliffhanger tied up some plots but unleashed deeper, more consequential intrigues to tee up more compelling sequels to come. And that may evolve into existential questions for the Trump presidency itself.

For at the end of an afternoon that rocked Washington to its core, the President himself stood accused, under oath -- by his former lawyer, who once vowed to take a bullet for his boss but has now turned a smoking gun directly at him -- of conspiring in and directing a crime.

Not just any other day

Tuesday dawned like every other day of the Trump presidency in a flurry of tweets and speculation about Russian election meddling.

There was little sign of the drama to come.

In Alexandria, Virginia, court reporters filled out crosswords and played cards as the Manafort jury ground out a fourth day of deliberations.

In New York, no one expected Cohen's case to suddenly converge with the fate of the former Trump campaign chairman in such a disastrous way for the White House, though reports over the weekend had said charges were likely in his proceeding by month's end.

The first smoke that became a raging legal inferno emerged at 11 a.m., when Manafort jurors sent Judge T.S. Ellis a note. They asked what to do if they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on a single count. Ellis sent them back to their room to try to thrash it out, but it was clear: Manafort's fate was close to being resolved.

But the momentousness of the day began to take shape as sources revealed that Cohen was in talks with prosecutors on a plea deal.

Suddenly, the possibility of dual Trump-related legal dramas playing out at once looked likely as speculation washed across the split screens of news channels showing the doors of court buildings in New York and Alexandria.

By 2:30 p.m., Cohen had surrendered to the FBI. His plea agreement was a done deal and he was soon in court, in a dark suit, white shirt and gold tie.

He had center stage for only a few moments before the nation's necks twisted back to Alexandria, after Manafort attorney Kevin Downing walked into the courthouse telling reporters, "It's a note."

Fueling the drama, the President's motorcade cruised up to the 757 version of Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, where he took off for the embrace of Trump-loving West Virginia on what was rapidly becoming a disastrous day.

Down below, the Manafort jury had hit a brick wall and announced it had reached verdicts on eight counts but deadlocked on the others. Ellis resolved to talk to jurors individually, raising expectations that their travails might stretch into Wednesday.

But living up to his reputation for running a "rocket docket," the judge decided swiftly to accept a partial verdict, declaring a mistrial on the 10 unresolved charges, and Manafort's moment of destiny was suddenly at hand.

Reporters racing out of the courtroom -- where cellphones and computers are not allowed -- broke the news that Manafort had been found guilty on one count -- before similar verdicts on another seven were quickly confirmed.

As Ellis explained the verdict to Manafort, the man once known as one of the smoothest operators in politics looked on impassively. Some jurors looked him in the eye. One member appeared visibly upset as the jury left the courtroom for the final time. After a combative duel, prosecutors and defense lawyers exchanged handshakes.

And a grim-faced Manafort nodded at his wife of 40 years, Kathleen, as he was led away.

Vengeance

Washington was only beginning to wrestle with the enormity of Trump's former campaign chairman being convicted when an even more stunning scene unfolded in New York.

Cohen did not just plead guilty to eight counts of tax and bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He also fed his grudge against Trump and his belief that he had been hung out to dry by throwing his old mentor under a bus.

He testified that he made payments to hush former porn star Stormy Daniels and had urged the National Enquirer to make a similar payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said they had had affairs with Trump, in the run-up to the 2016 election "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office."

The impersonal language could not disguise the grave impact of his words -- especially since Trump had previously told the American people he knew nothing about such payments.

Effectively, Cohen was accusing the President of the United States of being a fellow crook.

Cohen read out his statement, admitting to his crimes, without emotion. He said "Yes, sir" and "Yes, your honor" when addressed by the judge. When asked if he was of sound mind and not under undue influence, he revealed that his last alcoholic drink had been a Glenlivet on the rocks at dinner Monday night.

Crestfallen, he left court with none of the swagger that he had used to effect as Trump's cleanup man.

The fight back begins

By now, Trump was back on the ground. And cornered, he acted in the only way he knew -- by fighting back.

He said he "felt badly" for Manafort but lashed out at special counsel Robert Mueller, who targeted his former campaign chairman and referred Cohen's case to prosecutors in New York.

"Nothing to do with Russian collusion, we continue the witch hunt," the President said.

Later, Trump hinted at his next political strategy, seizing on a tragedy in Iowa and an undocumented immigrant charged with the murder of student Mollie Tibbetts.

"You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly, from Mexico. And you saw what happened to that incredible beautiful young woman," Trump said at his West Virginia rally, in remarks that may resonate more with his base than Tuesday's legal drama.

Indeed, at one point the chant "Lock her up!" -- long directed at Hillary Clinton -- rang out among Trump's crowd with no apparent trace of irony given the day's events.

Those around the President are already referring to Cohen as "the rat" but they acknowledge things could hardly have gone more badly.

"What a bad day for the home team," one source said.

A source familiar with White House deliberations said staffers were "stunned" and "rattled."

Asked about Cohen and Manafort, Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders told a CNN reporter: "I don't have anything for you on that."

On Capitol Hill, Democrats were crowing.

"Not a witch hunt," tweeted Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. His Democratic colleague from Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal added that the White House was looking "increasingly like a criminal enterprise."

The sequel

As the dust settles from Tuesday's frenzy, new plot twists are already developing.

Republicans have been embarrassed, trolled and outraged by Trump -- but so far they've never deserted him.

They don't seem likely to do so now, over a campaign finance transgression, but the question has never been more acute about how history will view them, given that the President they are shielding has been implicated in his former lawyer's felony.

Simply parroting the GOP line that Tuesday's drama has nothing to do with Russian collusion won't ease the pressure.

The Trump camp is already fighting back: "Even if Cohen says Trump told him to break the law, the source says, who's going to believe Cohen now, after admitting to lying?" a source with the Trump Organization said.

Indeed, Cohen's claim is not a legal charge and Trump, like anyone else, is entitled to the presumption of innocence. And it's almost inconceivable a sitting President could be indicted for a crime.

But Democrats now have fresh ammunition to subject the Trump White House to relentless scrutiny should they win back the House of Representatives in November. And the question of possible impeachment will now hang tantalizingly over the election.

Had he lost the Manafort case, Mueller would have been under fierce fire from Trump partisans, with the credibility of his investigation in doubt.

But now he may be emboldened -- as he presses on with an investigation into alleged Russian collusion and presidential obstruction that is moving ever closer to the Oval Office door.

All eyes are on whether he will move against Trump or more of his acolytes before the fall campaign cranks up.

Trump, as he flew home to a White House being pelted by a later summer storm, had much to brood upon, beginning with the fallout of Cohen's courtroom betrayal.

He might contemplate a pardon for Manafort, but political blowback would be immense.

He must worry that his two former associates, seeking to reduce their sentences, will cooperate with Mueller in other areas that could threaten the President himself.

There are no final answers after Tuesday's double courtroom drama.

But the trajectory seems clear: The Trump show is heading down a foreboding road.
__label__politics State Treasurer Mark Gordon clinched the nomination, according to CNN's projection, besting Friess, attorney Harriet Hageman and businessman Sam Galeotos.

Friess' loss caps a harrowing day for the Trump presidency: Michael Cohen, the Trump's longtime former personal attorney and fixer, pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts and implicated Trump in his allocution. Shortly before Cohen's court confession in New York, Paul Manafort, the man who led Trump's presidential campaign for five months, was found guilty of eight financial crimes in Alexandria, Virginia.

Trump did not mention the controversies at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night, but he did brag about his endorsement record -- a number that would be sullied hours later.

"I don't want to brag about it," Trump said, "but man do I have a good record of endorsements."

Gordon will now face Wyoming House of Representatives Minority Leader Mary Throne, who will win the Democratic nomination, CNN projects. Democrats, despite Throne's candidacy, are not expected to win the Wyoming governor's seat, making it likely that the toughest competition the state treasurer will face ended on Tuesday night.

Before he ran for governor, Friess -- who the Wall Street Journal estimates is worth $530 million -- was a reliable Republican donor and bundler. He was the primary backer of former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum's 2012 presidential run and was also a major financial supporter to Trump when he was a candidate.

Friess was slightly favored heading into the primary night, despite his opponents' efforts to cast him as an out-of-state megadonor during the race, alleging that he does not have deep ties to Wyoming and was simply trying to buy the seat by personally funding his campaign. According to the Casper Star-Tribune, Hageman called Friess a "part-time Jackson jetsetter," a reference to swanky Jackson, Wyoming.

Trump waited until the final day of the campaign to endorse Friess.

"To the incredible people of the Great State of Wyoming: Go VOTE TODAY for Foster Friess," he tweeted. "He will be a fantastic Governor! Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment. Loves our Military & our Vets. He has my complete and total Endorsement!"

But Friess, who is close to the Trump family, was also backed by Donald Trump Jr., the President's oldest son and a friend to the Wyoming magnate.

__label__world But in the long, intriguing tale of turtle evolution, turtles didn't always have it all -- shell included. This new species, found in China's Guizhou Province, did possess a toothless beak, another key turtle feature.

The species has been dubbed Eorhynchochelys sinensis, which translates to "dawn beak turtle from China," because it's essentially the first turtle to have a beak.

It had a Frisbee-shaped body with wide ribs, but those ribs didn't contribute to the formation of a shell like in modern turtles.

"This creature was over six feet long, it had a strange disc-like body and a long tail, and the anterior part of its jaws developed into this strange beak," said Olivier Rieppel, study co-author and paleontologist at Chicago's Field Museum, in a statement. "It probably lived in shallow water and dug in the mud for food."

Turtle evolution is complicated and difficult to piece together because their evolutionary track can't be compared to others'.

Other early turtles had a partial shell but no beak. Odontochelys, dating to 220 million years ago, had a protective shell on its underside but no upper shell, called a carapace. Pappochelys, which lived 240 million years ago, had a bony structure over the belly.Modern turtles have both a shell and a beak, but their evolution is more a zigzag than a straight line.

Eorhynchochelys, found nearly 25 feet beneath the sediments where Odontochelys was found, adds another piece to the puzzle.

The fossil of the newly discovered Eorhynchochelys sinensis.

By developing a beak before other turtles, this early turtle is a prime example of mosaic evolution, in which traits evolve independently and at different times, the researchers said.

Eventually, the genetic mutations for a beak and a shell happened in the same turtle.

"This impressively large fossil is a very exciting discovery, giving us another piece in the puzzle of turtle evolution," said Nick Fraser, a study co-author with National Museums Scotland, in a statement. "It shows that early turtle evolution was not a straightforward, step-by-step accumulation of unique traits but was a much more complex series of events that we are only just beginning to unravel."

But this fossil discovery is filling in more than one gap. Due to their complicated evolution, it's been difficult for researchers to pin down whether turtle ancestors could be included in the same group of reptiles as lizards and snakes, known as diapsids.

Early on, diapsids had two holes on the sides of their skulls. Without this feature, they would be anapsids.

This newly discovered skull shows that the turtle ancestor was a diapsid.

"With Eorhynchochelys's diapsid skull, we know that turtles are not related to the early anapsid reptiles, but are instead related to evolutionarily more advanced diapsid reptiles. This is cemented, the debate is over," Rieppel said. "Eorhynchochelys makes the turtle family tree make sense. Until I saw this fossil, I didn't buy some of its relatives as turtles. Now, I do."
__label__world Johannesburg (CNN) South Africa hit back at Donald Trump on Thursday after the US President criticized the country's land reform policies in an overnight tweet.

__label__politics (CNN) Set aside Michael Cohen's guilty plea and allegation that he coordinated with President Donald Trump to cover up damaging information about alleged affairs with hush money. Set aside the guilty verdict for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in Alexandria, Virginia, at the same time Cohen was entering his plea in New York.

Set aside that there's another Manafort trial looming, or that it's hard to imagine Cohen's allegations don't lead to serious congressional hearings. Those dramas tend to override all others day-to-day, particularly in the national media most closely covering the Trump administration.

But there are also daily reminders, like Tuesday's announcement of a rollback of Obama-era coal pollution rules , that this presidency will leave its mark on many other facets of American life.

There's a lot Trump can do (and is doing) even without the help of Congress, which did pass landmark permanent tax cuts for corporations and temporary ones for individuals, but hasn't been able to execute on other high-profile priorities.

(That tax reform bill, by the way, could very well mean the government has a lot less money to spend, depending on how the US economy fares. And a lot of how Trump changes Washington will have to do with how Congress decides to spend the nation's money).

But in ways big and small, many of them expressly intended to roll back actions of the Obama administration, Trump and his Cabinet are changing things to their liking. Here's a spin around some of the policies (just a sampling, really) Trump's administration has pursued enacting this summer:

Coal

From CNN's Jeremey Diamond and Ellie Kaufman: "The EPA... formally unveiled the details of its new plan to devolve regulation of coal-fired power plants back to the states, one that is expected to give a boost to the coal industry and increase carbon emissions nationwide.... The move would reverse Obama administration efforts to combat climate change and marks the fulfillment of a campaign promise at the heart of his appeal in coal-producing states like West Virginia -- an appeal embodied by Trump's 2016 campaign stops in the coal country of West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, where Trump supporters waved "Trump Digs Coal" signs and where the President-to-be donned a coal-mining helmet." (August 21)

It's also worth reading this sidebar item on data that suggests this specific move by the EPA move will cause an additional 36,000 deaths per year.

Trump greatly prefers coal and has tried to prop that industry up. He dislikes renewable energy like, say, from wind turbines, which he dismisses as windmills that create a " killing field " for birds.

Cars

From CNN's Katie Lobosco and Peter Valdes-Dapena: "The administration wants to freeze a rule mandating that automakers work to make cars substantially more fuel efficient. It called its plan a "50-state fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standard for passenger cars and light trucks." The administration also proposed a withdrawal of California's Clean Air Act preemption waiver. California and about a dozen states that follow its rules account for about a third of all the passenger vehicles sold in the United States. California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, called the proposal "reckless." (August 2)

Trade

Loans for students

From CNN's Katie Lobosco: "Consumer groups blasted Education Secretary Betsy DeVos... over a new rule they say would make it harder for defrauded students to seek debt relief. Currently, students may be eligible for federal loan forgiveness if their college closed or was accused of fraudulent activity. More than 130,000 borrowers have applied since 2015, a majority of whom attended for-profit colleges." (July 26)

Loans for veterans

From CNN's Paolo Chavez: The Trump administration plans to eliminate routine audits of lenders for violations of the Military Lending Act, according to internal agency documents, The New York Times reported on Friday. Mick Mulvaney, the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, plans to terminate the supervisory examinations of lenders, arguing proactive oversight is not laid out in the legislation, according to the report. (August 11)

Fair Housing rules

From the Wall Street Journal's Laura Kusisto: The Trump administration wants to shift the way it enforces an aspect of fair housing around the US, pivoting away from efforts to integrate lower-income housing into wealthier neighborhoods in favor of promoting more housing development overall. ... The Obama administration took steps to encourage the development of low-income housing in high-income neighborhoods. In an interview, HUD Secretary Ben Carson said he plans instead to focus on restrictive zoning codes. Stringent codes have limited home construction, thus driving up prices and making it more difficult for low-income families to afford homes, Mr. Carson said. (August 13)

VA reform

From CNN's Zachary Cohen: An informal council is exerting sweeping influence over the US Department of Veterans Affairs from President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, a former VA official confirmed to CNN, corroborating details first reported... by ProPublica. This group of three, led by Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter, was very open about the fact that they had been "anointed by the President and had his full support to influence policy at the VA" despite never being appointed or installed as formal advisers, the source said.

Illegal immigration

The dominant immigration story from the summer has been the administration's decision to separate children of undocumented from their families at the US border. Repercussions from that decision earlier this year, the decision to reverse course in June and the ongoing process to reunite children with their families has been a serious problem for the administration that has involved every branch of government from the HHS to the DOJ.

Legal immigration

From CNN's Tal Kopan: "White House adviser Stephen Miller is pushing to expedite a policy that could penalize legal immigrants whose families receive public benefits and make it more difficult to get citizenship, three sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. The White House has been reviewing the proposal since March at the Office of Management and Budget, which is the last stop for regulations before they are final. But concerns over potential lawsuits have delayed the final rule, and the draft has undergone numerous revisions, multiple sources say. The crux of the proposal would penalize legal immigrants if they or their family members have used government benefits -- defined widely in previous drafts of the policy. (August 7)

The military

From CNN's Ryan Browne: Vice President Mike Pence called Thursday for the establishment of a Space Force by 2020, while also announcing immediate steps the Department of Defense would take to reform how the military approaches space... In June, President Donald Trump said he was directing "the Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces," during a speech at a meeting of the National Space Council.

The list certainly goes on. The federal government is a vast and creeping enterprise. If I've missed a key summer development, send me a note at zachary.wolf@turner.com or on Twitter @zbyronwolf.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Some days President Trump's Instagram can seem like a Fox News fan account.

Trump's account reposted 85 photos or videos from either Fox News, Fox Business or "Fox & Friends" from May 22 to Aug. 22. That's about 24% of the 358 posts on Trump's account in that time frame.

Many of the Fox posts that Trump's account reposts are graphics of Trump quotes -- either things he said or tweeted -- creating a social media feedback loop. Trump tweets, Fox News turns the tweet into a graphic and that graphic ends up back on a @realDonaldTrump account.

Twitter has long been Trump's social media platform of choice and the one he uses personally. That's reflected in his Instagram account, which frequently posts the text of his tweets. Earlier in his presidency, there was a visual inconsistency in the formatting of these tweet posts. Last August, for example, his account used four different formats in a single week. But today, tweet posts have a similar look, whether White House-made or from Fox News.

Trump's second most reposted news media brand is ABC, which was featured more than half a dozen times in three months.
__label__world (CNN) Vietnam has jailed 12 members of a US-based anti-government organization with roots in the Vietnam War, including two US citizens accused of plotting to bomb an international airport.

Those jailed included Nguyen James Han and Phan Angel, both US citizens. They will be deported from Vietnam after the completion of their 14 year jail terms, the Vietnam News Agency said.

Pope Thrower, a US embassy spokesman in Hanoi, said consular staff will "continue to monitor Mr. Nguyen's welfare, advocate for him, and provide consular services until his release."

"We have no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad," Thrower added. The embassy has not been authorized to speak on behalf of Phan.

While Vietnam routinely jails bloggers, activists and rights lawyers who are critical of the government, Nguyen and Phan's case has shone a light on the continued operation of US-based opposition groups, decades after the end of the Vietnam War and normalization of relations between Hanoi and Washington.

At least two of those groups have been accused of carrying out terrorist activities in Vietnam with the purpose of achieving regime change in the communist nation.

However, details about the groups and the severity of their actions remain unclear, with both the Vietnamese government and the organizations themselves having a vested interest in exaggerating their role and influence.

Nguyen James Han, an American citizen who is a member of California-based Provisional National Government of Vietnam was sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Aspiring government in exile

Both Nguyen and Phan belong to the Provisional National Government of Vietnam (PNGV). The organization was formed in the early 90s by former soldiers and officials from the former US-sponsored South Vietnam, which was defeated by the North in 1975.

The PNGV is headed by self-proclaimed Prime Minister Dao Minh Quan and not recognized as an official government in exile by any other countries.

Vietnamese state media claims that after the group's establishment, Quan and other leaders recruited followers in Vietnamese refugee camps in Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia. "The recruited refugees were later repatriated in order to conduct terror and sabotage activities in Vietnam," according to the Vietnam News Agency.

PNGV's website says it grew out of the New Democracy Movement, which formed in 1985 to demand "free and fair election(s) for Vietnam."

"One of the important goals of the New Vietnamese Democracy is to unify all the hope and desire of the freedom-loving Vietnamese to become a National Resolution to discharge the dictatorship of communist in Vietnam," it says.

The website prominently features letters from various US Presidents and other high-ranking officials which refer to Dao as Prime Minister, most of which appear to be pro forma replies to letters sent by members of the PNGV.

For example, a 2005 letter signed by Melissa Bennett, special assistant to then President George W. Bush, apologizes for a delay in responding to an unspecified invitation from the PNGV, and communicates Bush's "best wishes."

Quan did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the imprisonment of Nguyen and Phan or information about his group's activity in Vietnam.

Alleged terrorists

According to Vietnamese authorities , the PNGV has been active within Vietnam itself since 2015, when the group's leaders in the US "instructed underground units in Vietnam to develop forces and establish 'volunteer delegations,' seek venues to set up bases, and purchase weapons to prepare for spontaneous and terror acts."

Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security claims that last year these efforts expanded to "aiming to terrorize, sabotage and assassinate officials," as well as carrying out attacks on police agencies and an attempted bombing of Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat airport.

The court heard this week that Nguyen and Phan -- the US citizens convicted -- were sent to the country "to develop their force and direct other members in the country to conduct anti-state activities."

These initially involved small scale events such as "distributing leaflets, hacking into radio stations to broadcast information about their organisation, and protesting against Taiwanese steel maker Formosa," but later escalated to "armed terrorist plots."

In sentencing the 12 PNGV members, the court said they had set fire to police stations, planted petrol bombs at Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat airport, and attacked a police station, injuring three people.

Last year, 15 people were jailed for their part in the airport bombing plot, according to Reuters , citing state media reports.

Anti-communist activity

While much of the PNGV's history is unclear, beyond the group's own accounts and limited information provided by the Vietnamese government, it seems to have filled something of a vacuum left by the self-proclaimed Government of Free Vietnam (GFV), which was founded in 1995 but has since disbanded.

An archived version of GFV's website called for dismantling "the suppressing system of Communist dictatorship of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam by a peaceful, democratic, humanity, practical and persistent approach."

Founded by former members of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces, the GFV, like the PNGV, claimed to be the natural successor to that administration, arguing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam formed after the end of the war is illegitimate.

A 2003 report from the US Justice Department describes the GFV as a "dissident group based in California," which reportedly operates "armed groups in bases within Laos and Cambodia along the Vietnam border."

"The group has claimed responsibility for a number of attempted bombings throughout Vietnam," the report said, adding the "Californian basis of the group has led to formal complaints to the US government by the Vietnamese government."

While the US has a long history of funding dissident and armed groups both overseas and at home, leaked State Department cables published by WikiLeaks suggest the GFV was not held in high regard by diplomats in Hanoi.

"On the specific issue of the (GFV's) office in Washington, the Ambassador remarked that opening an office is not illegal and, as far as we could tell, would have virtually no real significance in terms of damaging (Vietnamese) interests," a 2005 cable said

A later cable noted there was evidence GFV members "have plotted and carried out terrorist attacks on Vietnamese diplomatic missions in England, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines."

An immigration lawsuit in 2014 involving a member of GFV gives some insight into how those activities were carried out. In a judgment in favor of Vinh Tan Nguyen, the court recounted how he had served as a "vice commander" of a GFV jungle camp along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border.

Nguyen's brother tried to bomb the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok in early 2001, and he himself was arrested in the Philippines months later while in the planning stages of an attack against the Manila embassy.

While GFV has a long paper trail in leaked state department cables, government reports and lawsuits, PNGV is not mentioned in the WikiLeaks documents, nor was CNN able to find any reference to the group on US government websites.
__label__world (CNN) Australia's Malcolm Turnbull has been ousted as prime minister following a week of chaos in the capital, as the nation watched the ruling Liberal Party tear itself apart over ideological differences.

His replacement is former treasurer Scott Morrison , one of the architects of Australia's tough immigration policy, who is now the country's sixth prime minister in just over a decade.

The main challenger to Turnbull, former home affairs minister and factional conservative Peter Dutton , was defeated by Morrison 45 votes to 40 in a closed door leadership ballot shortly after midday local time, the party's whip Nola Marino announced.

The Minister for the Environment and Energy, Josh Frydenberg, was elected deputy leader.

Australia's incoming Prime Minister Scott Morrison (2nd R) is congratulated by his new deputy Josh Frydenberg (2nd L) after a party meeting in Canberra on August 24.

The events on Friday followed days of speculation and confusion over whether Turnbull could maintain his grip on the premiership in the face of a conservative uprising.

His position was thrown into doubt on Monday as a right wing faction in the party refused to support his climate change policy. Despite backpedaling on the bill, Turnbull found his leadership in crisis by Tuesday.

"There was a determined insurgency from a number of people both in the party room and backed by voices, powerful voices, in the media," Turnbull said on Friday after the news of Morrison's ascension was known.

The former prime minister attempted to delay the ballot as long as possible, imposing demands such as written evidence he had lost the support of his party, but in the end a vote was called for Friday.

Speaking on Friday afternoon, Morrison promised to "bring the Parliament back together." "We're an optimistic, we are a passionate, and we are an ambitious people, full of aspiration for ourselves, our families, and for our great nation," he told reporters.

Party members belonging to the Liberals' conservative faction had called for changes in the government's policies, including greater investment in the country's coal sector as well as policies to lower Australians' electricity bills.

Dutton, a leader in the party's conservative faction, stood against Turnbull for the leadership in a vote on Tuesday, losing 48 votes to 35, and all but guaranteeing a second vote.

But as momentum behind Dutton began to grow, Morrison put his hand up for the leadership too. His win surprised the nation, who'd been anticipating Dutton as its next PM, even as he dealt with questions over his eligibility to sit in parliament.

Morrison's election to the top of the Liberal Party is only the latest succession in a revolving door of leadership changes in the Australian parliament in the past decade.

Since 2007, no Australia prime minister has faced two consecutive elections.

Australia's outgoing Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull leaves his last press conference with his granddaughter Alice in Canberra on August 24.

Turnbull warns of race politics

A self-proclaimed political moderate, Turnbull was always an uncomfortable fit within the right-of-center Liberal Party. He has been a longtime advocate for progressive social policies and action on climate change.

As the vote of no confidence appeared assured, Turnbull announced that he would step down and leave the parliament after the members cast their ballots, potentially costing the government its slender one-seat majority and leading to a by-election for his seat, or even a general election.

As Turnbull thanked his "loyal" colleague Scott Morrison, he issued a warning about attempts to drag Australia to the right.

"We must never allow the politics of race or division or of setting Australians against each other to become part of our political culture," he said.

During his campaigning for the leadership earlier in the week, Dutton had spoken about concerns over immigration numbers in Australia, a common complaint among the Liberal Party's right.

Morrison has not spoken recently about immigration in Australia and it is unknown if he will follow the conservative faction's policy of cutting migration numbers.

Compromise candidate

Morrison was seen as a compromise candidate between Turnbull and Dutton -- a political conservative but electable. Australia must have a federal election by May 2019 at the latest.

A committed Christian and at times controversial figure in Australia, Morrison was an enthusiastic advocate for the country's strict border protection regime during his time as immigration minister.

Morrison's assumption of Australia's top job was welcomed by the conservative Australian Christian Lobby, who in a statement Friday said they hoped he would work to protect religious freedoms.

"Religious freedom must be a priority for the Morrison ministry in light of increasing numbers of Australians who are getting in trouble with the law for living out their faith," the statement said.

Morrison will now have to work hard to regain the trust and enthusiasm of the Australian people after the week's upheaval.

A poll published by ReachTEL on Thursday said only 8.6% of voters wanted to see him as prime minister compared to 38.1% who wanted Turnbull.
__label__world Over the South China Sea (CNN) One by one, the naval aviators and journalists lost contact with the outside world, dropping our cell phones into a large black bag.

For the next eight hours, we would be monitoring and documenting Chinese military buildup in the South China Sea, and those we're watching could use those cell phones to track our journey. The black sack, called a Faraday bag, blocked any signals from getting into or out of those devices.

This was how a CNN crew began a rare trip on August 10 in a US Navy jet over one of the most hotly-contested regions of the planet. Here's a look inside that journey.

At Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, a US Navy P-8A Poseidon gets ready for a mission over the South China Sea on Aug. 10, 2018

The P-8A Poseidon

Our ride awaited us at Kadena Air Base on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. The P-8A Poseidon is the US Navy's newest aircraft for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, as well as reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. It's based on the Boeing 737, the most-popular passenger jet ever, but it can do way more than take you from Boston to Baltimore.

From the outside, the biggest noticeable difference is the windows. The P-8 has one big one on each side of the fuselage, not a whole line like you see on the 737. Cmdr. Chris Purcell, leader of Patrol Squadron Four and the person in charge of this mission, says that's because windows limit a plane's weight-bearing capabilities and the P-8, unlike the 737, has to carry heavy armaments.

Those armaments include Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Mark 54 torpedoes. With the dozens of sonar buoys the Poseidon carries, the plane can track down and sink an enemy submarine all by itself.

The safety briefing

This is done as a walkaround with a naval aviator, not with a flight attendant pointing with two fingers or with a seat-back video. We're shown where our life jackets are -- in a rack toward the rear of the plane -- and rectangular boxes containing the inflatable lift rafts in case the jet has to ditch in the South China Sea.

There are no slides at the exits. Just climb out onto the wing and jump into the ocean, we're told.

Backward seating

Passengers and most of the crew on the P-8 sit facing the back of the plane for takeoff. Seat belts buckle in four ways, two across the lap and two tight shoulder harnesses.

Six of the passenger seats are directly across from the five-person air combat crew about halfway back in the fuselage of the 128-foot-long jet.

The crew's seats unlock and swivel, however. And that's exactly what they do once the pilot gives the OK, turning to their right in unison with military precision to fire up their sensors and video monitors.

Tracking the Chinese navy

The air combat crew -- four men and one woman -- sit at a line of large, flat screen video monitors on the left side of the jet, each with a mouse and joystick. They mouse around their monitors, tracking what looks like hundreds of ships in the waters below.

Commercial vessels are identified by their names. Military vessels pose a bit more of a challenge. Lt. Lauren Callen scans an unidentified blip. Data collected by the Poseidon's computers is analyzed as Callen goes through pull down menus. After a few minutes, she lists the blip as a probable Chinese destroyer, Luyang class.

It's one of several Chinese warships seen on the trip. The Poseidon's cameras and computers can provide visual identification at long distances, spotting one Chinese frigate 40 miles away.

Snack time

A familiar smell begins to fill the cabin, one you've probably often come across in malls and airports -- cinnamon buns!

One of the Navy crew is baking them fresh in the plane's oven, complete with a small tub of the sweet, white glaze. It's enough to draw our attention away from whatever the Chinese navy is up to below.

The buns hit the spot. What's missing is the coffee to go with them. There's only one small brewing pot in the plane's galley, definitely smaller than your standard 12-cup Mr. Coffee at home. "Design failure," one of the crew deadpans.

The crew seems unflustered. They favor Japanese Georgia Coffee in a can, which they've brought in their personal snack packs. Everything from ranch flavored-chips to baby carrots is pulled from plastic bags and small coolers and passed around.

China's man-made islands

As the Poseidon comes into view of Subi Reef, excitement picks up among the five journalists aboard the flight. We scramble for views at the observation window facing the island as the plane circles it.

We'd all seen satellite photos showing how the islands had been built up over the past three years. But it's quite more impressive to see them from 16,500 feet. What China has accomplished is intimidating.

The Poseidon's air combat crew focuses on specific features.

"Here's the SAM (surface-to-air missile) site," Callen says.

Later she tells the rest of the Navy team, "I want eyes on the ships. Let's get a good count." They count 86 vessels in Subi's lagoon.

China's military facilities on manmade islands seem like ghost towns, with hardly any people seen during a US Navy flyover on Aug. 10, 2018.

Where is everybody?

While the Chinese buildup is impressive, you can only imagine how many people it took to pull it off. That's because the bases looks like ghost towns. Hardly a soul can be seen.

As the Navy plane approaches Fiery Cross Reef, its cameras catch a line of about 10 vehicles driving up a runway. The vehicles scatter among the streets on the man-made island as we get closer, at least giving the impression that they are trying to make themselves harder to observe from above.

A taste of home

The Navy crew has been busy in the tiny galley again, this time heating up a few family-sized trays of ravioli and rigatoni with garlic bread on the side.

We eat it from Dixie-brand paper bowls with plastic spoons scooping up the rich, red pasta sauce. It's not something a Hong Kong-based journalist can get easily and reminds me of countless family dinners back in the US.

I'd trade it for just about any airline meal I've ever had, which makes me wonder if the US Navy can do this, why can't US airlines?

A routine day at work

The trip from Okinawa over the South China Sea and back took about eight hours, a standard American work day.

After the plane circles Mischief Reef, the last major man-made island on the trip, it heads north back toward Kadena Air Base.

The air combat crew brings up recordings of what they've seen on their flat screens, going over the details, looking for things they might have missed or will need further analysis when these are turned over to Navy intelligence.

As we taxi to the tarmac at Kadena, other P-8As can be seen, at least one about to leave on or also just returning from a flight.

The sight reinforces what the Navy says: these missions are frequent and they will continue.

The attacker was also killed, police said.

"After the attack, he ran into a house to hide. He left shortly afterward and threatened police before being neutralized," police said.

Authorities have not yet given an indication of motive for the attack. The matter may have been a family dispute, CNN's French affiliate BFM-TV reported.

The two people who were killed were the attacker's mother and sister, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told CNN.

__label__world (CNN) Halogen light bulbs will be banned in Europe on September 1 to encourage consumers to switch over to the more energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) technology.

The ban and switch to energy-efficient lamps -- part of Europe's wide-ranging efforts to limit damage to the environment -- is estimated to bring yearly energy savings equivalent to Portugal's annual electricity consumption.

Phasing out inefficient lamps will "save 15.2 million tons of CO² emissions by 2025," said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, European Commission spokeswoman for climate action and energy.

"This is the equivalent to the emissions generated by around 2 million people per year. This is a significant contribution to the fight against climate change."

LED lightbulbs are far more efficient than their halogen counterparts.

The measure will also reduce oil imports to the European Union by nearly 75 million barrels a year, according to Itkonen.

__label__politics (CNN) A viral video of Democratic Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke discussing protests over racial injustice during the national anthem in the NFL has drawn a wave of praise and commentary from some high-profile athletes, including LeBron James.

James tweeted about the video of O'Rourke from "Now This" news, which credits the footage to Nivien Saleh. As of Thursday morning, the video had more than 12.8 million views and more than 160,000 retweets.

"A Must Watch!!!," James wrote to his 41 million followers. "Salute @BetoORourke for the candid thoughtful words!"

A Must Watch!!! 🙏🏾💪🏾💯‼️ Salute @BetoORourke for the candid thoughtful words! https://t.co/E1YrbqGciZ — LeBron James (@KingJames) August 23, 2018

In the four-minute video, O'Rourke fields a question at a Texas town hall about the national anthem protests that have roiled the NFL over the past year. The El Paso Democrat -- who is challenging incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz in November -- explains why he supports the protests, meant to draw attention to racial injustice, and remarking on the similarities between the sacrifices of soldiers and veterans and those of civil rights activists, and saying "I can think of nothing more American" than peaceful protests.

Cruz responded to the O'Rourke video on Thursday, tweeting: "Most Texans stand for the flag, but Hollywood liberals are so excited that Beto is siding with NFL players protesting the national anthem that Kevin Bacon just retweeted it. That means all of us us can now win Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon!"

__label__world (CNN) Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman imprisoned in Tehran since 2016 on spying charges, has been temporarily released, the Free Nazanin campaign said in a statement Thursday.

The release is initially for three days, the statement said, but Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyer is hopeful this can be extended.

"This was a very happy surprise after a number of false dawns recently, which had been increasingly unsettling," the campaign group said.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe is currently in Damavand, east of Tehran, with her family, including her 4-year-old daughter Gabriella.

"It will be just awesome for Gabriella to have mummy home finally," Zaghari-Ratcliffe said through the campaign group.

"We can play with her dolls house, and she can show me her toys. The thought of brushing her hair, and giving her a bath, of being able to take her to the park, and feed her, and sleep next to her -- it just kills me. It is still so hard to believe."

Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained at Tehran's airport in April 2016 while on her way back to the UK from visiting family with Gabriella, who was then 22 months old.

The Iranian government accused her of working with organizations allegedly attempting to overthrow the regime. She was sentenced to five years in jail and her child was placed in the care of her parents.

Her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, rejected the allegations.

In May, Iranian media reported that she was due to face a new trial for "security-related" charges.

The Thomson Reuters Foundation CEO said she was "delighted" at Zaghari-Ratcliffe's temporary release.

"We see this as a positive sign and hope that this will lead to her permanent release and an end to her traumatic ordeal for good," Monique Villa said in a statement.

Writing on Twitter, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt described Thursday's announcement as "really good news," but called for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's permanent release.

"Being in prison AT ALL is gross injustice and she must be PERMANENTLY released for which every effort will continue," he wrote.

Really good news that Nazanin has been released on furlough, credit to tireless campaigning by husband Richard and her friends. But being in prison AT ALL is gross injustice and she must be PERMANENTLY released for which every effort will continue @FreeNazanin — Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) August 23, 2018

Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has been the driving force behind the Free Nazanin campaign and has been very critical in the past of the UK government's handling of the case.

While acknowledging Thursday that he "may need to be critical again," he thanked Hunt and all those involved in negotiating his wife's temporary release. "Today is a good day," he said.

Richard Ratcliffe holds a "#Free Nazanin" sign and candle during a vigil for his wife outside the Iranian Embassy in London in January 2017.

'A genuine surprise'

Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release is subject to certain conditions, according to the campaign group. She is not allowed to leave the country, visit the grounds of any foreign embassy or conduct interviews with the media.

According to the group, it is standard practice for prisoners in Iran to be released for a short period initially, but for their furlough then to be extended. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyer will request an extension on Saturday, the group said.

Although Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family had been aware of the possibility of temporary release for some time, they had lost hope that it could happen and were surprised to receive a phone call Thursday morning, according to the group. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was given just 10 minutes to get ready to leave Evin prison, the group said.

Earlier this year, she had requested a temporary release to visit Gabriella, whom she had not seen for more than two years and who celebrated her fourth birthday in June. Despite high hopes, her release was not authorized.

"Today was a genuine surprise after all the disappointments," Richard Ratcliffe said. "We have been burned by hope before, so it had been easier to presume disappointment would come again."

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was temporarily reunited with her daughter Gabriella in Iran on Thursday.

Diplomatic rift

Zaghari-Ratcliffe's imprisonment sparked a diplomatic spat between Britain and Iran.

In December last year, then British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited Tehran to try to raise Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with the Iranian government.

The visit came a month after Johnson was forced to apologize for a serious misstep in which he told a UK parliamentary committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism during her visit to Iran. He later clarified that she had been visiting relatives before she was detained.

The comments apparently led to Zaghari-Ratcliffe being summoned to an unscheduled court hearing, at which Johnson's remarks were cited as proof that she had engaged in "propaganda against the regime."
__label__politics (CNN) David Pecker, the head of the company that publishes the National Enquirer, was granted immunity in the federal investigation into President Donald Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in exchange for providing information on hush money deals, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc., told federal prosecutors that Trump had knowledge of Cohen's payments to women who had alleged sexual encounters with him, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Pecker also provided investigators with details about payments Cohen made to the women, the sources said.

Representatives for American Media Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.

Cohen pleaded guilty Tuesday to eight criminal counts, including tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations.

In court Tuesday, Cohen said, "I and the CEO of a media company, at the request of the candidate, worked together" to squelch stories, effectively implicating Trump himself.

__label__politics New York City (CNN) The Democratic National Committee said late Wednesday night that what it had earlier feared was the beginning of a sophisticated attempt to hack into its voter database, was, in fact, an unauthorized "simulated phishing test" and not an actual attempt to hack into its systems by an adversary.

The DNC did not say what entity commissioned or built the test and it's not clear how they determined the hack was actually a phishing test.

Earlier on Wednesday, Bob Lord, the committee's chief security officer, briefed Democratic officials after detecting a fake login page that was designed to look like the access page Democratic Party officials and campaigns across the country use to log into a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the party's voter database, a Democratic source familiar with the briefing told CNN.

The initial detection of the apparent hacking attempt by a cybersecurity firm on Monday prompted the DNC to call the FBI, the source said.

"This attempt is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks," Lord said in a statement released shortly after.

__label__politics (CNN) After one day where truth and facts triumphed, America is back to its alternative realities.

The convictions of two close associates of President Donald Trump in a mind-bending double-header drama in two cities on Tuesday were a moment of clarity in the legal morass that has thickened around the White House over the last 19 months.

Yet anyone who thought that being implicated in a crime in one of the most sensational political moments of recent history would soon temper Trump's behavior, stop his White House peddling untruths or reshape the political terrain that sustains his presidency is being disappointed -- at least for now.

Certainly, in years to come that tumultuous hour on Tuesday could turn out to be the moment when the Trump presidency began to unravel and the Teflon armor that shielded the President from scandals and outrages that would doom normal politicians was finally penetrated.

After all, months of obfuscation and attacks on Robert Mueller could not halt the legal process that's likely to send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the President's former fixer Michael Cohen to jail for years. And the real meat of the special counsel's investigation into alleged collusion with Russia is yet to be revealed.

But in the immediate term at least, it seems nothing has changed in Washington.

The White House is back to peddling narratives that defy fact, attacking the media and lifting talking points from conservative opinion hosts. Trump is making new assaults on legal propriety. Republicans are dodging reporters in the Capitol to avoid being called to account for the President's latest transgression. Democrats, owing to the GOP's power monopoly in Washington, can only stir outrage and fire blanks -- at least until the midterm elections.

'What in the world are we going through?'

Trump's defenders can still argue that although Cohen and Manafort, and the already disgraced Trump acolytes Rick Gates and Michael Flynn , have been felled by Mueller, the President has not been charged or been proved to have colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.

But his attitude on Wednesday hardly fit the profile of someone who had done nothing wrong or who is convinced the legal process should be allowed to play out to its conclusion.

He made up a legal loophole to argue that the hush money paid to women before the 2016 election who alleged they had affairs with him -- payments Cohen said were made at his direction -- did not break the law since it did not come from campaign funds.

"They didn't come out of the campaign and that's big," Trump said in an interview with Fox News. "It's not even a campaign violation."

Trump is also again brazenly tearing at the boundaries of presidential decorum, dangling the possibility of a pardon before Manafort, who might just be tempted to cooperate with Mueller, now that he's probably going to jail for most of the rest of his life.

"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!" Trump tweeted.

Former Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste bemoaned the possibility that the President might be considering a pardon for a man convicted of massive tax fraud and called on political leaders to come together to head off a moment of national peril.

"What in the world are we going through in this country?" Ben-Veniste told CNN's Erica Hill.

At the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders held a previously unscheduled briefing to press home the President's counterattack.

She dismissed the notion that Trump was in legal trouble at all over Cohen's accusation, which effectively boiled down to the sitting President of the United States being accused of a crime.

"As the President has said and we've stated many times, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him and we've commented on it extensively," she said.

When asked by a reporter whether Trump's now-discredited statement on Air Force One that he knew nothing about the payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels, she attacked the messenger:

"I think that's a ridiculous accusation. The President, in this matter, has done nothing wrong."

Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are stuck in their perpetual dance, tiptoeing around Trump's latest misadventures in fear of his Make America Great Again base. House Speaker Paul Ryan, once seen as the moral conscience of the GOP, is nowhere to be seen nor heard.

"I'm not very happy about it," said Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch, who earlier this year said the current presidency could be the greatest in history, but he added Wednesday that Trump should not be blamed for his staff.

Louisiana's Sen. John Kennedy said he didn't see what the fuss was about in the Cohen and Manafort convictions.

"You know, I'm sorry. I don't see any deeper meaning in this other than you have to pay your taxes and you can't lie on a loan application," he told reporters.

South Carolina's Sen. Lindsey Graham, a sometime Trump golf partner, punted.

"Rather than answer a bunch of hypotheticals, I'll do what I did in the Clinton -- when Ken Starr issued his report. I read it, I'll make a decision," he said.

Democrats are gamely repurposing the latest Trump crisis in their almost certainly futile bid to scuttle the President's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, but are limited by their purgatory in the minority.

Hawaii's Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono nixed a meeting with Kavanaugh, to bolster Democratic calls for the nomination to be put on hold given Tuesday's events.

But Democrats are also still wary of using the "I" word, partly to avoid giving Trump a rallying issue that could motivate his supporters in the midterm elections.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told The Associated Press on Wednesday that impeachment is still "not on the table" even though some liberals believe that if Trump did conspire with Cohen in the way it appears from his court testimony, he may have already committed a high crime or misdemeanor that is the standard for House of Representatives action against a President.

A 'reckoning' will come

It's become a cliché that nothing -- insulting war hero Sen. John McCain, cozying up to Russian leader Vladimir Putin or elevating white supremacists -- derails Trump. Tuesday's events could become just another data point in that trend. And if the special counsel finds no evidence of collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, Trump will be able to credibly assert that his name is clear.

But no one knows where Mueller's probe will lead, if Trump or his campaign is guilty of collusion or obstructing justice. Presidencies can take years to unravel, as the varied experiences of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter show.

There's also little doubt that Tuesday's legal stunners, and the news that White House Counsel Donald McGahn testified to Mueller for 30 hours, have seeded new dark clouds around the President that could manifest themselves in ways impossible to predict right now.

And while Democrats are currently powerless, they could cripple Trump's presidency and make his life a misery with incessant investigations if they win the House in November

A Democratic rout would prompt Republicans to consider whether sticking with Trump and a strategy solely reliant on his base is wise in the 2020 election.

So while it may seem that Trump's political and legal luck is holding, it may erode over time and the furor surrounding Tuesday's convictions could be a major reason why.

Some Trump opponents are still optimistic that the President is set for a demise.

"I believe in the wisdom and the good faith of the American people," Norm Eisen, White House ethics czar during the Obama administration, said on CNN International.

"Let's let it unfold. He is going to meet his day of reckoning."
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump maintained the felony counts Michael Cohen admitted to were not actual crimes in an interview aired Thursday.

"What Michael Cohen pled to weren't crimes," Trump told Fox News, suggesting Cohen accepted a plea deal on the campaign finance violations because the other crimes he admitted to were more serious.

"He made a great deal. He was in another business totally unrelated to me where I guess there was fraud involved," Trump said.

"A lot of lawyers on television and lawyers I have say they aren't crimes," Trump said on the campaign finance violations. "He makes a better deal when he uses me."

The President downplayed his relationship with his longtime lawyer.

__label__politics (CNN) Rep. Duncan D. Hunter seemed to shift any blame onto his wife, Margaret, on Thursday for alleged campaign fund abuses, saying she was the one handling his finances.

"She was also the campaign manager, so whatever she did that'll be looked at too, I'm sure," the California Republican said on Fox News.

"But I didn't do it," Hunter said. "I didn't spend any money illegally."

Duncan and Margaret Hunter pleaded not guilty Thursday morning to federal charges that they had stolen a quarter of a million dollars in campaign funds to furnish their lavish lifestyle. The Hunters had been indicted earlier this week, accused of spending the campaign money on expenses including a $14,000 Italian vacation, groceries and other household items.

"My campaign did make mistakes," Hunter said in the Fox interview. "There was money spent on things not by me but by the campaign, and I paid that back before my last election."

__label__politics (CNN) If President Donald Trump were impeached, "the American people would revolt," the President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in an interview with Sky News.

"You'd only impeach him for political reasons, and the American people would revolt against that," Giuliani said Thursday.

When asked about whether Trump was destined for "inevitable" impeachment, Giuliani replied, "Hardly," and went on to say things have, in fact, "turned very much in the President's favor."

"I think it's inevitable that he won't" be impeached, Giuliani said. "President Trump is completely cleared. You have this Cohen guy, he doesn't know anything about Russian collusion, doesn't know anything about obstruction."

Michael Cohen used to serve as Trump's personal lawyer, but has recently found himself in a whirlwind of legal battles.

__label__politics (CNN) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is looking into a plan that would allow states to use federal funding to buy firearms for teachers, The New York Times reported Wednesday.

The Education Department is considering using a an existing grant program that does not specifically disallow the purchase of guns as a way to give funding for the firearms sales to states or school districts, the Times reported, citing multiple people with knowledge of the plan. Because the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Program does not discuss whether firearm sales are prohibited, DeVos would have the discretion to approve grant proposals that intended to use the funding for that purpose, according to the Times.

In response to the Times report, Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told CNN that "the department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety. The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios."

The discussion around arming teachers has been a deeply controversial one. President Donald Trump floated the proposal to arm educators and school staff on multiple occasions in the wake of the deadly school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February 2018.

"If you had a teacher who was adept with the firearm, they could end the attack very quickly," Trump said during a listening session on school safety a week after the shooting.
__label__politics (CNN) The Manhattan District Attorney's Office is considering pursuing criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior company executives in connection to Michael Cohen's payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing two officials with knowledge of the matter.

According to the Times, a state investigation would focus on how the Trump Organization accounted for its reimbursement to Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer, for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels, who said she had an affair with President Donald Trump. Trump has denied the affair.

When he pleaded guilty Tuesday in Manhattan federal court to eight criminal counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud, Cohen admitted he paid Daniels the hush money during the 2016 campaign. Cohen was speaking as he accepted a plea deal that includes jail time.

The officials who spoke to the Times said the DA's office has not yet made a decision on whether to proceed and the review is only in the earliest stages.

The Times reports the Trump Organization recorded the reimbursement to Cohen as a legal expense, but federal prosecutors said Cohen did no legal work in connection with the matter. The payments were for fake legal invoices in connection with a nonexistent retainer agreement, according to the report.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump decried those who testify against former confidants to ease legal troubles, bemoaning the practice in an interview aired Thursday.

"It's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal," Trump told Fox News.

"You get 10 years in jail. But if you say bad things about somebody. If you make up stories ...They make up things and now they go from 10 years to they are a national hero," he said, alluding to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations this week that implicated Trump.

Trump said he's witnessed similar scenarios over his decades in public life.

"I know all about flipping, 30, 40 years I have been watching flippers. Everything is wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go," he said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump questioned how he could be impeached when he's made strides improving economic conditions in an interview aired Thursday.

"You know, I guess it says something like high crimes and all -- I don't know how you can impeach somebody who has done a great job," Trump said in response to a question from Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt, who asked if he believes Democrats would try to impeach him if they win back control of Congress.

"If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor," Trump said. "You would see numbers that you wouldn't believe."

Trump said during the interview that he would give himself an "A+" if asked to grade his performance in office so far, citing his successful appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and predicting that Brett Kavanaugh, his next high court pick, will be confirmed as well.

"I give myself an A+. I don't think any President has ever done what I have done," Trump said.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump again lambasted his attorney general as woefully ineffective during an interview aired on Thursday.

"I put in an attorney general who never took control of the Justice Department. Jeff Sessions, never took control of the Justice Department. It's sort of an incredible thing," Trump said on Fox News, bemoaning Sessions' failure to investigate a myriad of perceived injustices against Trump and his campaign.

He pinpointed Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation -- a longtime sore spot for the President -- as an act of deep disloyalty.

"It's a very, very sad day. Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done or he should have told me," he said. "Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in."

Earlier this month, Trump escalated his criticism of the nation's top law enforcement officer when he said in a tweet that Sessions is "scared stiff and Missing in Action."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) One of the jurors from Paul Manafort's trial said on Wednesday that although she "did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty," the evidence was "overwhelming."

"I thought that the public, America, needed to know how close this was, and that the evidence was overwhelming," Paula Duncan said in an interview on Fox News. "I did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty, but he was, and no one's above the law. So it was our obligation to look through all the evidence."

Duncan, who is the first juror to speak publicly, offered a look behind the scenes of the deliberations. She noted that "crazily enough, there were even tears," and detailed some of the jury's conversations with the lone juror who she said was the reason Manafort was not found guilty on all counts.

"We all tried to convince her to look at the paper trail. We laid it out in front of her again and again and she still said that she had a reasonable doubt. And that's the way the jury worked. We didn't want it to be hung, so we tried for an extended period of time to convince her, but in the end she held out and that's why we have 10 counts that did not get a verdict," Duncan said on "Fox News at Night."

Manafort, who served as President Donald Trump's campaign chairman, was found guilty on eight of 18 counts on Tuesday, and is facing up to 80 years in prison. He was found guilty of five tax fraud charges, one charge of hiding foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud.

"Ever since I saw the movie 'Top Gun' when I was in primary school, I have always admired fighter jet pilots," Matsushima told reporters Thursday.

"As the first female (fighter) pilot, I will open the way. I would like work hard to meet people's expectations and show my gratitude to people who have been supporting me. I want to become a full-fledged pilot, no different from men, as soon as possible."

"I hope to be the one to inspire more people to become a pilot," she added.

__label__world (CNN) Australia is set to have a new prime minister, again, with the Liberal Party's Scott Morrison on track to become the country's 30th premier following his victory in a leadership vote on Friday.

Morrison, a notoriously ambitious political chameleon, is deemed by some analysts to be a centrist able to unite the troubled ruling Liberal Party after the ouster of former leader Malcolm Turnbull.

Australian commentators have long wrangled over who the real Scott Morrison is, but the question has become more acute now that he's about to assume the top job.

He is expected to be sworn in as prime minister by the country's governor general at some point in the coming hours and days.

Over the years, Morrison has undergone a transformation from a right-wing evangelical immigration minister to a wonky, staid treasury minister attempting to show his more human side.
__label__world Berlin (CNN) A number of World War II munitions exploded as wildfires took hold in a forest around 40 miles southwest of Berlin, Raimund Engel, wildfire crisis administrator for the state of Brandenburg, told CNN Friday.

Firefighters initially could not enter the affected area because of munitions in the ground that exploded in the heat, Engel said, adding that the leftover ammunition is "scattered across the area" and the total amount of unexploded material is unknown.

The fire in the town of Treuenbrietzen began shortly after noon on Thursday. At least 550 firefighters, police and members of the military were called in to help control the flames, along with three helicopters, Engel said.

Residents in the village of Frohnsdorf were evacuated Thursday as the fires took hold.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Friday that President Donald Trump's latest public attacks on Jeff Sessions make the President appear "weak."

"What I worry about is that, you know, the President is head of the executive branch and he decides who serves in his Cabinet. To continue to criticize the attorney general, I think, makes the President appear weak," Gonzales, who served under President George W. Bush, told CNN's "New Day" on Friday morning.

"If there is, in fact, displeasure in his service, then he has an obligation from my perspective to make a change."

In an interview aired Thursday on Fox News, the President lashed out at Sessions, arguing that the attorney general "never took control" of the Justice Department. Sessions then responded to the criticism in a public statement, saying "While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations."

Trump continued the public criticism on his Twitter account Friday morning, asking the Attorney General to "look into" the White House's political opponents.

__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump is raging at a perceived betrayal by Jeff Sessions — the latest friend turned foe to spurn him as his fortress of loyalty begins to crumble.

A traumatic spell in Washington and the courts has also seen friends turn against Trump, a reality star he ushered into the big time taunting him with secret tapes and news that his White House counsel had huddled for 30 hours with Robert Mueller's team.

Trump woke up Friday fulminating about what he sees as betrayal by Sessions in an extraordinary tweetstorm complaining about the Mueller probe and the attorney general's failure to open investigations into Hillary Clinton and Democrats.

"So unfair Jeff, Double standard," the President tweeted.

The most glaring recent defections came in under-oath accusations in a plea hearing by his former lawyer Michael Cohen that Trump had directed him to make hush payments to female accusers in a bid to avoid damage in the 2016 election. There was also a stunning report Thursday that David Pecker, the CEO of the company that publishes the National Enquirer -- which was once all but a propaganda organ for Trump -- has been granted immunity in the case.

"I know all about flipping, 30, 40 years I have been watching flippers," Trump told "Fox & Friends" in an interview that aired Thursday, before the Pecker news broke, as he reflected on the Cohen episode, which leaves him dangerously exposed. "Everything is wonderful, and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go."

In a new sign of peril for the President, The Associated Press reported that a safe at the Enquirer, known for "catch and kill" deals to stifle celebrity scandals, contained documentation on potentially damaging stories about Trump.

Recent events make clear that some who served Trump no longer fear his contempt, or are putting themselves first when forced to choose between their fidelity to him and their own political and constitutional duties or legal exposure.

That is a worrying proposition for a President who was implicated in a crime this week, who is embroiled in potentially the most serious criminal investigation of a commander in chief in decades and -- if a 1 a.m. tweet from the White House on Thursday lambasting the "Witch Hunt" is any guide -- is increasingly consumed by his own fate.

NO COLLUSION - RIGGED WITCH HUNT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018

Trump has been underestimated many times in ways that have fueled his political rise and stunningly unorthodox presidency, so it's possible he can ride out this rough patch.

But any sense that he's no longer quite the omnipotent operator he was will embolden his enemies and, if the midterm elections go badly, may eventually weigh on the calculations of his GOP protectors in Washington, a town with a feral instinct for weakness.

The cycle of betrayals must be especially galling for a President who craves loyalty and genuflection -- but it's perhaps inevitable given he has often failed to show loyalty to those around him. His fraying protective shield is likely to bind him ever more closely to longtime aides who have yet to blink -- often at considerable cost to their own reputations -- as well as to his blood relatives and adoring political base.

Every President comes to learn the loneliness of ultimate power. But the burden is more acute if he is always wondering who will betray him next.

Loyalty, above all

Trump, a tycoon with a tabloid past, has always had a huge circle of acquaintances but a tight inner circle in which family and trust are paramount.

But it became clear as he transitioned to politics that his need for loyalty -- exemplified by accounts of encounters with the President by fired FBI Director James Comey -- raged within him, and often flowed one way.

His administration has featured awkward televised sessions in which he has required Republican lawmakers or Cabinet secretaries to pledge allegiance.

Subordinates who absorbed bitter criticism to work for him -- like former chief of staff Reince Priebus or ex-press secretary Sean Spicer -- found loyalty in short supply from the President when he tired of them.

No Trump cabinet member has been more poorly treated than Sessions, the first senator to back his campaign.

Trump is disgusted that Sessions disqualified himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, seeing it as a betrayal from someone he believes should be loyal to him rather the traditions of the Justice Department and his constitutional duties.

"He took the job and then he said, 'I'm going to recuse myself' -- I said what kind of a man is this? By the way, he was on the campaign. The only reason I gave him the job, I felt loyalty," Trump told Fox.

Once, Sessions might have kept quiet. But on Thursday he hit back, showing where his loyalties now rest.

"While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations," Sessions said, in a clear swipe at a President who has repeatedly assaulted the integrity and the independence of the Justice Department.

"I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action. However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States," Sessions said.

Trump and Sessions have been on the rocks for months. But the President's relationships with two other former acolytes, Cohen and Omarosa Manigault Newman -- the former "Apprentice" contestant and White House aide -- flamed out more suddenly.

Cohen felt spurned by Trump after an FBI raid earlier this year that led to him pleading guilty to bank and tax fraud and campaign violations on Tuesday.

And in a spectacular display of turning loyalties to royalties, Manigault Newman, who said she became more and more disillusioned with Trump over race issues, published a tell-all book, "Unhinged," and is spilling tapes and videos of her time in the administration.

The President's son Eric made no secret of his contempt for her behavior when he tweeted on Aug. 16: "I truly hate disloyal people." The President lashed out at his former "Apprentice" colleague, calling her a "dog" on Twitter.

I truly hate disloyal people — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) August 17, 2018

Trump : Cohen only a 'part time' partnership

While scorning Cohen, Trump is also minimizing his relationship with him, which -- given the possibility that his former lawyer could cooperate with Mueller -- is now a glaring vulnerability.

"He worked for me, you could say more or less part time," Trump told Fox.

That characterization of their relationship is misleading, said David Cay Johnston, author of "It's Even Worse Than You Think," a book about the Trump administration's impact on America.

"For 10 years, this was the guy who handled the most sensitive things Donald had to hide. That's why he is the lawyer on the (Karen) McDougal and the Stormy Daniels hush money payments," Johnston told CNN's Ana Cabrera.

"Donald knew he could trust him to do his dirty work and to conceal what he really is like from the public."

Trump may also be pondering the loyalties of another insider, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer for decades, who has been subpoenaed to testify in the Cohen case. He might have questions about Donald McGahn, whose 30 hours of testimony in the Mueller probe underlined the fact that he serves as the attorney for the office of the presidency, and not the President in a personal capacity.

Trump must also be wondering what former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates have said since reaching plea deals with Mueller.

The inner circle holds firm

But the President is not completely alone. He has a wide circle of informal acquaintances and spends hours on the phone discussing his political and legal situations.

His daughter Ivanka, son-in-law, Jared, and son Donald Jr. have been staunchly loyal to him. Current and former aides like Corey Lewandowski and Kellyanne Conway often wade into the fire to defend the President on television. Press secretary Sarah Sanders absorbs fearsome flak from the media despite often seeming blindsided by the President's actions and statements. His lawyer Rudy Giuliani has put his own legacy on the line to be by Trump's side.

There's intrigue over first lady Melania Trump, however, who has shown no sign of disloyalty in public but in recent weeks has often seemed to be subtly trolling her husband, with her clothing during a trip to assess the family separations crisis on the southern border and by warning about online bullying this week.

There is also one huge huge exception to the rule of flipping former aides in legal peril: Paul Manafort. So far, despite facing the full force of Mueller's probe, he has refused to take a plea deal. And Trump is trying to keep it that way, repeatedly dangling the possibility of a pardon before his former campaign chairman, who was convicted of bank and tax fraud this week.

"Unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!" Trump tweeted on Wednesday.
__label__politics (CNN) Indicted California Congressman Duncan Hunter (R) offered a glimpse into his legal strategy in an interview with Fox News on Thursday night: Blame his wife for the whole thing.

"She was also the campaign manager, so whatever she did that'll be looked at too, I'm sure," Hunter said of his wife, Margaret. "But I didn't do it. I didn't spend any money illegally."

Ooomph.

The turn to pushing his wife directly under the bus is a change even from 24 hours earlier when Hunter insisted that the 47-page indictment detailing 200 separate instances of the misuse of campaign funds for personal use was nothing more than the "Democrats' arm of law enforcement" (aka the Justice Department) organizing a "witch hunt" (his words) against him just like they did with President Donald Trump

This is what panic looks like when facing down an onrushing federal prosecution that could lead to significant jail time. You'll say or do anything to lessen your legal jeopardy -- up to and including insisting that your wife did it all and you tried to tell her no but she wouldn't listen.

There was some inkling that things were headed this way when Hunter and his wife made their first appearance on the charges in a San Diego courtoom on Thursday. CNN's Maeve Reston wrote of the scene

"The congressman entered the courtroom with his lawyers, but not his wife, around 9:45 a.m. PT in a navy blue suit. Margaret Hunter arrived at court separately with her legal team and entered through a side door. Duncan Hunter and Margaret Hunter sat four seats apart in the courtroom after she entered."

Trouble in paradise!

Hunter's new strategy of putting all the blame on his wife has a major hole in it, however. And that hole is this: He was repeatedly warned about her misuse of the campaign credit card and not only refused to take it from her but also kept her in a job running his campaign.

"Duncan Hunter facilitated the theft of campaign funds by directing his Treasurer to obtain a Campaign credit card for Margaret at a time when she had no official role with the Campaign and received no official salary, knowing that she would spend campaign funds for the Hunters' personal benefit."

"Duncan Hunter installed Margaret Hunter as his paid Campaign Manager despite the protests of his Treasurer and with full knowledge of her long history of misuse of campaign funds, in part because as they discussed the Hunters 'need[ed] the extra money' that would come from her salary."

"Duncan Hunter facilitated the theft of campaign funds by ignoring his campaign staff's multiple warnings about Margaret's improper use of campaign funds, accusing campaign staff of disloyalty by 'trying to create some kind of paper trail on me' when they raised concerns about improper spending, and continually refusing to remove her access to campaign funds."

What's clear in the indictment is that Hunter was repeatedly told about his wife's misuse of campaign funds -- and did nothing (or next to nothing) about it. And, it's not as though the money she was spending was solely for her benefit. Duncan Hunter played a lot of golf, allegedly, using campaign cash. He went on plenty of family vacations -- including one to Italy.

The portrait of the Hunters created in the indictment is not of a rogue wife, refusing to heed her husband's call to change her ways. It's of a couple conspiring to live massively above their means and working very hard to cover their tracks.

Duncan Hunter appears to be trying to paint a very different picture. The problem for him is that the hundreds -- literally -- of instances of alleged law-breaking in the indictment run directly counter to the story he is selling.

__label__world (CNN) Tens of thousands attended an anti-racism concert Monday in Germany's eastern city of Chemnitz, following a week of far-right and anti-fascist protests triggered by the fatal stabbing of a German-Cuban man.

City officials said the "#wirsindmehr" concert, which translates to "there are more of us," drew about 65,000 attendees. It featured some of Germany's most well-known musicians, including the punk band Die Toten Hosen.

"Thousands of people have been moving through the streets of Chemnitz, exploiting a senseless death for their own purposes and hunting people because of their origin or the color of their skin," the organizers wrote in a description of the event. "Racism should not be left uncontested on the street."

The concert, which organizers say is not a "festival or a party" but a chance to "show solidarity with all those who have been attacked by neo-Nazis," was to begin with a one-minute moment of silence in memory of Daniel H., the stabbing victim.

Images showed a large crowd at the concert, with some people waving rainbow flags saying "Peace" and "Love," and several with signs carrying anti-Nazi messages, such as, "No place for Nazis" and "Nazis, you shall not pass."

DNA tests have confirmed that human remains found buried beneath an English car park are those of the country's King Richard III.

British scientists announced Monday they are convinced "beyond reasonable doubt" that a skeleton found during an archaeological dig in Leicester, central England, last August is that of the former king, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.

Mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a Canadian cabinetmaker and direct descendant of Richard III's sister, Anne of York, and a second distant relative, who wishes to remain anonymous.

Experts say other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis, or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and the more than four months of tests since strongly support the DNA findings -- and suggest that history's view of the king as a hunchbacked villain may have to be rewritten.

Ibsen said he reacted with "stunned silence" when told the closely-guarded results. "I never thought I'd be a match, and certainly not that it would be so close, but the results look like a carbon copy," he told reporters.

The skeleton was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city's Greyfriars friary. After centuries of demolition and rebuilding work, the grave's exact location had been lost to history, and there were even reports that the defeated monarch's body had been dug up and thrown into a nearby river.

The remains will be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, close to the site of his original grave, once the full analysis of the bones is completed.

Richard III's body was found in a roughly-hewn grave, which experts say was too small for the body, forcing it to be squeezed in to an unusual position.

Its feet had been lost at some point in the intervening five centuries, but the rest of the bones were in good condition, which archaeologists and historians say was incredibly lucky, given how close later building work came to them -- brick foundations ran alongside part of the trench, within inches of the body.

What was initially thought to be a barbed arrowhead found among the dead king's vertebrae turned out instead to be a Roman nail, disturbed from an earlier level of excavation.

Archaeologists say their examination of the skeleton shows Richard met a violent death: They found evidence of 10 wounds -- eight to the head and two to the body -- which they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death.

"The skull was in good condition, although fragile, and was able to give us detailed information," said bioarchaeologist Jo Appleby, who led the exhumation of the remains last year.

The king had suffered two severe blows to the head, either of which would have been fatal, according to Appleby. The injuries suggest that he had lost his helmet in the course of his last bloody battle.

Appleby said there were also signs that Richard's corpse was mistreated after his death, with evidence of several "humiliation injuries," which fitted in with historical records of the body being displayed, naked, in Leicester before being laid to rest.

Richard Buckley, the lead archaeologist on the project said the unusual position of the skeleton's arms and hands suggested he may have been buried with his hands tied.

Investigators from the University of Leicester had been examining the remains for months.

Others got their first glimpse of the battle-scarred skull that may have once worn the English crown early Monday when the university released a photograph ahead of its announcement.

Turi King, who carried out the DNA analysis, said it was a "real relief" when the results came through.

"I went really quiet. I was seeing all these matches coming back, thinking, 'That's a match, and that's a match, and that's a match.' At that point I did a little dance around the lab."

King pointed out that "in a generation's time, the DNA match would not have been possible, since both individuals used in the tests are the last of their line," a fact echoed by Ibsen, who told CNN before the results came through that "they caught us just in time."

The initial discovery of the remains provoked much debate in Britain as to what would happen with the body, if it were proven to be that of Richard III, with many calling for a state funeral at Westminster Abbey, and others backing a burial in York Minster, in keeping with the king's heritage as a member of the House of York.

But on Monday those involved in the search said he would be reinterred in Leicester Cathedral, the closest church to the original grave site in a memorial service expected to be held early next year.

Canon Chancellor David Monteith said it was important to remember that as well as being the subject of important historical and scientific research, the skeleton also represented "the mortal remains of a person, an annointed Christian king," and as such should be treated with dignity.

Supporters of the infamous king, including members of the Richard III Society, hope the discovery will now force academics to re-examine history, which they say has been tainted by exaggerations and false claims about Richard III since the Tudor era.

Screenwriter Philippa Langley, who championed the search for several years, told CNN she wanted "the establishment to look again at his story," saying she wanted to uncover the truth about "the real Richard, before the Tudor writers got to him."

"This has been an extraordinary journey of discovery," Langley said. "We came with a dream and today that dream has been realized. This is an historic moment that will rewrite the history books."

The pop star, 36, was then re-arrested and charged in a civilian court. He sat in the dock during proceedings as his lawyers argued he was too weak to stand.

Musician turned politician Robert Kyagulanyi -- commonly known as Bobi Wine -- shakes hands with supporters in a suburb of Kampala on June 30, 2017.

A frail Wine, wearing a Ugandan flag scarf around his neck, was seen walking out of court while being assisted on crutches during a brief adjournment on Thursday morning.

He has been in detention since August 15 and needs urgent medical care, his lawyers argued.

The lawmaker's attorney told CNN last week that his client has been tortured and suffered multiple injuries while in detention.

__label__world (CNN) India's top court may have finally ended a centuries-long, and at times bloody, dispute over the allocation of water from a river to states in South India.

The country's Supreme Court's solution to the age-old problem has turned out to be simple -- a fixed allocation of water for the next 15 years to the states bickering over it, and the creation of an independent body to regulate the release of water from the Cauvery river.

The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, along with the union territory of Puducherry, all claim a share of water from the 475-mile-long Cauvery, which originates in Karnataka and flows into neighboring Tamil Nadu before feeding into the Bay of Bengal. The river basin, meanwhile, extends into Kerala and Puducherry.

The Supreme Court said Karnataka will receive 284.75 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water from the river each month for the next decade and a half — 14.75 TMC more than its previous quota. Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, would get 177.25 TMC, lower than what it used to receive.

Why the court cut Tamil Nadu's allocation

Tamil Nadu's allocation was reduced because of the ground water resources available to the state, while Karnataka's share was increased to ease the strain brought about by a string of droughts. The state's quota was also raised to provide drinking water for its fast-growing capital, Bengaluru — India's original tech hub, home to campuses of many Indian and US tech giants, including Infosys, Microsoft and Google.

Kerala and Puducherry will continue to receive 30 TMC and 7 TMC, in line with earlier settlements.

The court also ordered the creation of an independent board within four weeks to control the allocation of the river's water, saying the Cauvery Management Board will be "entrusted with the function of supervision of the operation of reservoirs and the regulation of water releases".

The decision was welcomed by environmental activists.

"The river should not be the possession of any one state. It is a common public trust. People are the owners and the state is merely a custodian but the states have become dogmatic about their custodianship. They have started using their rights as territorial rights. So, just because Karnataka has won in terms of legality, does not mean this is a time for celebration. It is a time for greater responsibility," Leo Saldanha, a founding trustee of the Bengaluru-based Environment Support Group, told CNN.

"The Supreme Court is reminding us of the constitutional mandate, that we have to take care of our common resources as people and that it should not be divided by the borders of states."

Saldanha also welcomed the court's decision to increase Karnataka's allocation.

"The allocations that have been increased for Bengaluru provide a certain type of elasticity in its growth and political incentive to expand the city. The larger point is that in Karnataka, we should be more responsible in terms of how we use our water for agriculture and urbanization in the Cauvery Basin," said Saldanha.

However, politicians in Tamil Nadu expressed frustration at the court's decision.

Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan said he was "shocked" at the reduction in the supply of water to Tamil Nadu.

"But I think the Supreme Court firmly said that water cannot be owned by any state. That's a consoling factor," he said at a press conference in the state capital, Chennai.

"I think now, instead of letting politicians meddle for their vote hunt, we should see that amity is maintained between the two states and the Tamil farmers should think about conserving whatever water we're getting. The people of Tamil Nadu should work hand in hand to see how we can conserve the water."

MK Stalin, a former mayor of Chennai and deputy chief minister of Tamil Nadu, decried the ruling and said the state has been "betrayed" by the reduction.

A contentious issue

Farmers in both states rely on the Cauvery to irrigate their lands. It is also a vital source of drinking water after the monsoon rains wind down in southern India in September.

The dispute over Cauvery's waters date back to the early 1800s, according to government records. The disagreement has resulted in multiple settlements in the past but none have resolved the issue.

In September 2016, riots broke out on the streets of Bengaluru after a Supreme Court ruling ordered the state to release 15,000 cubic feet of water per second per day (cusecs) from its reservoirs to relieve drought-stricken farmers in Tamil Nadu.

After rumblings of unrest, the Supreme Court reduced the level of water that had to be released to 12,000 cusecs each day until September 30. Violence erupted after the court refused Karnataka's request for a further reduction.

Demonstrators vandalized shops and set fire to more than 100 cars, buses and trucks in Bengaluru.

Thousands of police were deployed in the city in an attempt to regain control, while authorities banned large gatherings and imposed a curfew in several areas.

Two people were killed in the unrest.

2016 wasn't the only time the issue of the Cauvery's water resulted in violence. The long running dispute has triggered other incidents in the past, including the 1991 anti-Tamil riots in Karnataka which resulted in a slew of xenophobic attacks against the state's Tamil population and their homes and businesses.

Ahead of today's verdict, security was ramped up in Bengaluru as well as Chennai. Public bus services were reduced in both cities.

The US Consulate in Chennai also issued an advisory, warning American citizens that demonstrations could take place in light of the verdict.

In recent years, the issue has become heavily politicized, with Tamil Nadu claiming it has not received enough water and blaming its neighbor for holding it in its reservoirs.

__label__politics 80 times Trump talked about Putin

Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump consistently broke from political orthodoxy in his effusive praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

His glowing statements on Putin have become central in stoking the suspicion that he and his campaign were somehow connected to Russian interference in the election.

A CNN KFile review of Trump’s public statements — from the years immediately before his presidential campaign to present — reveal that Trump has contradicted himself over the years about the nature of his relationship with Putin.

Since 2013 — when Trump’s Miss Universe pageant was held in Moscow — Trump has at least nine times claimed to have spoken to, met, or made contact with Putin. But as the 2016 campaign wore on and his statements on Putin began to attract more scrutiny, Trump changed course, denying having ever met the Russian president.

“I never met Putin,” Trump said at a July 2016 news conference. “I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.”
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Justice Department offered a public show of support in court Thursday to a group suing Harvard for what it says is discrimination against Asian-American applicants to the elite university.

A filing in the ongoing Massachusetts case is the Trump administration's most significant entry into the debate over affirmative action and sets up a fight on the diversity policy that could have wide implications for higher education.

"The record evidence demonstrates that Harvard's race-based admissions process significantly disadvantages Asian-American applicants compared to applicants of other racial groups -- including both white applicants and applicants from other racial minority groups," the Justice Department said in court papers Thursday

"The evidence, moreover, shows that Harvard provides no meaningful criteria to cabin its use of race; uses a vague 'personal rating' that harms Asian-American applicants' chances for admission and may be infected with racial bias; engages in unlawful racial balancing; and has never seriously considered race-neutral alternatives in its more than 45 years of using race to make admissions decisions."

Harvard has rejected the assertion that it sets caps on the number of Asian-American students, and admissions officials say they consider all aspects of applicants' backgrounds and their ability to contribute to the academic setting.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Rudy Giuliani is joining President Donald Trump's personal legal team, Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow announced Thursday.

In an interview with CNN, Giuliani said he wants to make clear that his role on the legal team will be "limited."

Giuliani told CNN his focus will be on interfacing with special counsel Robert Mueller in his Russia probe and to help bring everything to a conclusion, saying it "needs a little push."

Mueller is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including any potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.

Giuliani, who spoke to CNN on the phone soon after news broke about his role, was careful to praise Trump's current legal team, but he said that sometimes it helps to bring on a fresh perspective.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's attorney, said Sunday that "truth isn't truth" when explaining that he won't let special counsel Robert Mueller rush Trump into testifying because he doesn't want investigators to trap the President into a lie.

"When you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well, that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth," Giuliani told NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday morning during "Meet the Press."

"Truth is truth," Todd said in response.

"No, no, it isn't truth," Giuliani said. "Truth isn't truth. The President of the United States says, "I didn't ..."

"Truth isn't truth?" Todd interjected. "Mr. Mayor, do you realize, what ... I think this is going to become a bad meme."

__label__world Kabul (CNN) Faced with a resurgent ISIS threat and emboldened by recent gains on the battlefield, two senior Taliban field commanders suggested they are open to peace talks with the Afghan government after 17 years of war.

The highly unusual conciliatory words come as Pentagon officials and new US leadership in Afghanistan also focus on seeking peace with the Taliban, switching their military efforts to destroying ISIS' Afghan franchise , the so-called Islamic State in Khorasan (ISIS-K).

ISIS-K is seen as the most dangerous potential threat to US and other Western security evolving in Afghanistan.

US defense department officials said that while the Taliban continued to be a source of instability, it was unlikely to pose any kind of international danger.

"It's ISIS and al Qaeda we should be going after," said one US officer, who did not want to be named.

There is a strong view in the US' defense and intelligence departments that its forces should not pull out of Afghanistan until the threat from ISIS has been eliminated -- and a fear that the entire Afghan operation, involving about 15,000 US troops and costing an estimated $45 billion this year, risked being shut down on a whim by the Trump administration.

"We're one tweet away from Trump saying, 'That's it -- it's over,' and that would be very dangerous for the US. It could bring the world a terrorist superstate," said one senior US officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.

This uncertainty has created anxiety over the US' involvement in Afghanistan as it approaches 17 full years of war, as civilian deaths are at the highest level since the United Nations started keeping records 10 years ago, and as the Taliban appears to be dominating the battlefield with a string of short-term successes, including almost overrunning Ghazni, roughly 130 kilometers south of the capital Kabul.

Some comfort for the US and its Afghan government ally can be derived from a growing split within the ranks of the Taliban. An unusual agreement between the Taliban and coalition is that ISIS-K is the greatest, and shared, enemy.

In response to questions from CNN, Taliban commanders in Herat, northwestern Afghanistan, said they would fight to rid the country of all foreign influences but that fighting among Afghans was fruitless.

"Peace negotiations should be among Afghans and by Afghans. We should not wait for Pakistan, Iran, Russia or America to bring peace in Afghanistan. We have lost many young Afghans. We have orphans, we have widows -- if people from government die they are Afghans. If Taliban die they are Afghans," said Mullah Sher Agha, one of the commanders.

His comrade, Mullah Abdallah Khan, signaled a similar openness to the idea of talks, saying: "Fighting doesn't have any result except destroying both sides."

They both answer to Mullah Mohammed Rasool, who split with the Talibs of eastern Afghanistan because, his supporters said, they get support from foreign countries like Pakistan.

Taliban factions control a relatively small percentage of Afghanistan, according to US Special Inspector General for Reconstruction. About 56% of the country is under government control but a third is "contested."

Those figures relate to the situation at the end of last year, and the scale of Taliban successes means that contested areas are likely to have expanded.

This may explain why Taliban leaders on the battlefield are feeling confident enough to raise peace talks.

Talks are seen as a strategic necessity by many US commanders who no longer stick to the argument that the Taliban can be defeated militarily.

"You don't need to keep killing your fellow Afghans. You don't need to keep killing your fellow Muslims. The time for peace is now," said the outgoing US commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, General John "Mick" Nicholson, to the Taliban in a valedictory speech in Kabul on Sunday.

"The entire world is encouraging you to accept the offer of a ceasefire and enter into peace talks. Most importantly, the Afghan people are asking you to settle your differences peacefully. Whose voice is more important? The outsiders who are encouraging you to fight? Or the voice of your own people, who are encouraging you to peace?"

Back-channel efforts made by, among others, the US and Russia, to bring the Taliban and the Afghan government to the negotiating table have been going on for months.

These efforts will get a fillip from support among the battlefield commanders who now believe that ISIS-K is the top priority.

"Our enemy is first ISIS, then the government," Khan said.

He will draw some satisfaction, then, from the US confirmation that a senior ISIS-K leader, Abu Sayed Orakzai, and 10 of his followers were killed in an American airstrike 10 days ago.
__label__politics Atlanta (CNN) Americans born into poverty are more likely than ever before to stay that way, according to a United Nations report on poverty and inequality in the US.

"The United States, one of the world's richest nations and the "land of opportunity," is fast becoming a champion of inequality," the report concluded.

The Trump administration has slammed the UN report, arguing the organization should instead focus on poverty in the third world.

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said, "It is patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America."

The report, presented Thursday in Geneva, comes two days after Haley announced the US would withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council.

Haley's comment was in response to a letter from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and 18 other politicians calling on the US to "take action to reduce shameful levels of poverty across the country."

They agreed with the report's conclusion that the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion in tax cuts "overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and worsened inequality."

Philip Alston, a New York University law and human rights professor, led a UN study traveling across US. The group went to Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. Alabama, California, Georgia, West Virginia were among the states they visited.

"Most Americans don't care about it. They have bought the line peddled by conservative groups that poor people deserve what they are getting," Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told CNN.

The report notes that the US has highest child mortality rate of 20 rich countries (OPEC comparison). It also has among the highest child poverty rates in the developed world, at 21%. It also considered obesity rates, income inequality and incarceration rates.

Haley said the UN special rapporteur had "categorically misstated" the progress America had made reducing poverty, but she gave no examples.

Who are America's working poor?

More than 40 million Americans live in poverty, according to the US census.

Maudine Fall has spent her life working minimum wage jobs. At 56 years old, she became homeless. Although she continues cleaning and catering, she rarely gets more than 30 hours of work a week.

Occasionally, she stays in shelters, some nights she sleeps on the street. The worst part she says; you can never let your guard down.

"I worry about the danger, you put yourself in a vulnerable position when you're out here," she says.

"You're struggling, day by day. Even working," Maudine Fall says.

Fall says it's impossible to save money for a rental deposit.

"You're never able to save, you're never able to really just build up and have a big deposit to put down. You're struggling, day by day. Even working," she says.

If you are among the working poor living pay check to pay check, one illness or natural disaster can put you on the street.

John Bobbit is one such man.

He used to own a maintenance business employing four people.

That all changed after Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans in 2005. He lost everything and ended up homeless for almost a decade.

"Pride was my biggest sin because I wouldn't ask people to help me," John Bobbit said.

"Pride was my biggest sin because I wouldn't ask people to help me. I always thought, 'I'm on my own, I've got to do this on my own.' I turned to drugs and alcohol just out of self-pity, and I ended up digging myself into a deeper hole," Bobbit said.

He was at rock bottom when he decided to walk some 500 miles (more than 700kms) from New Orleans to Atlanta to start anew. It took him 32 days.

Safehouse Outreach in downtown Atlanta helped him find work in a major hotel.

"I was in a job program and they started me off at $8.50. It's the most humble I've ever been in my life and I'm 50 years old. I'm used to making $25-30 an hour when I ran my own business."

He was quickly promoted to a manager position but was out of work 18 months later when illness struck.

Respiratory failure, cellulitis and gout meant five weeks in hospital and many more weeks recovering. The hotel could not hold his position.

Bobbit returned to Safehouse Outreach first as a volunteer and then he was hired as the kitchen manager.

Today he's making grilled cheese sandwiches and soup for the hundreds of people who struggle to survive on minimum wage.

"We do a free, hot healthy meal to anybody who walks in the door. That's lunch and dinner. In a given year, we'll see about 4,000 people," said Safehouse Outreach CEO Josh Bray.

The underemployed

The official unemployment rate might be at record lows, but Safehouse Outreach says it's seeing an increase in the number of underemployed.

Nolan English runs the outreach program.

"At least 40% of the people we serve are working, they're holding down two to three jobs, have children, they may be trying to land on someone's couch, some live in abandoned buildings, in their cars, then they come here and they go on shift, they work," he said.

Demetrius Philips and his wife, Shamika Harper, both are minimum wage workers who are homeless.

Demetrius Philips and his wife, Shamika Harper, talk with CNN's Lynda Kinkade.

At 38 years, Philips earns just $8 hour.

"You might work today, might not tomorrow, which puts you in a bind because you're only making $40-50 maybe $60 a day. So pay for a hotel room and buy something to eat, you don't have any more money."

Across the US, people working for tips can often earn as little as $2.13 an hour and have to make up the rest in tips to meet the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

"They're not livable wages, they're little tokens they're throwing, they're crumbs from your table," English said.

The Obama administration pushed to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour in 2014, but Republicans blocked the bill despite overwhelming support for the measure.

What is absolute poverty?

More than 5 million Americans live in third world conditions also known as "absolute poverty," according to the report.

In Lowndes County, Alabama, the report found residents lacked basic sewage systems. Unable to afford a septic tank some people constructed their own homemade sewerage lines using PVC piping.

The UN study also found 19 out of 55 people tested in Alabama had hookworm. It's a disease typically found in developing countries, one that was thought to have been eradicated in the US in the 1980s.

While the issue is not new, the problem is becoming more dire under the Trump administration according to the UN.

It found Trump's policies seem "deliberately designed to remove the basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment and make even basic health care into a privilege to be earned rather than a right of citizenship."

"Contempt for the poor in US drives cruel policies," Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told CNN.

"The Trump administration has brought in massive tax breaks for corporations and the very wealthy, while orchestrating a systematic assault on the welfare system," he said. "The strategy seems to be tailor-made to maximize inequality and to plunge millions of working Americans, and those unable to work, into penury.

Forty-six million Americans depend on food banks, which is 30% above 2007 levels, according to Feeding America

"Even people who are working full time can't afford a decent living. They do need food stamps. They do need the sort of assistance that government can provide, but instead what we see is a constant cut back in all of those benefits by this administration," Alston said.
__label__world (CNN) A video of a man making racist comments while on a beach has prompted widespread outrage and sparked a conversation about racism in South Africa.

In video apparently taken on a beach in an unknown place, the man who was named in South African news reports and on social media as Adam Catzavelos, uses a derogatory term for black people widely known in South Africa as the K-word.

The video has caused widespread outrage since a Twitter user posted it on the platform on Tuesday.

The hashtag #AdamCatzavelos has since been trending as people used Twitter to condemn his comments, with some sharing his personal and work details as well as those of his wife, Kelly Catzavelos, who South African media says works as a merchandising director for sportswear firm Nike in South Africa.

He has deleted his social media pages so he knows what he said was foul. Watch the apology and how he employs black people warra warra warra !!! His name is Adam Catzavelos!!!! From St George's Fine Food. pic.twitter.com/fKB83ZlaUZ

On the #AdamCatzavelos issue: We have the power. Boycott the companies that support his business, write to his kids' school for suspension, his gym for cancellation, his bank where his house is financed. We have to move the action from our thumbs on Twitter to the real world.

Following the outrage, Reuters news agency reports that two Nike stores in Sandton, Johannesburg -- where Catzavelos' family business is located -- have been closed but Nike is yet to comment on whether the closures are connected to Catzavelos.

CNN contacted Nike to confirm the reports but a spokesman declined to comment and requested we email the company instead. A response has not yet been received.

However, according to Sowetan Live, a local media outlet, Nike released a statement on Adam Catzavelos:

"Nike opposes discrimination and has a long-standing commitment to diversity‚ inclusion and respect. We believe in the power of human potential in everyone -- of every race‚ religion‚ nationality‚ gender and sexual orientation."

"We can also confirm that Adam Catzavelos is not a Nike employee‚" the statement said.

According to multiple local media reports, Catzavelos' family has released a statement condemning his actions: "The family of Adam Catzavelos is appalled by the video in question. It is abhorrent and we fully disassociate ourselves from the sentiments expressed. Given the high-profile nature of this development‚ the business has been temporarily closed for the protection of all its staff. We have no further comment at this stage."

The family company, St George's Fine Foods, a sauce/meat marinade manufacturer, has also allegedly fired Catzavelos, according to South Africa Eye Witness News.

Eusebius McKaiser who is a host for Radio 702 in South Africa tweeted out the same family statement.

CNN contacted St George's Fine Foods multiple times but was unable to get a response.

The website and social media pages of the company appear to have been taken down also. Many have also gone to the company's Google Review page to leave reviews criticizing Catzavelos' racist comments.

At least one company, the Baron Group, has said it stopped doing business with the St George's Fine Foods.

Following calls on social media for companies associated with Catzavelos to terminate their relationship with him, Nedbank, a South African bank where Catzavelos once participated in an accelerator program, condemned the racist rant in a Twitter post and also clarified that he is not an employee.

Nedbank and 702 strongly condemn all forms of racism. Adam Catzavelos is not a Nedbank employee. He took part in a Business Accelerator Programme in 2014.

South Africa has a fraught history with racism and apartheid and many say the video stirs up memories of a painful past.

It has also caused much soul-searching online among white South Africans.

Some have turned to Twitter to start a conversation around race and are addressing the complicity of other white South Africans -- who may bear witness to racist conversations but choose to stay silent.

This tweet is an example of what's being discussed on social media: "White South Africans who feel progressive have a duty to stand up and denounce those, relative or not, who use the 'k-word' at dinner or around the braai [a South African barbecue] because we all know this still happens a lot. I am genuinely tired of people like #AdamCatzavelos."

South African Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa tweeted his condemnation of the video, saying that "using K word is absolutely unacceptable & has no place in our society. We must all work together to isolate racists & report these incidences to law enforcement agencies so they can be held accountable."
__label__politics Washington (CNN) The Kansas Republican governor's race between Secretary of State Kris Kobach and incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer remains in a dead heat on Friday, with Kobach clinging to a 0.04 percentage point lead as his office sorts through reports of inaccurate tallies from several counties and begins to add provisional and absentee ballots to the state's results.

Kobach -- Kansas' chief elections officer who is known nationally for his claims of widespread voter fraud and advocacy for restrictive voting laws -- said on Thursday night that he planned to recuse himself from his role overseeing the undecided gubernatorial primary race. Colyer called for Kobach to step aside from earlier Thursday.

The race between Kobach and Colyer for the GOP gubernatorial nomination remains too close to call with more than 311,000 votes tallied and more than 10,000 absentee and provisional ballots left to count.

"It's certainly possible that the result of the race could change," Kobach said at a news conference Thursday.

One discrepancy was with the results in Thomas County, where County Clerk Shelly Harms said Colyer got 522 votes -- not the 422 votes he was listed as having received on the Secretary of State's website.

__label__politics (CNN) White House press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a rare correction Tuesday night after falsely declaring that President Donald Trump has created three times as many jobs for African-American workers as former President Barack Obama did during his two terms in office.

"Correction from today's briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn't. I'm sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African Americans created under President Trump," Sanders wrote in a tweet.

During the briefing, as she sought to defend the President's record on race, Sanders said Trump has already tripled Obama's record over eight years for creating jobs for black workers.

"This President since he took office, in the year and a half that he's been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans," Sanders said from the White House podium. "That's 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren't working when this President took place. When President Obama left, after eight years in office, he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans."

But that's not even close to true, according to Labor Department figures.

__label__world (CNN) Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro survived an apparent assassination attempt Saturday after several drones armed with explosives flew toward him during a speech at a military parade.

Live footage of the event showed him suddenly looking up startled mid-speech, while beside him his wife, Cilia Flores, winces after a loud bang.

Dozens of soldiers are also seen scattering during the event to commemorate the 81st anniversary of the Venezuelan national guard in the capital of Caracas.

Seven members of the national guard were hurt during the attack, which the president blamed on far-right elements and Colombia's outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos.

A Colombian presidential source told CNN that Maduro's accusations were "baseless."

"I'm alive and victorious," Maduro said in a national television address hours after what he described as an assassination attempt.

The president added that there were two explosions, seconds apart, and that he initially thought they were fireworks as part of the military parade.

Venezuela's Minister of Communication, Jorge Rodriguez, said preliminary information showed the explosions came from several "drone-type flying devices" containing explosive charges that detonated in the vicinity of the presidential stage and in some areas of the parade.

A photo posted on Twitter by Freddy Nanez, head of the Venezuelan state run news channel VTV, shows bodyguards shielding Maduro following the explosions.

Investigation underway

Venezuela's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, told CNN he had ordered an investigation into the incident, assigning three prosecutors to the investigation.

Saab was close to the president during the event, and says the drone responsible for filming the event exploded. He added that a second explosion followed.

During his speech to the nation following the incident, Maduro said the investigation started immediately and that some of those involved in the attack had already been captured and charged, although he did not specify the charges against them.

Speaking in front of members of the military and other government officials, Maduro also said that authorities were able to obtain evidence of the attack and said the investigation was in an advanced stage.

He blamed the Venezuelan political far right in collaboration with the Colombian far right, and the current Colombian President Santos of being behind the assassination attack.

He also blamed Venezuelans living in the US.

"The preliminary investigation indicates that many of those responsible for the attack, the financiers and planners, live in the United States in the state of Florida," Maduro said.

"I hope the Trump administration is willing to fight terrorist groups that commit attacks in peaceful countries in our continent, in this case Venezuela."

The Venezuelan government has long blamed Colombia for plotting overthrows and, and far-right elements in Bogota and Miami for attempting to undercut Maduro. Ivan Duque takes over as the Colombian President next week.

A Colombian presidential source told CNN that Maduro's accusations were "baseless," adding Santos was "dedicated to his granddaughter's Celeste baptism, and not taking down foreign governments."

A senior US State Department official traveling with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Indonesia said the US "had heard the reports," and was following closely.

How the remarkable attack unfolded

The military parade took over most of the Avenida Bolivar, one of the main thoroughfares in Caracas, and the president's speech came toward the end of the event.

Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, look up during the speech.

Video broadcast live on Venezuelan state-run news channel, VTV, showed Maduro talking about an economic recovery, when the audio cuts mid sentence.

Cilia Flores, Maduro's wife, was standing next to him. She looks up and winces.

The crowd at the parade in Caracas disperses after what officials called an attack on the President.

Shortly after, VTV shows video of soldiers and National Guardsman scattering along the avenue.

Manuel Berbín lives nearby and told CNN en Español that he and his wife thought the first explosion were fireworks.

"We heard the first explosion, and we were there thinking that it could have been a firework that exploded close to our apartment" he said. "Then we heard the second explosion, that was very strong. We went to the window, and at that time we saw the soldiers start to run, they started to move the cars quickly, the sirens started going."

Berbin says he saw smoke rising from the area shortly after.

He adds the explosions were very close to each other.
__label__politics Washington (CNN) Mick Mulvaney, a top Trump administration official, warned behind closed doors on Saturday that Republican candidates such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be at risk of losing and were not "likable" enough, The New York Times reported.

Mulvaney made his comments, according to the Times, at a meeting with party donors alongside Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. The Times said a person at the private event provided the paper with an audio recording of Mulvaney's remarks.

"There's a very real possibility we will win a race for Senate in Florida and lose a race in Texas for Senate, O.K.?" Mulvaney said, according to the Times. "I don't think it's likely, but it's a possibility. How likable is a candidate? That still counts."

Cruz is facing Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his bid for re-election this November, and in Florida, GOP Gov. Rick Scott is mounting a challenge to unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. An August NBC News/Marist poll in Texas gave Cruz a slight lead, and one in Florida from Quinnipiac University this week showed the race there was deadlocked.

Despite his remark about Cruz, Mulvaney was somewhat bullish about his party's chances overall and referred to the Democratic effort as "a movement of hate."

__label__politics Washington (CNN) "Your honor, meet the respondent," immigration attorney Lenni Benson said as she introduced the crying toddler in her arms to the judge that would be hearing the child's case.

Benson remembers the incident well. The child was at court with her grandmother, and Benson tried to comfort the crying girl to help the court.

"The judge was so frazzled by the crying and said, 'Can someone please take this kid out of my court?'" at which point Benson informed the judge that the child was actually one of her cases.

"She couldn't believe it," Benson recounted.

All across America, migrant children appear before immigration judges to fight for permission stay in the country. Historically, closer to one in three had lawyers , according to data maintained by a clearinghouse at Syracuse University. But recently released Justice Department data says the first two quarters of this fiscal year, 79% of kids with cases at least a year old were represented

It's a byzantine process to navigate, even for experienced attorneys like the ones Benson works with at the Safe Passage Project in New York, which she founded to help kids in immigration proceedings. And it's a system that has existed for decades, across administrations and Congresses that have sputtered rather than improve the system.

Benson described it as a complicated version of the board game "Life" -- but one that has life or death consequences for some of the children playing it.

The issue is gaining new attention as the Trump administration has separated thousands of children from their parents at the border as part of its "zero-tolerance" border policy -- thus ensuring those childrens' immigration cases are separated from their parents', as well.

Most of the children in the system are closer to their teens, but there is no minimum age. Toddlers and infants do, in fact, appear before judges in the system to defend themselves against deportation.

"Yeah, I get that reaction a lot," said Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, when asked how she would respond to someone incredulous at the idea of a toddler representing themselves in court. "And with good reason, because it does shock the conscience."

Defenders of the system say the immigration judges are able to help kids navigate the process, and the federal courts have upheld those procedures thus far.

Jack Weil, an assistant chief immigration judge with the Justice Department in charge of immigration judge training, famously testified in a court deposition that someone properly trained could make any child understand what was happening.

"I've taught immigration law literally to three-year-olds and four-year-olds," Weil testified in 2015. "It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of patience. They get it. It's not the most efficient, but it can be done."

He later told The Washington Post his words were "taken out of context," but did not explain how.

In the case of the crying toddler, Benson said, the girl's mother was told by smugglers they'd both have a better chance of staying in the US if they split up, with the little girl crossing the border with another unrelated woman and her grandmother's contact info. When they were apprehended by Border Patrol, the girl was separated from the woman and put into the children's care system run by Health and Human Services. She was eventually released to her grandmother, and the girl's mother decided that's where she'd remain the safest, leaving her and her grandmother to navigate the court process themselves.

But even in more typical cases -- like those of young teens who make the trek to the US themselves, turn themselves into a Border Patrol agent and eventually are released to a relative -- the court process can take years.

When a child is apprehended at the border, they are turned over to HHS and eventually, in about 90% of cases, settled with a relative or family friend. They then are called to appear in immigration court for a "master calendar hearing," the kickoff of their court proceedings.

Many of those children are likely to get a continuance from the judge to allow them time to find a lawyer, apply for asylum or apply for some other visa that protects children. Some, though, may have a hearing date set within a year to resolve their claim.

The process is a maze. For children, by law, asylum applications go to the Department of Homeland Security first, even as the Justice Department-run immigration courts consider whether to deport them. There are other visas, like the Special Immigrant Juvenile visa for neglected or abused children, that can send the kids to DHS and state courts. All while the immigration court continues to weigh whether or not to deport them.

Traditionally, many judges have granted the kids' extensions in court to see their other applications through to completion. The process can take years in some parts of the country where the backlogs are higher.

The Trump administration, though, has started opposing continuances for what they consider outside matters, pushing judges to not grant them.

During one master calendar hearing observed by CNN in Arlington, Virginia, on Thursday, Immigration Judge John M. Bryant in a span of about 45 minutes checked in on the cases of 16 immigrants under the age of 20, all with attorneys and some with parents.

In each case, the attorneys described waiting for applications filed with the government, and all were quickly given court dates into 2019 to come back for another check-in, despite the objections of the government attorney. One child, a boy named José who had just finished ninth grade, was there for his second check-in. His full asylum hearing received a court date of May 11, 2021 -- likely to be just as he is finishing high school in the US.

The youngest was a 6-year-old boy, Rodolfo, who was there with his attorney and his father, though Rodolfo's case was being heard by itself. The judge and Rodolfo made small talk about kindergarten through an interpreter before his case was continued. "Hasta luego," Bryant told Rodolfo, giving him a next court date in May 30 2019.

Experts like Young and Benson have long opposed the idea of children being able to represent themselves. Benson has resources on her group's website designed to help attorneys understand the complex peculiarities of children in immigration court. The manual on asylum -- designed for attorneys -- is 120 pages. The manual on the SIJ visa is 85. Many children may be eligible for both.

"It is a system on paper that looks like it gives opportunity to children to seek protection in the United States, but the reality of that system is daunting even for well-trained lawyers, let alone for the children themselves," Benson said.

Benson described working with kids who got up at 4 am or earlier to catch a bus or a ride to a far away immigration court. She's witnessed confused parents and relatives pleading with a judge to accept their filled-in asylum application, as the judge patiently explains to them they need to send the lengthy questionnaire to a completely different government agency via a post office box in Chicago.

Regardless of age, children in asylum hearings must answer questions like where they are from, why they are afraid to return and state the justification for their claim. Recent moves by Attorney General Jeff Sessions have only set the bar higher for immigrants to justify their asylum claim, placing the burden of proof and legal argument even more squarely on their shoulders.

And the children are not always forthcoming. Benson described an intelligent, "bright-eyed," pig-tailed 8-year-old she worked with, who showed no signs of trauma. After some time, she revealed her mother's boyfriend had been assaulting her before she moved to her aunt's home. Her aunt had no idea. The girl qualified for a visa a few years later.

Young described witnessing a 5-year-old in Baltimore Immigration Court with no lawyer.

"She was clutching a doll, she couldn't see over the microphone at the respondent's table, and she couldn't answer the questions, she was afraid," Young said. "As she was done, (the judge) asked in Spanish what the name of her doll was, and she answered 'baby, baby doll' in Spanish. And that was it."

The case had a happy ending -- the judge pointed the girl to Young's colleagues and she received a visa two years later.

"I asked my attorney what it was like to work with her and she said, 'Well, it took a lot of candy and a lot of Play-Doh,'" Young said.

As more children flood the system as a result of the administration's family separations, Young fears what could result. She is especially concerned about the administration's push to repeal laws designed to protect children -- "as imperfect as they are" -- over what officials say are the "loopholes" they create in the system that attract immigrants to come into the US illegally.

"I fear that one of the insidious agenda items here is for the administration to jettison the protections ... all the policies and procedures we built up over the years to protect the children in the system," Young said. "We were starting to get there and then under this administration -- a system that has taken us 30 years to build, it's taken them three months to tear down."
__label__politics Good morning



Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.



The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.



This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.



What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?



I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.



Best

__label__politics (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency will allow states to set their own emission standards for coal-fueled power plants, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Critics say the decision will result in much more carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere.

The Journal reported that acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler signed a proposal that calls for states to regulate emissions from power plants, undoing a move from President Barack Obama that made those emissions regulated by the federal government for the first time.

"The entire Obama administration plan was centered around doing away with coal," Wheeler told the Journal in an interview.

Wheeler is expected to formally announce the decision in a news call with reporters Tuesday morning.

The proposal is projected to release 12 times the amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere compared with Obama's Clean Power Plan, according to The Washington Post

President Donald Trump could speak about the plan publicly Tuesday at a rally in West Virginia, according to officials who spoke to The Washington Post and The New York Times

The new proposal contradicts the Clean Power Plan, introduced in 2015. Obama's plan required states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. This rule was the first time emissions had been regulated at the federal level.

Obama's plan was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court in 2016 after 29 states and the energy industry sued the administration, arguing it was unconstitutional and outside of the federal government's power to regulate.

This new proposal is the latest move in the Trump administration's continued effort to reverse what Trump dubbed his predecessor's "war on coal." Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt initially announced that his agency planned to withdraw and review the Obama Clean Power Plan in October 2017.

"We are going to put our coal miners back to work," Trump said at a March 2017 event in Kentucky. "They have not been treated well, but they're going to be treated well now."

"By removing and replacing it with a rule that will actually increase emissions, this is removing the biggest action that Obama took to combat climate change," Conrad Schneider, advocacy director of the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, told CNN.

The EPA did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the proposal.

A new plan

In a 300-page impact analysis of the new proposal, the EPA found the plan would make only minor reductions to the emissions of substances like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the Post reported.

By 2030, the new proposal will cut CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 0.7% to 1.5%. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide would be cut from 1% to 2% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels, according to administration officials who spoke to the Post.

"The rule very likely would increase emissions relative to the Clean Power Plan, and it may increase emissions relative to business as usual," Schneider said.

After the proposal is introduced, there will be a 60-day comment period. The proposal gives each state up to three years to develop its own emission reduction plan. Then the EPA has a year to determine whether the state's plan meets agency guidelines. If it does not, the EPA has another year to impose a federal plan on that state, the Post reported.

The policy change is the second in less than a month aimed at rolling back Obama-era emissions regulations. At the beginning of August, the administration proposed freezing a rule that required automakers to make cars substantially more fuel efficient.

Electricity production, which includes the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, made up 28 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2016, which is the most recent publicly available data from the EPA.

The World Meteorological Organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and NASA found that 2016 was the warmest year on record, and the third consecutive year to rank hotter than all previous years.

"We are wasting time when we need to be reducing emissions," Schneider said.
__label__politics Story highlights McCain's office confirms he made an official trip to Syria

He wants more aggressive intervention from the US

Washington (CNN) Sen. John McCain made a trip to Syria last week, his office confirmed to CNN Wednesday.

Julie Tarallo, a spokeswoman for McCain, said he made the official but unannounced visit to northern Syria as the campaign to take ISIS' de facto capital in Raqqa unfolds.

"Senator McCain traveled to northern Syria last week to visit US forces deployed there and to discuss the counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing operations to retake Raqqa," Tarallo said, using another term for the terror group.

Calling the visit an opportunity "to assess dynamic conditions on the ground" there, his office praised President Donald Trump for requesting a review of the US strategy to defeat ISIS.

McCain has argued for more aggressive military involvement in the Syrian Civil War.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday that while "everyone thinks" he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in the warming of relations with North Korea, the only prize he wants is a victory for the world.

Trump was asked by a reporter while holding a Cabinet meeting at the White House whether he deserved the honor, to which the President replied with a large smile: "Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it."

Trump instead said he's focused on getting an agreement with North Korea "finished."

"The prize I want is victory for the world. Not for even here -- I want victory for the world 'cause that's what we're talking about. So that's the only prize I want," Trump said in the Cabinet room.

The Nobel Peace Prize is one of six awards given yearly by the Nobel Committee. Nobel prizes are usually announced in October but awarded annually on December 10, the anniversary of death of Alfred Nobel, who gives his name to the awards.

__label__politics 80 times Trump talked about Putin

Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump consistently broke from political orthodoxy in his effusive praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

His glowing statements on Putin have become central in stoking the suspicion that he and his campaign were somehow connected to Russian interference in the election.

A CNN KFile review of Trump’s public statements — from the years immediately before his presidential campaign to present — reveal that Trump has contradicted himself over the years about the nature of his relationship with Putin.

Since 2013 — when Trump’s Miss Universe pageant was held in Moscow — Trump has at least nine times claimed to have spoken to, met, or made contact with Putin. But as the 2016 campaign wore on and his statements on Putin began to attract more scrutiny, Trump changed course, denying having ever met the Russian president.

“I never met Putin,” Trump said at a July 2016 news conference. “I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.”
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump on Sunday offered his starkest and most direct acknowledgment yet that his son, campaign chairman and son-in-law met with a Russian lawyer to get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.

"This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics -- and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!" Trump tweeted on Sunday

The tweet was not the only time the President has tweeted on the topic, but it does come at a time when the President is increasingly anxious about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and how it may impact him and his family.

Here are three things you need to know about the tweet:

1. A stark -- but not totally new -- acknowledgment

While this was the clearest and most direct acknowledgment by the President about the reason why his son, Donald Trump Jr., accepted the meeting with the Russian lawyer, Trump has made similar statements in the past.

Trump first acknowledged during a July 2017 news conference in Paris that his son was aiming to get dirt on his presidential opponent during the previous summer's meeting at Trump Tower.

"I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research, or even research into your opponent," Trump said. "In the case of Don, he listened."

Days later, he tweeted: "Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don Jr. attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!"

Still, Trump's latest tweet is a stark acknowledgment that his son took a meeting with a Russian lawyer he believed would provide him with "dirt" on Clinton from the Russian government.

And it is also an implicit acknowledgment that the initial statement Trump Jr. released -- and that his father dictated -- was brazenly misleading. It claimed that the primary purpose of the meeting was to discuss adoptions, even though that's not why Trump Jr. took the meeting in the first place.

2. Context is key

What makes Trump's Sunday tweet most significant is the context.

It comes at a time when Trump is increasingly lashing out and seeking to undermine Mueller's investigation. His former campaign chairman Paul Manafort's trial is also underway and getting significant coverage. Additionally, Trump's longtime attorney and former fixer Michael Cohen is said to be prepared to testify that the President knew about the Trump Tower meeting ahead of time, sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Also happening, Trump's lawyers are preparing a new response to Mueller after the special counsel offered to reduce the number of obstruction-related questions Trump would be asked by investigators, sources familiar with the negotiations tell CNN.

But perhaps most significantly, his tweet comes as he is privately increasingly voicing his concern, sources close to the White House told CNN over the weekend , about the legal exposure his son may face as a result of the special counsel's investigation. Trump has repeatedly denied he had any contact with the Russians.

Trump's tweet, in fact, came in response to reports from the Washington Post and CNN asserting just that.

"Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower," Trump wrote in the first part of his tweet on Sunday, rebutting the reports.

3. Trump continues to maintain the meeting was 'totally legal and done all the time in politics'

The President also reiterated on Sunday his assertion that there was nothing improper in his son accepting a meeting with someone he believed to be a Russian government lawyer prepared to deliver him "dirt" on Clinton as part of a Russian campaign to support Trump.

But legal experts have repeatedly said that Trump Jr. could be in legal jeopardy.

It is illegal for campaigns to receive monetary or in-kind donations from foreigners and Trump Jr.'s willingness -- and excitement -- to meet with the Russian lawyer to receive political support from a foreign country could reveal an intent to do just that.

As for the assertion that seeking out opposition research from a foreign country -- let alone an adversary -- is "done all the time in politics," it doesn't hold water. As noted above, receiving an in-kind donation from a foreigner is against federal law.
__label__politics (CNN) Political operative W. Samuel Patten, who was charged Friday with acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainians, has an extensive résumé that includes ties to other individuals caught up in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and work with the controversial political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

Patten, 47, reached a plea deal with the Justice Department. He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the felony charge and has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

Patten's personal website describes him as a "strategic advisor" who has worked in politics on four continents. He has taken on numerous roles for campaigns and organizations over the last two decades, including as Eurasia director for the pro-democracy organization Freedom House in Washington, as well as a consultant for politicians in Ukraine, Georgia, Iraq and Nigeria, among other countries.

In the early to mid-2000s, Patten worked in Moscow for another pro-democracy organization, the International Republican Institute, along with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has been charged by Mueller's office with obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Business records list Patten as an executive of the company Begemot Ventures International with Kilimnik in 2015, which is touted as "a strategic and political advisory firm that helps its clients win elections, strengthen political parties ... and achieve better results" on its website, which does not list any clients.

__label__politics (CNN) Utah US attorney John Huber was revealed Thursday as the person Attorney General Jeff Sessions tasked with looking into Republican claims of FBI misconduct and whether more should have been done to investigate Hillary Clinton's ties to a Russian nuclear agency.

Huber, who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations as a career prosecutor, nearly had his tenure as US attorney cut short last year. In March 2017, shortly after he took charge of the Justice Department, Sessions asked for the resignations of 46 US attorneys who were previous administration holdovers.

Originally appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015, Huber offered his resignation, leaving his fate in the hands of the DOJ.

But President Donald Trump re-nominated Huber in June 2017, and two months later Huber was back at his former post, confirmed by the US Senate for an additional four years.

Last year, former DOJ officials raised concerns over Huber's appearance at a White House press briefing to tout aspects of Trump's immigration agenda -- something that critics argued blurred the lines of the DOJ's independence from the White House, NPR reported at the time.

During a June 28, 2017, press briefing alongside the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Huber spoke on the behalf of the DOJ in support of two bills that sought to enforce harsher penalties for illegal immigrants -- "Kate's Law" and the "No Sanctuaries Act," both of which were passed in the House.

"The reason why we are in support of these is that it adds tools to the toolbox of prosecutors in the Department of Justice to work on the violent crime problem that we have in our country and beat back this blip so it does not become a trend," he told reporters at the White House.

"The tools that were given in these two proposed acts allow us to fight back against drug traffickers and transnational gangs," he said.

Since then, Huber has taken on a leadership role on Sessions' advisory committee of US attorneys that provide counsel to him and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Before becoming Utah's top federal prosecutor, Huber clocked in 13 years as an assistant US attorney with experience handling violent crime and national security cases, according to his official biography

During his first swearing-in ceremony as a US attorney, Huber was described as a "jock with the soul of a geek," a protector for others against bullies, and a man who lived by the motto: "Be the hammer, not the nail," according to The Deseret News
__label__politics (CNN) President Donald Trump has sent a lot of bad tweets. He's tweeted things that aren't true. He's tweeted personal attacks about everyone from Hillary Clinton to Mika Brzezinski and back. He's called North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un "Little Rocket Man." But a tweet he sent Monday morning -- just hours before sitting down with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- has to be the worst.

"Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!," tweeted Trump.

Let's be very, very clear about what Trump's tweet suggests: That the reason the US and Russia have an adversarial relationship is because of the special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

Staggering. Stunning. Surreal.

Remember that the intelligence community -- unanimously! -- has concluded that Russia actively interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina concluded the same earlier this summer. Special counsel Robert Mueller charged a dozen Russians last week for their roles in what the charging document made clear was a broad and deep operation to influence the US presidential election.

Simply put: With the exception of a handful of Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, there is simply no one in a position to know who thinks that a) Russia didn't meddle in the 2016 campaign and b) wasn't trying to help Trump and hurt Clinton.

But wait, there's more! Last week, Dan Coats, the Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence, was blunt in his assessment of Russia's ongoing assault on the United States' infrastructure. "The warning signs are there," Coats said in a speech at the Hudson Institute. "The system is blinking. It is why I believe we are at a critical point. Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack."

And yet, amid all of that -- not to mention Russia's alleged poisoning of Sergei Skripal and its invasion and annexation of Crimea -- the President of the United States saw fit to turn the blame for the bad relationship between the two countries on the US. And specifically on an investigation launched by his Justice Department and run by Mueller, who was appointed head of the FBI by Republican President George W. Bush -- a position he held for a decade. An investigation that has already produced five guilty pleas including from Trump's 2016 deputy campaign chairman and his former national security adviser. An investigation that has revealed a widespread plot by the Russians to meddle in American elections to sway the vote toward candidates they believe are more favorable to them.

All you need to know about Trump's Monday morning tweet is that it was a big hit in Russia. "We agree," tweeted the Russian Foreign Ministry in response to Trump's tweet.

Trump's willful ignorance of the fact -- and yes, I do mean FACT -- that Russia actively interfered in the 2016 election is bad enough. His defense of Putin -- he says he didn't do it ! -- in the face of the unanimous intelligence community conclusion that Russia did, in fact, meddle in our election is even worse. The silence of Republicans who would have crushed a Democrat -- or any other Republican politician -- for saying one tenth of what Trump has said (and tweeted) is appalling.

But none of those things can match what Trump did Monday morning: Blaming America for a problem Russia created. And not just any problem. An attempt to undermine confidence in fair and free elections, a principle that sits at the heart of what has long distinguished the US from Russia and other authoritarian countries.

To see Trump's tweet through a partisan or political lens is to miss the point. At root, what we are talking about is a foreign power engaging in purposeful, strategic and effective cyberwar against the United States. And not just once either -- as Coats' comments last week make clear. This is about defending what makes America great (sound familiar?).

To call into question an attempt to ensure that future elections aren't affected in any way by foreign interference is the opposite of patriotism.
__label__world (CNN) Here's a look at what you need to know about the Camp David Accords.

On September 17, 1978, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and US President Jimmy Carter signed the Camp David Accords in Washington.

Called for a formal peace treaty to be signed between Israel and Egypt , within three months.

Called for establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Called for Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula in stages, to be completed within three years.

Called for further meetings to resolve the Palestinian question. The meeting would include Jordan and a representative of the Palestinian people.

Called for a five-year transitional period of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. This transitional period would include the introduction of Palestinian self-government.

Called for an end to Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

Did not settle the question of East Jerusalem.

__label__politics Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump urged his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to sue certain pharmaceutical companies that have contributed to the opioid crisis in the United States.

"I'd also like to ask you to bring a major lawsuit against the drug companies on opioids," Trump told Sessions during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday. "Some states have done it. But I'd like a lawsuit to be brought against these companies that are really sending opioids at a level that it shouldn't be happening."

The Justice Department has joined state lawsuits against opioid companies that officials believe have helped fuel a national opioid crisis, Sessions said, but Trump said he would like the Justice Department to pursue a separate federal lawsuit against certain drug companies. Trump did not specify which companies he would like the Justice Department to sue.

Sessions said the Justice Department is "looking at various different legal avenues to go after abusive companies."

"You've made clear you want us to sue and use legal process against drug companies that are abusing the law for some time now," Sessions said.

Krill are small crustaceans that are a keystone species in the Antarctic, forming a crucial part of the food web. They are a vital food source for animals including whales, seals and penguins.

They also help sequester carbon from the atmosphere, which can help to mitigate the effects of climate change.

There are huge numbers of krill in Antarctic waters, but some studies show that their numbers have declined in recent decades, which has prompted groups like Greenpeace to campaign for the krill fishing industry to stop operations in sensitive areas.

__label__world (CNN) Brazil is sending troops to its northern border to "guarantee law and order" amid an ongoing crisis which is seeing thousands of Venezuelans attempting to cross into neighboring countries and beyond.

Brazilian President Michel Temer signed a decree Tuesday to deploy the armed forces to the state of Roraima, making the announcement during a speech from Planalto Presidential Palace.

In a series of tweets following the decree, he cited the "terrible living conditions" endured by Venezuelans as reason for the migrant crisis and Brazil's reaction.

"The migratory wave in Roraima is the result of the terrible living conditions to which the Venezuelan people have been subjected," Temer said during the speech.

"This is precisely what has led to this tragic situation, that currently affects almost all of South America."

In a followup tweet he added that the Brazilian government has been offering medical and humanitarian assistance to the migrants, including building shelters.

The Guarantee of Law and Order decree -- where the armed forces are authorized to take on policing duties -- will go into effect from August 29 to September 12.

The northern Brazilian state is the main gateway for Venezuelan immigrants entering Brazil, according to State-run news agency Agencia Brasil.

Along with providing border security, the military contingent will be there to protect migrants from violence initiated by Brazilians angry with the instability created by the influx.

Earlier in August the government announced it would send 120 troops to Roraima, following increased tensions between the state's residents and incoming Venezuelan migrants.

The day before the August 19 announcement, a mob of Brazilians had attacked a group of Venezuelans after a local business owner reported a robbery by a group of migrants from the neighboring country, Agencia Brasil reported.

Around 1,200 Venezuelan migrants fled back over the border after the attack.

Residents of the Brazilian border town of Pacaraima burn tires and belongings of Venezuelans immigrants after attacking their two main makeshift camps, leading them to cross the border back into their home country earlier in August.

A judge had earlier ruled to prohibit the entry of all Venezuelans to the state but the decision was overturned by Brazil's supreme court

This latest decree allows more troops to be deployed to the border, as well as allowing them to operate within Brazil as an internal security force.

'Crisis moment'

Hundreds of Venezuelan people cross into Roraima every day in search of safety, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported earlier this month. Migrants are also flooding across Venezuela's border with Colombia to the west.

The International Organization of Migration (IOM), a related organization of the UN, says the exodus of migrants from Venezuela is reaching a "crisis moment" on par with the Mediterranean flow of refugees from North Africa and the Middle East.

From 2015 to 2017, the agency estimated that the number of Venezuelans living outside the country has more than doubled, from 700,000 to more than 1,600,000.

Venezuela has been engulfed in economic crisis since oil prices plummeted in 2015. The country is one of the world's major producers of oil, and the resource fueled Venezuela's economy under former President Hugo Chavez.

President Nicolas Maduro declared a state of "economic emergency" in early 2016, with issues are rooted in falling oil prices, plummeting currency rates, power struggles within the government, the looming possibility of default and ongoing food shortages.

Recently Caracas issued a new currency in an attempt to bolster its crumbling economy, with Maduro hailing the recovery package as a "revolutionary formula."

Migrant crisis coordination

Brazil's move to strengthen security in Roraima comes as its immigration officials met with counterparts from three other South American countries to coordinate on policies affecting outward migration from the beleaguered country.

Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil held two days of talks in Bogota on the crisis and ways to coordinate the countries' response to the crisis that is spilling over Venezuela's borders.

A statement issued after the talks was devoted to a new agreement between Peru and Colombia to share information on Venezuelans coming into their countries -- many of them try to claim residence in both Peru and Colombia, which is not allowed.

Eduardo Sevilla, the National Superintendent for Migration in Peru said that many Venezuelans who had applied for a Special Permit of Residence in Colombia were then moving to Peru and applying for a Temporary Residence Permit there.

"It is important that Migration Colombia and Migration Peru know how many of them have been opting for both processes, because they are mutually exclusive," Sevilla said.

"You cannot count on a PEP in Colombia and at the same time have a PTP in Peru," he added, referring to the Spanish acronyms for the country's residency permits.

Many Venezuelans are "pursuing different benefits in different countries," denying migration opportunities to other Venezuelans, Colombia's General Director of Migration Christian Kruger said.

"We want to regulate this phenomenon, give people an opportunity, but in an orderly way. There is no country in the world that can handle an unlimited migration."
__label__world (CNN) It was the height of presidential primary season, just a few weeks before the Republican and Democratic conventions, but on July 7, 2016, most Americans woke up to a story other than the election leading the news.

An African American man had been shot and killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb the night before.

He was just one of more than 250 black men killed by police in the United States in 2016 -- most of their stories never made it past the local news. But his name, Philando Castile , would be echoed around the world.

What made Castile's death different from many others? What made his name synonymous with police violence against African Americans? It was Facebook. First, a video streamed through the platform -- and then, trolls using it from thousands of miles away.

Castile had been driving with his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds and her four-year-old daughter when he was pulled over by police. Reynolds had begun streaming the encounter live on Facebook when the officer at their car shot Castile seven times. The last moments of his life would be seen by millions of people around the world.

Soon, across town, Mica Grimm's phone started buzzing. A leader in the Black Lives Matter movement, Grimm began receiving messages: "Look at Facebook. Check Facebook," she recalled recently.

Grimm and other activists quickly made their way to where the shooting had occurred -- later that night they protested outside the governor's mansion in St. Paul. The next morning, as Americans woke up to the news of Castile's death, they also saw pictures of the growing demonstration outside the mansion.

But at the same time, plans for a different protest were being made on Facebook.

Hours after his death, "Don't Shoot" Facebook group started promoting a "Justice for Philando Castile" event

Around 8 a.m. ET on July 7th, less than ten hours after the shooting, a Facebook page began running ads targeted at people living near Minneapolis and promoting an event called "Justice for Philando Castile."

The event was scheduled for the coming weekend and would take place outside the police department where the officer who shot Castile was based. Quickly, thousands of people expressed interest in attending.

But, to Grimm, something didn't feel right.

JUST WATCHED How CNN uncovered a Russian troll op Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How CNN uncovered a Russian troll op 01:32

"So the activists really know each other here," Grimm told CNN. "We've seen each other's faces, and if we don't know each other, then we know someone who knows someone."

No one in the tight-knit community of activists seemed to know who was behind the campaign.

The page, titled "Don't Shoot," looked like one run by a black activist group. It had a significant audience: More than 250,000 Facebook users followed it. It had a website and accounts on YouTube, Instagram and Tumblr.

But Mica thought the name "Don't Shoot" was strange.

Protester in Ferguson, MO in 2014

"When Mike Brown was first killed [in Ferguson in 2014], a lot of people were saying, 'Hands up, don't shoot,'" she explained. But by 2016, she said, many Black Lives Matter activists were no longer using the chant because they felt it was submissive and they wanted to focus on language that they felt was more empowering.

Another local activist, Sam Tyler, also thought there was something unusual about the page. As experienced protest organizers, he and Grimm feared a demonstration with no leadership could descend into chaos.

Tyler began sending messages to the Don't Shoot Facebook page. "Who are you involved with? Who do you have on the ground that's working on setting this up?" he said he asked.

Whoever was behind Don't Shoot responded. They didn't say exactly who they were but they named-dropped some local groups they said were helping out with the protest. But when Tyler checked with those groups, they hadn't heard of Don't Shoot either.

The event continued to spread on Facebook.

Fearing things could get out of hand, Tyler and other activists held a meeting.

"We got together in a basement in south Minneapolis," he told CNN, and they began messaging the page again. By that point they had learned the website associated with the Facebook page was registered to a seemingly false name and address.

"And after talking to them a little bit back and forth and realizing that they were completely making up everything that they had been saying," Tyler explained. "We decided to present them either the ultimatum of either handing us administrative access to the event page or we were going to dissuade people, through a press release, through whatever means we had, of showing up to this event."

It seemed as though Don't Shoot had given in. They handed over control of the Facebook event to the local activists.

Grimm recalled, "Our solution was to take over the event and have our own marshals and have our own leaders, and a lot of other organizations helped us do that. Just to make sure that if people were going to show up, that people weren't putting themselves in a position of danger."

The event went ahead on Sunday, July 10, without incident.

As demonstrations continued, the weeks after Castile's death were a busy time for Tyler and Grimm. Neither gave much more thought to Don't Shoot.

That is, until 15 months later, when they got a call from CNN.

Unraveling

In January 2017, seven months after Castile's death, and two months after the election of Donald Trump, the US intelligence community released a report saying the Russian government had sought to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that they had used social media to do it.

What form the interference on social media took, however, wasn't clear. Some observers speculated that the Russians may have used social media to spread the details of hacked Democratic Party emails or even have run Trump-supporting accounts in an effort to undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.

Both, and more, would turn out to be correct.

In September 2017, CNN uncovered a sham organization called "Blacktivist." The group described itself as a black American activist campaign and had been active on social media for years. It even had a bigger following than the official Black Lives Matter Facebook page.

CNN confirmed Blacktivist was not a real American group, however. It was a troll operation run from 4,000 miles away in St. Petersburg, Russia, by a Kremlin-linked group known as the Internet Research Agency.

The revelations helped to show Russia's use of social media to interfere in American life extended beyond the presidential election, and into efforts to exacerbate existing divisions in the U.S.

A few weeks later, in October 2017, CNN found another group posing as an organization of Black Lives Matter activists -- "Don't Shoot."

As CNN began investigating "Don't Shoot," it found that activists like Grimm and Tyler had expressed some suspicions about the group in online posts a year earlier. They hadn't, however, suspected it was Russian.

When Valerie Castile, Philando's mother, learned about Don't Shoot's Russian roots, she was annoyed her son's death had been used by the campaign.

"We stand by truth and justice. That's what this country was built off of," she said during an interview for a new CNN short documentary, "Distorting the truth: Russian hacking beyond the election."

"God gave him to me, nobody had the right to take him from me. One man should not have that much power to say whether who lives and who dies. No, one man shouldn't have that much power, and then to take such a sad situation and exploit it, no, I don't like that at all and for them to use my baby, no."

Why Black Lives Matter?

Sitting in her home, which is now adorned with portraits of and tributes to Philando that people from across America sent after her son was killed, Valerie Castile had a simple question: Why would the Russians do this?

"I don't understand what they were getting out of doing it," she said. "I'm not politically inclined so I have no idea what the significance of doing something like that really means."

Although Grimm had never suspected the campaign was Russian, she said," It makes sense that they would want to see America have these really deep, intense struggles."

Mica Grimm - Black Lives Matter Activist, Minneapolis

She added, "they're basically taking advantage of what we're trying to do as a country to move forward and using it as a way to manipulate us into civil war. I'm not sure. I mean, that's kind of extreme, but they're definitely trying to use America's race relations against itself."

Grimm's assessment is similar to some of the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In February, his team indicted 13 Russian nationals involved in the Internet Research Agency troll group, saying it had sought to exacerbate existing divisions in American society.

By the time of Castile's death in July 2016, the troll group, operating out of a St Petersburg office, was allegedly a multi-million-dollar effort, with dozens of people working night and day running a network of thousands of fake American social media accounts, posing as activists on everything from Black Lives Matter to Texas secession.

Fake pages created by Russian trolls

By 2016, American prosecutors allege, the Internet Research Agency was "primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton."

According to prosecutors, an internal memo circulated in February 2016 read, "to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump -- we support them)."

Later in 2016, according to the indictment, the group began trying to discourage African Americans from voting.

One post on a fake black activist account highlighted by prosecutors read, "[A] particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL."

The group's creation and promotion of a protest after Castile's death wasn't unusual, congressional investigators and journalists would later find. The troll group even ran elaborate schemes that involved recruiting unwitting Americans. In one case, the group paid for a woman in Florida to dress as Hillary Clinton in a prison outfit and attend a "lock her up" rally.

The group had given control of the Castile protest over to real groups in Minneapolis, essentially turning the real activists into unwitting operatives, helping against their will to stage an event conceived of in Russia.

The group's successful exploitation of American activism shows the perils of campaigning in the digital age.

Facebook, the same platform where Diamond Reynolds would stream the last moments of her boyfriend's life to the world, the same platform real activists would use to organize the response to Castile's death, would also be where a Russian government-linked group would seek to exploit the tragedy.

Some may argue, despite sinister motivations, the Russian group raised awareness of problems in American society that do not get enough attention.

The struggles of American minorities were often highlighted by the Internet Research Agency and continue to be shown by official Kremlin-backed channels like RT, the Russian-run 24-hour news network that broadcasts in the US.

But Valerie Castile isn't convinced, "We don't need Russia," she says.

"We got enough intelligent people, we don't need Russia to intervene, like, 'oh, you're not doing your job, we need to step in and help you.' No, we don't need Russia's help."

__label__world Hong Kong (CNN) The announcement Sunday that China will drop term limits on the presidency clears the way for Xi Jinping to rule the country indefinitely.

However, analysts warned that what initially seems like a demonstration of absolute power could actually be a sign of weakness, with Xi apparently unwilling to allow the rise of a potential political rival.

This could lead to future instability in the world's most populous country as wannabe successors jockey for power within a Communist Party (CCP) completely dominated by the 64-year-old Xi.

And his absolute authority will also leave him vulnerable to absolute blame in the instance of an economic shock or foreign policy crisis.

The latter could be increasingly likely, as Xi's rule so far has been characterized by a more bullish military and diplomatic policy as China seeks to move into a power vacuum left in Asia by a retreating Washington

Factional politics

Following Mao Zedong's death in 1976-- in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, during which tens of thousands of people were killed and the country was racked by civil war -- his successors moved away from one-man rule towards a consensus system where power was shared by a handful of high-ranking Party officials.

This resulted in relatively straightforward transition of power from Presidents Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping, after each served two five-year terms in office.

Early in Xi's first term however, it became apparent he would seek to buck this trend. He was declared " core leader " of the Party, and state media began building up his public image with the type of hagiography not seen since Mao.

This culminated with "Xi Jinping Thought" being added to the Party constitution last year, at a key meeting in which Xi failed to nominate an obvious successor, fueling speculation he would stay on as leader past 2023.

The plan to drop presidential term limits was announced this week, and is due to go before China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, next month, where it is guaranteed to be approved.

Margaret Lewis, a law professor and expert on China's constitution at Seton Hall University, said under Xi "what we've seen is an increasing lack of sharing of power even among the top leadership."

"Xi's modus operandi is consolidation of power," she said.

That could pose a problem to him in the long run. While Chinese politics is not remotely democratic in the traditional sense, there are certain checks and balances within the Party system itself, with reformers and conservatives seeing their power and influence waxing and waning over time.

Jon Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham, said Xi remaining as President and head of state, "negates the institutionalization of power transitions that have served the Party well for 35 years, enabling it to avoid damaging schisms that have plagued other Communist regimes."

While many internal CCP matters happen in a black box , most experts agree that there are factions within the party -- such as the so-called "Shanghai clique" around former President Jiang Zemin. Some have argued Xi's far-reaching anti-graft campaign is itself a tool to go after factional enemies and potential rivals.

That anti-corruption campaign will also get a boost with upcoming constitutional changes due to create a National Supervision Commission (NSC) with sweeping new enforcement powers, potentially affecting a much greater swath of China's population.

Message to enemies

Richard McGregor, author of "The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers," wrote after Sunday's announcement that it "sends a warning to his legion of enemies at the top of the party who have been hit by the anti-corruption campaign: he is not going anywhere."

"Xi's ability to push this decision through in the short-term is undoubtedly a display of his grip on all levers of power," McGregor wrote. "But the very fact that he feels the need to do so could easily be a sign of something else -- that he is possessed by an urgency to gather even more power than he already has to keep his enemies at bay."

This could result in increased pushback from within the Party, as those who had hoped to weather the Xi storm now have no option but to fight against him out of self-preservation.

According to Sullivan, term limits not only restrict the power of individual leaders, they give other elites and factions the consolation that there would be an opportunity to change the status quo after two terms.

"That 'consolation' is an important pressure valve that prevents crippling inner party battles. By getting rid of it, Xi is banking on being able to contain and neutralize his opponents," said Sullivan.

But doing so, Sullivan added, "will necessitate greater levels of repression, both in society and within the Party-state."

Repression and tyranny

Some of that repression was on show in the immediate aftermath of the announcement, when a flurry of discussion and criticism on Chinese social media was swiftly censored and controlled.

Comments on posts by state broadcaster CCTV announcing the news were deleted, as were those on the People's Daily newspaper and Xinhua news agency, and searches for key terms were blocked.

According to watchdog service FreeWeibo , top searches ahead of the blocking including "ascension to the throne," "term limits" and "Winnie the Pooh," a reference to the cartoon character which has become a mocking symbol of Xi on the Chinese internet

Results for some of those topics on Weibo itself appeared to be being actively filtered, while others returned the message "search results are not shown in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies."

One term being completely censored was "Yuan Shikai," the former President of the Republic of China who dissolved a democratically-elected parliament in 1913 and appointed himself emperor.

statement signed by a dozen leading Chinese dissidents, including former Tiananmen Square protest leaders Wang Dan and Wu'er Kaixi, also referenced the short-lived reign of the "Hongxian Emperor."

"We believe that the abolition of (term limits) is the equivalent of Yuan Shikai's revival of the imperial dynasty, it is the implementation of a new imperial system," the statement said.

History shows, they added, that lifelong "supreme rule and tyranny are inseparable and will surely bring great disasters to the country and its people."

Great power, great responsibility

While Xi's immediate grip on power is in little doubt, enabling him to enact whatever reforms and policies he desires, analysts warned that if things go south, he will have little room to avoid blame.

"If 'consolidation of power' was a precondition for implementing his reform program and leading the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, that condition has now been met and he needs to deliver," said Sullivan.

"And, if he doesn't deliver and refuses to go quietly, well that's a scenario we've seen play out in other regimes many times before," said Sullivan

A key test may come from outside China. Nowhere has Xi's new bullish leadership been more obvious than in China's foreign and military policy.

In the South China Sea, Beijing has continued the militarization of islands, reefs and islets in defiance of an international court ruling.

Under Xi, China has also taken a much tougher line on Taiwan . Beijing considers the self-ruled island, officially the Republic of China, part of its territory, and has not ruled out military action to reclaim it, even as support for full-independence from the mainland has grown among Taiwanese

Tom Rafferty, a China expert at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said China's "move in an authoritarian direction will harden the divisions that have emerged between it and the major western powers, pointing to heightened international tensions over security and economic policy in the coming years."

And if the Chinese economy under-performs or in an event of a foreign policy crisis like Taiwan, Xi's political strengths could quickly translate into liability, analysts warned.

For now, Rafferty said, "Xi is set to lead China until he dies, chooses to step down, or is purged."

__label__world Trita Parsi is the author of " Losing an Enemy -- Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy " and the President of the National Iranian American Council. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) The world has become so numb to the words of the President of the United States that it even dismisses threats of war as either a political distraction or a Trumpian negotiation tactic.

Indeed, Donald Trump's threat to inflict on Iran "CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE" may very well have been an effort to divert attention from the Russia investigation. Others have dismissed the danger of the tweet since Trump did an about-face on North Korea, going from calling the North Korean dictator "rocket man" to a "very honorable" man. And, on Tuesday, Trump stated once again that he's "ready to make a deal" with Iran.

But there are five reasons why a pivot from threats to diplomacy with Iran will be much harder -- and why Trump's reckless threats may trap the United States in yet another war.

1. Saudi Arabia and Israel oppose diplomacy. Japan and South Korea advocated it.

The geopolitical circumstances around North Korea differ vastly from that of the Middle East. In the North Korean case, America's allies -- and even its Chinese competitor -- strongly opposed any military confrontation with Pyongyang and pushed for diplomacy. In fact, the pivot to diplomacy with North Korea had far more to do with the South Korean President's maneuvering in the background than Kim Jong Un fearing Trump's "fire and fury" or his sanctions.

In the Middle East, the situation is the opposite: American allies, such as Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have long opposed US-Iran diplomacy (with an impressive track record of sabotaging attempts at US-Iran dialogue). Mindful of their influence in Washington and the Trump administration's deference to them, any attempt by Trump to pivot to diplomacy with Iran will likely face a formidable challenge by these Middle Eastern powers.

Moreover, there is no obvious "South Korea" in the Middle East today that can quietly do behind-the-scenes shuttle diplomacy to bring the United States and Iran together -- at least not one Trump would engage.

Former President Barack Obama needed a go-between to make diplomacy with Iran bear fruit. In that case, it was the country of Oman, which helped establish a secret diplomatic channel with Iran, paving the way for the historic nuclear deal of 2015. But Trump is unlikely to turn to Oman precisely because Obama did so.

2. Trump thinks pressure will force Iran to negotiate. He's wrong.

Trump has stated that verbal escalation and sanctions will force Iran to come to the table. The logic is based on a misread of what brought about the nuclear deal of 2015. The conventional Washington narrative reads that Obama crippled Iran's economy till the rulers of Tehran grudgingly agreed to negotiate. But the secret negotiations between the US and Iran in Oman reveals a very different picture.

While Obama's sanctions were truly crushing -- Iran's GDP contracted more than 35% between 2012 and 2015 -- Tehran did not lack leverage of its own. Its response to the sanctions was to double down on its nuclear program and move ever closer to a nuclear weapon. Just as sanctions put pressure on Tehran, more centrifuges put the squeeze on Washington.

JUST WATCHED Cuomo: Trump making another play with Iran tweet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cuomo: Trump making another play with Iran tweet 03:30

It wasn't until the Obama administration secretly made a major concession to Iran -- agreeing that Iran could continue to enrich uranium on its own soil -- that diplomacy started to bear fruit.

In other words, a policy solely centered on sanctions and pressure did not bring about the desired breakthrough in the talks. Ultimately, it was American flexibility that ended the standstill and elicited Iranian flexibility.

Two conclusions can be drawn from America's past diplomatic experience with Iran. First, pressure alone will not work. Second, Iran will meet pressure with pressure. And herein lies the danger of Trump's approach: Even if he does not intend to draw this to a conflict, he may quickly lose control over the situation once the Iranians decide to counter-escalate by, for instance, reactivating their nuclear program.

3. North Korea has a one-man dictator. Iran has politics.

North Korea is run by a one-man dictator with the political maneuverability to dramatically shift policy from testing nuclear weapons to sitting down with the man who hurled insults at him -- without facing any domestic political consequences. Iran, on the other hand, has a complex political system where power is dispersed and not controlled by any single person or institute. Even Iran's Supreme Leader -- the most powerful man in Iran -- cannot act alone without taking into consideration both public and elite opinion.

Iran's fractured politics and factional infighting renders any dramatic policy shift -- particularly involving diplomacy with the United States -- all the more difficult. President Hassan Rouhani is already paying a political price for having been so "naive" as to negotiate with the "untrustworthy" Americans. The political space needed to restart negotiations, particularly after Iran adhered to the previous deal and Trump pulled out of it, simply does not exist right now and Trump's rhetoric is not moving matters in the right direction.

4. Don't forget: Trump hates Obama.

As Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group has pointed out, Trump's antipathy toward Obama and his obsession with undoing Obama's policy legacies should not be underestimated. As a Trump official told the Atlantic , "There's the Obama Doctrine, and the 'F--- Obama' Doctrine," he explained. "We're the 'F--- Obama' Doctrine."

On Iran, that may not just translate into Trump killing the nuclear deal against the advice of his Secretary of Defense. It may also mean that Trump will pursue a nuclear deal with North Korea at almost any cost (a problem Obama left largely untouched) while rejecting a deal with Iran (the country Obama decided to negotiate with). More than striking a "better deal" with Iran, Trump may think that truly sticking it to Obama necessitates burying diplomacy with Iran altogether.

5. Trump advisers don't want a deal; they want regime collapse.

The members of Trump's inner circle have changed dramatically over the past few months. The so-called "adults in the room," who had a moderating effect on Trump, have largely been replaced with ideological hawks, such as National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And uber-hawk Tom Cotton has emerged as one of the senators whose advice and viewpoints Trump pays close attention to.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

All three of these have a long track record of advocating confrontation with Iran. Bolton famously penned an op-ed in the New York Times at the height of the nuclear negotiations titled "To Stop an Iranian Bomb, Bomb Iran." As a congressman from the state of Kansas, Mike Pompeo quipped that bombing Iran would only take 2,000 fighter jet attacks, which he said "is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces." Cotton, in turn, is the author of the unprecedented letter in the midst of the nuclear talks, telling the leaders of Iran not to trust the President of the United States.

Going forward, the moderate voices inside the Trump White House will essentially be absent, while new advisers will likely egg on Trump to escalate tensions further -- even though the Trump administration continues to claim that its goal is not regime change.

All of this amounts to a sobering reality: Trump is embarking on a path of escalation without having the exit ramps he had with North Korea. The danger now is not to overestimate the risk of war, but to underestimate it.
__label__world New Delhi (CNN) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's scandal-ridden trip to India may be over, but the controversy surrounding it refuses to go away.

Trudeau has become embroiled in a fresh spat, following his apparent endorsement of allegations that factions within the Indian government had actively sought to undermine his visit to the country last week.

The comments, made during Trudeau's first parliamentary session since returning to Canada, provoked a swift rebuke from the Indian government, with a spokesman for India's foreign ministry labeling the suggestion "baseless and unacceptable."

The Trudeau family stands silhouetted in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra on February 18.

Trudeau's week-long India trip, which began on February 17, was marred by a series of poorly-judged missteps and unfortunate headlines, including persistent questions relating to his government's alleged indulgence of Sikh separatists.

The issue reached a head after it was revealed Jaspal Atwal , a militant Sikh separatist convicted of attempting to murder an Indian politician in Canada, had been invited to at least two Canadian government-linked events, including an official dinner with Trudeau at the Canadian High Commissioner's residence in New Delhi.

The dinner invitation, which was later withdrawn, sparked outrage in parts of India, where the issue of Sikh separatism remains a highly charged and emotive topic.

On Tuesday, Trudeau faced questions in parliament over reports in the Canadian press, sourced to an unidentified Canadian official, that the government of India had colluded to place Atwal at official events in order to embarrass Trudeau.

In response, Trudeau appeared to offer his support to the claims made in the reports. "When one of our top diplomats and security officials says something to Canadians, it is because they know it to be true."

The comments drew condemnation from Canadian opposition leader Andrew Scheer, as well as the Indian government

"The Government of India, including the security agencies, had nothing to do with the presence of Jaspal Atwal at the event hosted by the Canadian High Commissioner in Mumbai or the invitation issued to him for the Canadian High Commissioner's reception in New Delhi. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and unacceptable," said India's Ministry of External Affairs in a press statement released Wednesday.

Canadian lawmaker and member of Trudeau's ruling Liberal Party, Randeep S. Sarai, had previously claimed responsibility for Atwal's official invitation. "I want to again apologize for my role in recent unfortunate events. Moving forward, I will be exercising better judgment," he said in a tweet posted Wednesday.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with his wife and three children, arrive in New Delhi on February 17.

Atwal scandal

It remains unclear how Atwal, a known militant who in 1987 was sentenced to 20 years in a Canadian court for his part in the attempted murder of a visiting Indian state minister, managed to obtain a visa to enter into India.

Atwal was one of four men who ambushed and shot Malkiat Singh Sidhu, a then-member of Punjab's cabinet, who was visiting Canada for a relative's wedding, badly wounding him.

In the sentencing, the judge called the crime "an act of terrorism in order to advance a cause."

Canada is home to about 468,000 Sikhs, comprising 1.4% of its population. A small but influential number of those Sikhs support the idea of Khalistan, or the demand for a separate state for Indian Sikhs.

The separatist issue goes back decades in India, with one of the most important clashes occurring in 1984 when Indian Army soldiers stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhs' holiest site, in an effort to capture separatist leaders.

In retaliation, India's then-leader, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her two Sikh bodyguards. According to official figures, the resulting anti-Sikh riots saw 2,733 people killed in the Indian capital alone. Human rights activists say the death toll was significantly higher.

In 1985, the violence spilled over into Canada, when Sikh separatists bombed an Air India plane that had taken off from Toronto airport, killing all 329 people aboard, including numerous Canadians of Indian descent. The only person who was convicted in the bombing was released in 2017 by Canadian courts after two decades in jail.

An armed Sikh rebellion operated in Punjab, the heartland of the faith, from the 1980s to the early 1990s, when it was crushed. Today, pockets of support remain in parts of the Sikh diaspora, including in Canada.

Trudeau has actively courted the Sikh vote, previously proclaiming that his cabinet has more Sikhs than Modi's. Analysts say a particular area of contention during Trudeau's India visit, was his appearance at a Sikh event in Toronto last year, where separatist flags and posters depicting an extremist Sikh leader killed in the 1984 Indian Army operation were displayed.

"I embrace all in affection," Pope says

Migrants weep as they ask for blessing

(CNN) Pope Francis spoke of empathy and mercy as he met Saturday with migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos. Then to demonstrate his message, he took 12 of them to the Vatican with him aboard the papal plane.

Francis made a well-publicized visit to the island, home to migrants and refugees who have fled war and violence in the Middle East and North Africa. The Pope invited three Syrian migrant families to go with him as he returned home, the Holy See Press Office said.

The Vatican will take responsibility for the three families, the statement said. All are from Syria.

"The Pope has desired to make a gesture of welcome regarding refugees, accompanying on his plane to Rome three families of refugees from Syria, 12 people in all, including six children," the statement said.

These are people who were already in camps in Lesbos before a European Union-Turkey agreement in which anyone crossing into Greece illegally from Turkey will be returned. All three families are Muslim. Two families come from Damascus, and one from Deir Ezzor, the statement continued. "Their homes had been bombed."

(CNN) Considering the known circumstances surrounding the accident of AeroMexico's Flight 2431 in Durango, Mexico, we shouldn't be surprised that that the accident was survivable. The Embraer 190 was en route to Mexico City on Tuesday when it crashed within moments after becoming airborne, skidding through underbrush and coming to an abrupt halt not quite 400 feet from the departure end of the runway.

Dozens were injured. But none of the 103 on board died. How is that possible?

The words "plane crash" immediately suggest a tragic outcome. But an accident doesn't always end like that.

Think of this, for a moment, in terms of a similar event in a car. We'd all agree that automobile crashes are much more frequent, and with victims walking away most times. Why? Not only are 21st century automobiles designed with more protective safeguards, but most accidents happen at survivable speeds.

If the same basic automobile accident theory is applied to Flight 2431, then survival outcome in a plane crash like this becomes easier to understand. The accident occurred shortly after takeoff. Depending upon the airplane's gross weight, its immediate airborne speed was approximately 155 mph.

(CNN) On Friday, President Donald Trump canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's trip to North Korea, citing the lack of progress on denuclearization and blaming China. "Because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization," Trump tweeted .

Trump is right. His trade war with China is undermining diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea, as well as other US objectives.

On Thursday, as trade talks between American and Chinese officials failed to make any progress, the Trump administration's tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect . China retaliated in kind with its own tariffs on a similar amount of US goods. Trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and Beijing is ready to keep the cycle going.

Trump still seems to think that this trade war is going to lead to an easy win. Earlier this week, Trump boasted at a rally : "When I came we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time. That's not going to happen anymore." Trump's attitude is being interpreted in Beijing as a sign that Trump doesn't just want to equalize a trade imbalance, but instead wants to stop China's growth altogether. That has rankled Beijing, with some likening it to the start of a new Cold War.

So it's no surprise that we're seeing the diplomatic consequences of our deteriorating relationship with China. The cancellation of Pompeo's visit to North Korea shows that Trump may be beginning to grasp just how significant a problem this could be for US national security.

Pyongyang has a long history of promising to denuclearize and subsequently failing to follow through. It's not because of China that North Korea is repeating this pattern and failing to give up their weapons. But China wields leverage over North Korea by virtue of being its largest trading partner (it accounts for more than 90% of North Korea's foreign trade) and Beijing could exert more economic pressure on Pyongyang. That could force North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to choose whether to feed his people or continue to pursue his nuclear weapons program. Instead, China is giving North Korea a pass by failing to comply with existing sanctions.

This isn't anything new. China has at times worked with the international community to pressure North Korea. More often than not, however, China has failed to implement international sanctions. But there's more at stake this time.

In April, Trump credited Chinese President Xi Jinping for being a constructive partner on North Korea, tweeting: "Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him, it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!" But now Xi is playing a very different role.

While US intelligence , as well as reporting from the International Atomic Energy Agency , indicates that North Korea may still be developing its nuclear program, Xi has suggested ending sanctions against North Korea. Xi is reportedly also considering going to Pyongyang in September. A visit by Xi would be a huge diplomatic win for Kim, as it would be the first visit by a Chinese president to North Korea since the hermit kingdom's resumed its missile testing in 2006.

China is also taking other worrying steps. It is participating in Russia's Vostok 2018 war games, which begin at the end of the month, the first time China has taken part in this military exercise. And last month, China joined Russia's aerial drills , another first for Sino-Russia cooperation.

China has the ability to undermine our objectives across the globe. Trump's acknowledgment that Beijing is not helping us with North Korea is just the beginning of the diplomatic fallout we may see from his trade war.

(CNN) Wriggling his backside further into the velvet luxury of the 19th Century armchair, Vladimir Putin could be forgiven a sigh of satisfaction.

He mirthlessly smiled at an exchange on Russia 1's "60 Minutes" political panel discussion as it dissected his recent summit with Donald Trump.

Leonid Kalashnikov (Russian State Duma): "America is to blame for the deterioration in relations, he wrote this on Twitter even before the meeting!"

Evgeny Popov (host): "Look, it's really strange, he's the President of that exact country, how can he say that ... It's really odd, well, you can't bash your own country, especially when you're its President."

Olga Skabeeva (host): "Well, yes, especially when he [Trump] says that because of the foolishness and stupidity of the United States, we have bad Russian-American relations. Indeed, this smells like he is a Kremlin agent..."

The dialogue is CNN's verbatim transcription and translation of a part of Tuesday night's show, the day after the Helsinki summit.

Of course, I'm speculating at Putin's reaction. Perhaps he was a little put out at the suggestion that Trump was an asset. But sometimes (and as former director of the FSB, the successor organization to the KGB, he should know), hiding in plain sight can be the best place to seek invisibility.

But in any case, the Russian President's resting face is one of self-confident self-satisfaction. Over the last few days he could be forgiven for being outright smug. Perhaps even allowing himself a conspiratorial wink in the shaving mirror.

After all, for Putin, things are falling into place.

No matter that a dozen of his alleged GRU (military intelligence agents) had been indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe for attempting to disrupt the 2106 US elections.

Nor that British investigators are closing in on who they believe were Russian agents behind the use of a globally banned nerve agent in the sleepy cathedral city of Salisbury.

No matter that human-rights groups were screaming "murder!" at his air force's bombing of Syrian civilians.

No matter that this was the fourth anniversary of the killing of 298 people on an Malaysia Airlines flight shot down with a Russian BUK missile over Ukraine.

This "Tsar" had seldom seemed less vulnerable (another irony on the 100th anniversary of the murder of Russia's last royals, the Romanovs).

No. Things were good.

After all, some useful idiots were rampaging around among his enemies sowing just the sort of discord and chaos that he would love to have ordered. It was as if they really were his agents.

Attributed, probably erroneously, to Lenin describing liberal supporters in the West who could be relied on to spread Bolshevik propaganda, the term "useful idiot" was often applied to members of groups like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

The Soviets sought to help and influence CND, left-wing politicians, trade unionists and artists into undermining the West, inside the West. The "idiots" were not traitors. They knew not what they did. They were dupes.

Now US President Donald Trump was being accused of treason by a former head of the Central Intelligence Agency. That, to Putin, is useful.

Why would the former FSB chief not chuckle? There's nothing like universal distrust and doubt at the highest levels in the leadership of the enemy to ensure a good night's sleep.

Twenty years ago, a younger Putin, an expert on Eastern Germany, had seen the Soviet-dominated nations like Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria the Baltic states, slough off the Kremlin's yoke and embrace democracy, membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.

Russia's military might had been spent. Its prestige diluted. The very idea of the Cominitern -- international communism -- buried by capitalism.

Mother Russia was barefoot and humiliated after the rapacious collapse of the Soviet Union in the '90s.

Russia was powerless, it seemed, to stop Georgia and then Ukraine (homeland of the original Russ tribes!) flirting with membership of the NATO and European clubs.

There had to be another way to restore Russian pride and regional power. To get its presence felt in the world. Perhaps the West's own power was its greatest weakness.

Nothing rots armor plating like complacency. Now that the West believed it had won, it was going to learn otherwise.

Touring Europe, Trump railed at NATO. He threatened to pull funding from the military alliance that has protected the West for 70 years. He'd even cast doubt on the doctrine of "an attack on one is an attack on all," which had bonded big nation to small throughout the years of the Soviet threat.

With "enemies" like Trump, Vladimir Putin hardly needed friends.

Add to that the idea that the US President disrespected US intelligence and then backtracked on his very clear statement a day after and the scene becomes surreal.

Trump's full-blown praise of Putin had become embarrassing.

No wonder Putin had intervened during the Helsinki press conference to put across the American view of his annexation of the Crimean peninsula.

It had to be tempered even by the Russian President himself. There was a danger of global incredulity at these incredible scenes.

But this has been a week of rich harvest for the Kremlin.

Chaos in Washington matched with tumult in the Mother of Parliaments, in London.

If there is one organization he detested, and feared, as much as NATO it is the European Union. It knitted together disparate nations into a vast democratic behemoth capable of swallowing and infecting Russia's neighbors with its free trade and freedoms.

But, thanks to the British, it was now pulling itself apart.

Led by men who were unwilling, or unable, to see that whatever benefits they thought Britain leaving the EU could bring, those advantages were going to be met with parallel strategic benefits to Russia.

The EU would be weakened. Its centrifugal forces (with a little encouragement) could be exploited through nationalism, especially among the young democracies of Eastern Europe, which could be turned to look nostalgically back towards Moscow.

These movements would need charismatic champions. Men for whom truth is mutable, expertise to be shunned.

Take Boris Johnson, a perfect foil for Russian interests. A performer loved at home and derided abroad. A symbol of the very Western decadence Russia nationalists were encouraged to believe Putin protected them against.

Inexplicably anti-European, he'd risen to become the UK's Foreign Secretary before resigning in a bid to smash existing Brexit plans. Yet he's not published a word, not one coherent word, of how he saw an "independent" Britain making its way in the world.

Johnson is backed up by Nigel Farage, who is alleged to have links to WikiLeaks -- itself linked to Russian intelligence operations.

And his campaign funding is now under police investigation while darkness surrounds the role of Russia in the whole farrago.

How utterly exquisite. Putin could not make this up -- surely?

For Putin, chaos in the ranks of his enemies is victory. And without a shot being fired directly at NATO or the EU, nor any violence against America, there is chaos in Europe, Britian and America.

All driven by men who one could not say were traitors, nor even idiots, but they have been most useful -- to Putin's Russia.
__label__world (CNN) For years, she was the epitome of the peaceful protester, steadfast in her devotion to democracy in her homeland of Myanmar through nonviolent means.

Aung San Suu Kyi was lauded on the global stage, awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, and praised for her refusal to incite violence while under house arrest for 15 years after winning a presidential election the ruling military refused to accept.

Now,protesters around the region are torching effigies of the democracy icon. They are furious at her failure to act while Myanmar's military lays waste to land held by the minority Rohingya Muslims , shooting civilians and sparking a mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of people who have been denied citizenship in the Buddhist-dominated country.

"These are mass killings and they're taking place right now and Aung San Suu Kyi's office is not only doing nothing to stop it -- in some ways they're throwing fuel on the fire," said Matthew Smith, founder of human rights groups Fortify Rights, who was speaking from Kutupalong Refugee camp in Bangladesh, where many Rohingya have fled.

While it is the country's military that has cracked down on the Rohingya in this latest spasm of violence, Suu Kyi is considered the country's de facto leader. Her official post is State Counsellor and she is said to be the President's confidante.

Moral face of Myanmar

Her father, Gen. Aung San, is revered as the country's founder after it gained independence from the British in 1948. And as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for being "an outstanding example of the power of the powerless," the expectation and pressure she faces to be the moral face of Myanmar is undeniable.

On November 27, 2017, Suu Kyi was stripped of the Freedom of the City of Oxford award, which honored her in 1997 for "her opposition to oppression and military rule in Burma," the Oxford City Council said in a statement released online . "Oxford has a long tradition of being a diverse and humane city, and our reputation is tarnished by honoring those who turn a blind eye to violence."

Two weeks earlier, Irish singer and activist Bob Geldof returned his Freedom of the City of Dublin award because it had also been given to Aung San Suu Kyi. She "was extravagantly welcomed to this city, and I was a participant to that ... and it turned out that she's a killer, and I don't want to be on the same list as what the UN described as a genocide," Geldof said.

Suu Kyi has ostensibly made it her life's work to fight for human rights and democracy, which has made her silence over the Rohingya crisis so grating for her supporters to see. But even before the most recent developments, Suu Kyi had displayed a disconcerting sensibility regarding Muslims in Myanmar.

Her attitude toward some of the ethnic groups which make up Myanmar's population was clear for anyone to see over years of media interviews.

In a 2013 television interview with BBC News, she disputed the characterization of the violence being perpetrated against the Rohingya at the time as ethnic cleansing. She was criticized then, too, for not standing up for the persecuted minority, who were being kept in internment camps while Buddhist nationalists and firebrand monks spread anti-Muslim sentiment across the country.

"This is what the world needs to understand, that the fear is not just on the side of the Muslims, but on the side of the Buddhists as well," she said. When journalist Mishal Husain argued that the violence had inordinately affected Muslims and caused tens of thousands to flee, Suu Kyi didn't mention Muslims at all in her answer.

"I think there are many many Buddhists who have also left the country for various reasons and there are many Buddhists who are in refugee camps. This is the result of our sufferings. I think if you live under a dictatorship for many years, people don't learn to trust one another."

According to a book published later, Suu Kyi reportedly emerged from the interview remarking: "No one told me I was going to be interviewed by a Muslim."

Just a politician

Those who continue to defend Suu Kyi argue that even with the extremely influential post she now holds, the Nobel laureate and her civilian partners in government don't control the military and. therefore. cannot intervene in its campaigns, including the fighting raging in Rakhine State.

British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said Suu Kyi "faces huge challenges modernizing her country," and that it was "vital that she receives the support of the Burmese military, and that her attempts at peacemaking are not frustrated," referring to Myanmar by its colonial-era name of Burma.

"She and all in Burma have our full support in this," Johnson said in early September.

In 2011, when Suu Kyi was censured for her unwillingness to criticize the military, her backers in the West argued that she couldn't have actually done very much since she was a member of the opposition and that speaking out might have undone any chance she might have had to pursue political power, something she and her party were focused on at the time. Coming down on the military in any way would have been a backward step for Myanmar's progress, they contended.

But in some Western corners at least, the tide may be turning. On September 1, the Washington Post Editorial Board pondered whether it was "too much to ask her to summon the inspiration to lead Burma away from the increasingly bitter and violent conflict with the Rohingya?"

"She might want to reread her Nobel text," the board remarked, pointing to her words that summoned an original aim "to create a world free from the displaced, the homeless and the hopeless ... a world of which each and every corner is a true sanctuary where the inhabitants will have the freedom and the capacity to live in peace." The Board concluded: "This is not the world of the Rohingya in today's Burma."

In an interview earlier this year with the BBC , reporter Fergal Keane asked Suu Kyi whether she thought that people in the West had misjudged or mischaracterized her, "expecting you to be this sort of amalgam of Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa, for example, and actually maybe you're closer in your determination and steeliness to someone like [former British Prime Minister] Margaret Thatcher?"

"Well no," Suu Kyi answered. "I am just a politician. I am not quite like Margaret Thatcher, no, but on the other hand, I am no Mother Teresa, either. I have never said that I was. Mahatma Gandhi, actually, was a very astute politician."
__label__world Beijing (CNN) Taiwan has lost another diplomatic ally to China, its third in a matter of months, after El Salvador announced it would sever ties with the island and switch its allegiance to Beijing.

The governments in Taipei, Beijing and San Salvador all confirmed the development Tuesday, just days after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited Central and South America to cement ties with the island's remaining allies.

The loss of the Central American country reduces the number of Taipei's formal diplomatic allies to just 17. Both Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic cut ties with Taiwan in May.

__label__world (CNN) As Pope Francis prepares to celebrate Mass with half a million faithful in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, thousands are expected to take to the streets in protest over clerical sexual abuse amid an intensifying outcry over Church-related scandals spanning the globe.

It's a very different reception -- and a very different Ireland -- to the last papal visit in 1979, when Pope John Paul II was greeted like a rock star in Phoenix Park by nearly one-third of the country's population.

"The church's hold on public life in Ireland has fundamentally changed since '79," John Allen, who has written multiple books on the Vatican, told CNN.

In the nearly four decades that have elapsed, Ireland has become a far less Catholic country both socially and legally. Irish voters have struck down bans on divorce, same-sex marriage and, most recently, abortion. And Ireland's church attendance has waned from 90% to about 30% as revelations of abuse by Catholic-run institutions continue to damage its moral authority and diminish its influence.

On Saturday, the Pope again apologized for the "appalling" historic child abuse in the Church after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called for "zero tolerance" against predator priests and to ensure "that from words flow actions."

__label__world (CNN) Images of a whale hunt in the Faroe Islands 200 miles north of Scotland have sparked renewed anger from conservationists and animal activists.

The pictures show dozens of whales being herded into a bay where they are killed, the sea turning red with their blood.

The hunt took place in the bay of Sandavágur on the western island of Vágar on July 30 and involved pilot whales, according to the government of the Faroe Islands. It was one of several legal hunts that take place every summer in the archipelago. It was documented by Alastair Ward, who said he was visiting to celebrate his graduation from the University of Cambridge in the UK.

Reacting to the images on Twitter, the Blue Planet Society, a UK-based pressure group, condemned the killings , describing the Faroe Islands as an "archaic country" that needs to "join the 21st century."

"These people have no respect, no empathy, and no need," they wrote . "This is entertainment for them."

__label__world (CNN) A heist and deadly crash of a passenger plane in the Seattle area has left the family of the airport employee who stole the plane devastated and the nation questioning the vulnerability of airport security.

Richard Russell took off in a stolen plane at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Friday night, flew for about an hour with military jets chasing him and crashed the 76-seater Horizon Air plane in a wooded island, authorities said.

Russell was the only person aboard, and did not survive, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said.

In a statement, his family said his "intent was not to harm anyone," referring to audio recordings of Russell talking to air traffic control during the flight.

"This is a complete shock to us," the family said in a statement Saturday night. "We are devastated by these events, and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now."

Richard Russell worked at Horizon Air for years

Russell had worked as a Horizon Air ground service agent for three-and-a-half years. His job included directing aircraft for takeoff and gate approach, handling baggage and tidying and de-icing planes.

Richard Russell, or "Beebo" as some called him, was "a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend," his family said.

The 29-year-old was "kind and gentle to each person he met," his family said in a statement Saturday night.

Officials don't believe Russell had a pilot's license, and they don't know how he knew to fly the plane. Jeremy Kaelin said he worked with Russell in 2016, and remembered "happy, funny" chats with him in the break room.

"He was a nice guy," Kaelin said. "He was definitely one of the harder working people on the ramps."

F-15s did not bring the plane down.

Russell had worked a shift Friday when he took a plane parked in a maintenance area of the Seattle-Tacoma airport, said Brad Tilden, CEO of Alaska Air Group, which owns Horizon Air.

He used a vehicle known as a pushback tractor to move the empty 76-seat Horizon Air turboprop plane and took off without authorization at 7:32 p.m. local time Friday, officials said.

Russell flew for about an hour, talking periodically with air traffic controllers and making turns and even some aerobatic maneuvers as two armed F-15 jets followed him, officials said.

JUST WATCHED Hear audio from before plane crashed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear audio from before plane crashed 01:12

Video from a witness on the ground shows the plane at one point pulling up for a loop, putting the aircraft upside-down and then pulling back up just feet above a body of water.

The plane eventually crashed on sparsely populated Ketron Island, starting a fire in the woods and killing Russell. No one outside the plane was injured, officials said.

The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known but authorities said the F-15s did not bring the plane down.

Gaps in airline security

While the crash only killed Russell, the brazen stealing of a commercial airline from a major US airport has exposed a gap in airline security.

FBI said it does not consider the incident terror-related as authorities try to piece together how a security scare of that magnitude occurred at major airport.

Investigators on Saturday were trying to retrieve the plane's flight data recorder and its cockpit voice recorder.

"He might have been talking to himself in the cockpit," so the voice recorder may provide additional information that wasn't recorded in radio traffic, said Debra Eckrote, regional chief for the National Transportation Safety Board.

Experts say the crash exposed alarming gaps in airport security, and is likely to prompt a major review industry security measures.

"This is going to be a major learning event for the industry," CNN aviation analyst Justin Green said. "This is a really big deal."

Russell managed to steal a 76-seat Horizon Air turboprop from a maintenance area by himself. He was in uniform, had proper credentials and had clearance to be in secure aircraft areas, according to Brad Tilden, Alaska Airlines CEO.

"They're credential employees. They're there to work on the airplanes. ... This is aviation in America. The doors of the airplanes are not keyed like a car. There is not an ignition key like a car. The setup in aviation in America is we secure the airfield," Tilden told reporters Saturday.

He appeared to have broken protocol several times. He shouldn't have been able to board the plane alone and go unnoticed. He also moved the plane by himself while protocol calls for two people to tow an aircraft.

"The fact he was out there by himself, towing the aircraft by himself ... then moving the tracker out of the way, so he could get on the aircraft and move. The fact that all of that happened without even being noticed by anyone on the ground service crew, that is just phenomenal to me," said CNN analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie.
__label__world Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) Sweden has been plunged into political uncertainty after both the main centrist coalitions failed to win a majority in general elections Sunday, and as the far-right anti-immigration party gained ground, further fracturing the vote.

A long period of political wrangling is expected as the eight parties that won seats in parliament try to build a working government. Either the center-left and center-right blocs will have to coordinate to pass legislation, or they will have to renege on promises to never work with the far-right Sweden Democrats, a party that has roots in the neo-Nazi movement and has capitalized on the nation's growing migration fears.

Leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats Jimmie Åkesson speaks at the party election center on Sunday.

The talks will be a test of one of the few remaining left-wing bastions in Europe, a region leaning further to the right after the mass migration of refugees in 2015, at the height of the Syrian war and as conflicts in Afghanistan and parts of Africa worsened.

The Sweden Democrats, who have promised to freeze migration and want to take the nation out of the European Union, gained ground with 17.6% of the vote, well up from the 12.9% it won in 2014, but short of the dramatic surge pollsters had predicted.

Its leader, Jimmie Akesson, treated the gains as an election win and basked in his role as kingmaker.

__label__world (CNN) A new grand jury report says that internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania show that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims.

"We believe that the real number of children whose records were lost or who were afraid ever to come forward is in the thousands," the grand jury report says.

"Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all. For decades. Monsignors, auxiliary bishops, bishops, archbishops, cardinals have mostly been protected; many, including some named in this report, have been promoted."

The grand jury described the church's methods as "a playbook for concealing the truth" after FBI agents identified a series of practices they found in diocese files.

The lengthy report , released Tuesday afternoon, investigates clergy sexual abuse dating to 1947 in six dioceses: Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton.

Pennsylvania's two other dioceses, Philadelphia and Altoona-Johnstown, have been the subjects of earlier grand jury reports, which found similarly damaging information about clergy and bishops in those dioceses.

"There have been other reports about child sex abuse within the Catholic Church. But never on this scale," the grand jurors wrote in Tuesday's report.

"For many of us, those earlier stories happened someplace else, someplace away. Now we know the truth: it happened everywhere."

The grand jurors said that "almost every instance of abuse we found is too old to be prosecuted." But charges have been filed against two priests, one in Erie diocese and another in Greensburg diocese, who have been accused of abusing minors.

"We learned of these abusers directly from their dioceses -- which we hope is a sign that the church is finally changing its ways," the grand jurors said. "And there may be more indictments in the future; investigation continues."

At a news conference announcing the report's release, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro called it the "largest, most comprehensive report into child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church ever produced in the United States."

Molestations and rapes

At times, the lengthy catalog of clergy sexual abuses in the report is difficult to read. As the grand jurors note, priests and other Catholic leaders victimized boys and girls, teens and pre-pubescent children.

Some victims were plied with alcohol and groped or molested, the report says. Others were orally, vaginally or anally raped, according to the grand jurors.

"But all of them were brushed aside, in every part of the state, by church leaders who preferred to protect the abusers and their institution above all."

Among the more egregious cases, the grand jury reports that:

• In the Greensburg diocese, a priest impregnated a 17-year-old, forged a pastor's signature on a marriage certificate and divorced the girl months later. According to the grand jury, the priest was allowed to stay in ministry by finding a "benevolent bishop."

• Another priest in Greensburg groomed middle-school students for sex, according to the grand jury, by telling them that Mary had to "bite off the cord" and "lick" Jesus clean after the Nativity.

• In Harrisburg, a priest abused five sisters from the same family and collected samples of their urine, pubic hair and menstrual blood.

• Also in Harrisburg, a priest raped a 7-year-old girl who was in the hospital after her tonsils were removed, according to the report.

• In Pittsburgh, church officials said that a 15-year-old boy "pursued" and "literally seduced" a priest. A church report later acknowledged that the priest had admitted to "sado-masochistic" activities with several boys.

• In the Allentown diocese, a priest admitted sexually molesting a boy and pleaded for help, according to documents, but was left in ministry for several more years.

• Also in Allentown, a priest who had abused several boys, according to the grand jury, was given a recommendation to work at Disney World.

• In Scranton, a priest who later served prison time for abusing children was found to have been HIV-positive for years.

Tuesday's news conference began with a short video of three victims who told how they were abused and how it changed their lives.

An 83-year-old man said he couldn't show any affection to his wife and children as a result of the abuse he suffered. A woman said the abuse started when she was 18 months old. Another man said, "When you have the priest touching you every day, that's a hard memory to have. The first erection that you have is at the hands of a priest."

The victims said this was "not a vendetta against the church" and that abusers have "to be accountable in the church for what they did."

'Grave failings'

The grand jury's searing report comes as the Catholic Church, including Pope Francis, is struggling to contain a sexual abuse scandal rapidly consuming the church on several continents.

In Australia, a bishop has been found guilty of covering up sexual abuse. In Chile, the Pope was forced to recant his dismissal of an abuse scandal involving a prominent priest and bishops accused of covering up his crimes.

And in the United States, a prominent archbishop was removed from the powerful College of Cardinals following reports that he had molested a teenage altar boy and several others while he was rising through the church's ranks. Meanwhile, bishops in Boston and Nebraska are investigating possible cases of sexual abuse in Catholic seminaries.

"The report of the Pennsylvania grand jury again illustrates the pain of those who have been victims of the crime of sexual abuse by individual members of our clergy, and by those who shielded abusers and so facilitated an evil that continued for years or even decades," Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Bishop Timothy L. Doherty, chair of the bishops' Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, said in a statement.

"As a body of bishops, we are shamed by and sorry for the sins and omissions by Catholic priests and Catholic bishops."

The Vatican declined to comment on the grand jury report.

DiNardo and Doherty noted that the grand jury's report spans 70 years, and many of the abuse accusations were made before 2002, when the bishops adopted new policies. The policies, known as the Dallas Charter, after the city in which they were adopted, have been revised in 2011 and 2018.

The charter, the bishops said, "commits us to respond promptly and compassionately to victims, report the abuse of minors, remove offenders and take ongoing action to prevent abuse."

For weeks, many Catholics in the United States had been warily waiting for the Pennsylvania grand jury's report, especially as bishops in the state began publicly releasing the names of accused clergy in an apparent attempt to preempt some of the report's findings.

In a statement on Monday before the report was published, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the former Bishop of Pittsburgh who now heads the Archdiocese of Washington, said the report "will be a reminder of the grave failings that the church must acknowledge and for which it must seek forgiveness."

"We are now in the midst of a new era where our communal bonds of trust are once again being tested by the sin of abuse."

Delays in publication

Court action had delayed the report's publication. A number of individuals named in the report claimed that its findings were false or misleading, that they were denied due process of law and that its release would impair their reputations.

On July 27, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered the grand jury report to be released by 2 p.m. August 14 with redactions in sections where litigation was ongoing.

"A comprehensive investigation by the Office of Attorney General found widespread sexual abuse of children and a systematic coverup by leaders of the Catholic Church," Shapiro said in his letter.

Harrisburg abuse list

On August 1, the leader of one of the largest Roman Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania released a list identifying 71 priests, deacons and seminarians accused of "substantiated" sexual misconduct over the past seven decades.

Bishop Ronald Gainer of the Harrisburg Diocese also issued an apology on behalf of the religious community.

"That conduct has left a legacy of pain and sorrow that is still being felt," he wrote. "I apologize for these actions."

While most men on the Harrisburg list are accused of sexually abusing children, others were investigated for inappropriate behavior, such as kissing or inappropriately communicating with a minor, Gainer wrote. Others were accused of viewing or possessing child pornography.

The list did not say how the diocese handled most of the accusations and did not give the men's current whereabouts, though a few cases that were forwarded to civil authorities were more detailed.

(CNN) Don't count on sanctions to drive Iran to Donald Trump's bargaining table. Bill Clinton tried that gambit 20 years go. It led to a decade of grief and misery for the Iranian people and set the world even closer to a nuclear-armed Iran.

Without question, there have been cases where sanctions have worked. The almost universally observed sanctions against South Africa eventually played a major role in bringing an end to apartheid and freeing the imprisoned leader Nelson Mandela. Equally, it is likely that the increasingly tough sanctions on North Korea played a role in bringing Kim Jong Un to the summit with Trump, though there is still no evidence that Kim is prepared to dismantle his nuclear program.

But Iran is a different case -- and history is our guide. And, more importantly, there's already a strong suggestion that history is poised to repeat itself.

The evidence of the failure of sanctions is buried in a large collection of international cables, e-mails and memoranda, which the Washington-based National Security Archives managed to have declassified, at least in part. In the mid-1990s, the warnings were simple and direct: ratchet up sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program, and it will be pushed ever more deeply into the arms of its most rabid extremists. Sure enough, Clinton did ratchet them up, and the results were exactly what were predicted.

The warnings were strikingly similar in tone and language to many of those Trump has been hearing today. So, let's examine these warnings and their consequences.

Sanctions have been a part of American relations with Iran from the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, but especially since the time extremists seized the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, beginning in November 1979. Sanctions invoked by President Jimmy Carter had virtually no impact on the hostages' fate. Their release came on the morning Ronald Reagan was sworn in as Carter's successor.

But, in 1995, amid growing fears that Iran had embarked on a full-scale program to develop a deliverable nuclear weapon, Clinton imposed new sanctions , barring all American involvement with Iran's petroleum industry. By 1997, he'd turned the screws even tighter, banning all American trade with the country and recommended other countries to follow suit.

It was here that the cables pick up. "We do not view such pressure as an alternative to dialogue," then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote in January 1996. Indeed, such a viewpoint was clearly held not only by the administration but by America's European allies and Middle Eastern friends as well.

"It would be very dangerous to isolate Iran totally," French President Jacques Chirac told the American ambassador to Paris, which the embassy promptly cabled to Christopher. "Experience proves that the US embargo benefits only the extremists." This was not only the view of the French, who had their own lucrative economic engagements with Iran at the time, but senior officials along the Persian Gulf, who would be far more directly affected. In June 1995, a cable from the American embassy in Abu Dhabi warned Christopher that a UAE official observed, "If Iran were pushed over the brink, the aftermath could prove risks for the entire region," adding that it was "neither necessary nor desirable for the US to take additional measures against Iran."

The fear throughout was that the consequences would be potentially horrific. And so they proved to be as the Clinton sanctions, taken to a new and higher level, were ratcheted up even further under his successor, George W. Bush who froze assets of individuals and businesses identified as aiding and abetting Iranian-sponsored terrorism, including non-Iranian banks doing business there.

Within Iran, the sanctions were beginning to bite, Kenneth Pollack, a scholar at Brookings Institution, describing them as "their greatest nightmare" since 1990.

And the results followed much of the script contained in the warning cables. The president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, elected twice, in 1989 and 1993, was described in his New York Times obituary as "a Machiavellian and often ruthless player in the power struggles among Iran's elite factions, protected by his close association with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolutionary leader who overthrew the shah in 1979." While considered a centrist, Rafsanjani would eventually head the Assembly of Experts who chose the Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as Iran's Supreme Leader -- and determined foe of the United States.

Throughout this period, the sanctions offered little restraint on Iran's progress toward developing a deliverable nuclear weapon -- until the talks in 2015 led to the nuclear treaty putting the brakes on all such Iranian efforts.

Today, with his Iran sanctions efforts, Trump is taking us back to the 90s, with no assurance that sanctions will prove any more effective now than they were under Clinton or Bush. Indeed, if all restraints come off and Iran begins to rebuild its nuclear capabilities, Tehran could still have a bomb in a year, perhaps even a few months by some estimates.

On Monday, Iran's Supreme Leader issued his own warning, saying that Iran would not participate in negotiations in the face of the latest round of US sanctions, though he pledged there would be "no war." Still, it was clear that Khamenei is as fully prepared to stand up to Trump as he was to Clinton, even in the face of sanctions that do appear to be biting into the already strapped Iranian economy. With the Iranian ria l plunging 70% in value since May, some major Tehran money exchanges don't even list dollars or euros anymore.

At the same time, there is already the same ascendancy of extremist elements that the Clinton-era cables warned about. "Iran's senior officials are attempting to head off a looming economic crisis -- triggered by the return of US sanctions -- with threats of new rights-abusing policies," Human Rights Watch warned last Friday. They pointed to Tehran's prosecutor Jafari Dolotabadi, who's suggesting that importers who abuse government subsidies could be charged with "corruption on earth," which carries the death penalty. It is a warning not to be taken lightly as the government executed at least 507 individuals last year, according to Human Rights Watch estimates.

The sanctions are also beginning to have an impact on some of Iran's neighbors. When Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, tried to walk a delicate tightrope, opposing the Trump sanctions while reluctantly agreeing to observe them, Iran let it be known that Abadi's planned visit to Tehran would not be welcome.

Still, we have a little breathing room before the next round of even more crippling sanctions kicks in this November. At that time, as Trump tweeted, with some apparent glee, "Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!"

But as we can learn from examining the world of 20 years ago, the United States should not trust sanctions to drive Iran to the bargaining table, at least not anytime soon, and they will definitely not produce world peace. After all, it took more than a decade and the united force of six nations—the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (US, Britain, France, Russia and China) plus Germany, none of whom have bought into the new round of American sanctions, to arrive at the Iran accord that Trump has ditched. Perhaps a will to negotiate can be found on both sides before the next round rolls in.
__label__world London (CNN) The storyline's straight out of a spy thriller: two men allegedly dispatched from Moscow to eliminate a defector in a quiet English city -- but leaving traces of their movements everywhere to be painstakingly recreated by the intrepid British police.

British Prime Minister Theresa May went into great detail about the movements of the two middle-aged men on their brief visit to England in March. They entered the country using aliases, as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. They twice visited Salisbury, and, she says, on the second trip they applied the deadly nerve agent Novichok to the front door of Sergei Skripal's home, before carelessly discarding a perfume bottle adapted to carry the poison.

That same evening, according to May, the duo left London's Heathrow airport on a return flight to Moscow.

May said the UK intelligence services had established that both were officers of Russian military intelligence (the GRU).

"Were these two suspects within our jurisdiction there would be a clear basis in law for their arrest for murder," May added, following the death of Dawn Sturgess when she came into contact with the disposed Novichok.

Inevitably, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed May's account, saying that "neither top Russian authorities nor the lower-ranking authorities or any other officials had anything to do with the Salisbury events."

In a rare interview earlier this year with a Russian Defense Ministry newspaper, a former head of the GRU, Fyodor Ladygin, said: "The Russian intelligence agency where I had the honor to work for many years... never resorted to such heinous acts as the ones that Britain is trying to implicate it in."

But May's account assembled evidence that brought strong support from the UK's allies in the UN Security Council. So the question is: were these alleged agents incompetent -- or just indifferent to being discovered? Did Russia want the world to know, yes, we did it? Are its operatives careless or is deniability deemed unnecessary?

The Main Directorate

While still commonly referred to as the GRU (Glavnoe Razvedyvatelnoe Upravlenie) or Main Intelligence Directorate, the agency actually changed its name to the Main Directorate (GU) in 2010. It very much sits within the military sphere; its head -- currently Igor Korobov -- reports to the Chief of the General Staff and Defense Minister.

In her statement on Wednesday, May described the GRU as as a "highly disciplined organization." But it's an agency where tradecraft is sometimes optional or sparingly applied. Digitally or otherwise, it leaves fingerprints. And it may not care.

Mark Galeotti of the Institute of International Relations in Prague and a seasoned watcher of the Russian security services, says the GRU is not like Russia's other intelligence services because it's essentially a "war-fighting instrument which is mission-oriented."

In the eyes of the GRU, says Galeotti, "the biggest sin is not to take advantage of an opportunity." It takes risks and is aggressive.

"By contrast, the foreign intelligence service or SVR is more like MI6, a white-collar organization with diplomatic cover that is risk-averse," Galeotti says.

The Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are shown on CCTV in Salisbury on March 4, 2018.

The Skripal case

"Petrov" and "Boshirov" didn't take steps to camouflage their travel. They flew direct from Moscow on Russian passports, Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said. They used public transport in England, where there are almost as many surveillance cameras as there are passengers.

Critically they stayed in a budget hotel where, according to British authorities, minute traces of Novichok were later found. They appear to have gone everywhere together, making them much easier to pick out for the detectives wading through more than 11,000 hours of surveillance video.

Britain's Security Minister Ben Wallace said the duo had failed in their mission (if it was to kill Skripal.) "They couldn't run a bath in the GRU," Wallace told British media Thursday. Conservative MP Johnny Mercer tweeted after May's disclosures: "I hope this toilet tradecraft will help reduce perception that Russia is some intelligence/military behemoth to be cowered from."

But such scorn may miss the point.

The attack was meant to send a broader message to the UK government, says Galeotti. The Russians believed Sergei Skripal, a former GRU officer who arrived in the UK with a pardon as a result of a spy swap in 2010, was active again -- with the connivance or encouragement of the UK intelligence services. And that -- to Moscow -- was out of order.

Whether the GRU proposed the operation or was directed to carry it out by the Kremlin will probably never be known, adds Galeotti. But he has no doubt that such an attack would have required a green light at a very high level.

Had such an audacious operation not been approved from above, there would have been consequences in the form of "unexpected retirements" at the GRU, Galeotti concludes. His sources suggest the agency remains "one of the favorite sons" of President Vladimir Putin.

Guccifer 2.0

The GRU has certainly been throwing its weight around in recent years and is an active participant in what the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, described in 2013 as a new form of warfare through "political, economic, informational, humanitarian, and other non-military measures."

That has included an enthusiastic embrace of cyber-warfare. Thomas Rid, currently a Professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told a US Senate panel last year that "by early 2015, GRU was targeting military and diplomatic entities at high tempo, especially defense attachés world-wide. Among the targets are numerous senior US military officers and defense civilians."

At the beginning of 2017, the US intelligence community released a report firmly tying the GRU to the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts in the previous year's US election campaign.

That report concluded: "We assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com " to distribute hacked material.

The operation had begun by March 2016, according to the declassified version of the report

Subsequently, the US Special Prosecutor's office, in a detailed indictment , identified 12 GRU officers as being involved in the hacking, saying that the "GRU had multiple units, including Units 26165 and 74455, engaged in cyber operations." Several of the officers used a GRU malware called X-Agent.

The indictment included the addresses in Moscow where these units worked, and the online aliases used by some of the officers. Prosecutors say they were also able to trace the hackers' lease of a server in Arizona and their inability on one occasion to connect to X-Agent.

Among other examples of careless tradecraft, according to the indictment, the GRU officers "operated the @dcleaks_ Twitter account from the same computer used for other efforts to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election."

Rid notes that the sort of hacking infrastructure repeatedly used by the GRU " allowed investigators to link the DNC breach to other breaches with high confidence, particularly to the German Bundestag hack" in 2015.

Again, it seems that results -- sowing disruption -- were more important than perfect tradecraft.

The Dutch intrusion

It's not only the GRU whose work has left fingerprints. Part of the US intelligence assessment early in 2017 appears to have been based on an extraordinary intrusion into the work of the Russian intelligence services by the Dutch agency AIVD.

While the agency itself won't comment on its works, Dutch and other media say the AIVD's Joint Sigint Cyber Unit penetrated the computer network at a university building next to Red Square in Moscow.

Later, according to a source familiar with Dutch operation, AIVD discovered the network was run by a Russian hacker group known as "Cozy Bear," which has been involved in multiple hacking attacks on governments and companies for more than a decade.

The Dutch analysts deduced that Cozy Bear was a creature of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR. It was their work that tipped off the US about Russia's foray into the 2016 election.

'Big boots'

The degree of cooperation and competition among Russian intelligence agencies ebbs and flows. Galeotti says the SVR and the domestic security service, the FSB, may share disdain for the "big boots" of the GRU, but it is unlikely any agency would actively impede the work of another.

Flowers and a teddy bear, left by parents of an Australian victim of the crash, laid on a piece of the Malaysia Airlines plane MH17 in eastern Ukraine.

The GRU has been an important player in eastern Ukraine, supporting the separatists with weapons procurement and training. Galeotti told CNN the GRU is ideally suited to acting in the region because it includes many former members of the Russian special forces, or Spetsnaz. The conflict in Ukraine was the perfect environment for an agency comfortable in lawless foreign regions and war zones. A number of former GRU officers have been sanctioned by the US Treasury for their activities in Ukraine and Crimea.

The agency was also linked to a failed attempt to overthrow Montenegro's government on the eve of parliamentary elections in October 2016. Montenegro's chief special prosecutors says Russia was involved in that plot and also one to kill the country's then prime minister. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations "absurd."

Galeotti believes the GRU was tasked with the effort in an attempt to prevent Montenegro from joining NATO. Within the last week, Estonia has arrested two men for supplying classified information and state secrets to the GRU over a period of five years, receiving undisclosed payments in return. One of them is a former artillery officer in the Estonian Defense Forces.

Whether the GRU has been effective with its "big boots" is open to question. The shooting down of MH17 rallied western governments behind a hard line on sanctions against Russia over its intervention in Ukraine. The Skripal affair united many governments in expelling Russian diplomats. Montenegro went ahead and joined NATO -- just what Russia didn't want.

Shortly before his death in 1952, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin convened a meeting to reorganize the country's intelligence services. According to historical accounts of that meeting , Stalin said: "In intelligence, one should never work by launching an attack up front. Intelligence should be active in a roundabout way. Otherwise there will be failures and serious failures."

The GRU seems to have adopted a different philosophy.
__label__world (CNN) They were a married couple who left their baby with grandma while they carried out the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since the December 2012 rampage at Sandy Hook .

Syed Rizwan Farook, a U.S. citizen, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik , a permanent resident, massacred 14 people at a holiday party Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California.

Farook and Malik were later killed in a shootout with police. The attackers' specific motives remain unclear, but here is what we know about them:

They were husband and wife

Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, were married.

He got to know Malik through an online dating service, Farook family attorney Mohammad Abuershaid said. They met face to face when Farook visited Saudi Arabia, where Malik had moved from her native Pakistan around the age of 18 or 20, according to the lawyer.

She later came to the United States on a fiancée visa and became a legal permanent resident.

This image of Syed Rizwan Farook appears on the dating site iMilap.com.

The couple left their 6-month-old girl with Farook's mother Wednesday, saying they had a doctor's appointment.

The grandmother became concerned when she saw reports of the shooting and couldn't reach Farook.

Farook worked for the county

Farook, an American citizen, was an environmental health specialist with the San Bernardino County health department, which was hosting the holiday party at the Inland Regional Center where the attack took place.

He had been there five years. Records list a man with his name and title who worked at the agency and made $53,000 in 2013.

He graduated from California State University, San Bernardino, with a degree in environmental health in 2010.

A graduate student ID card from California State University, Fullerton, with Farook's name on it was spotted by CNN on Friday inside his Redlands townhouse. Jeff Cook, a spokesman for that school, said that records indicate a student by that same name had been enrolled in Cal State Fullerton's environmental engineering graduate program.

The university issued a statement Friday saying, "Syed Rizwan Farook attended Cal State Fullerton for one semester in Fall 2014 in the online graduate program in environmental engineering. He is not currently enrolled."

Police haven't pinpointed a motive

Farook was at the party but left abruptly before the shooting. He seemed angry, witnesses told police. He returned. And, along with Malik, he went into the building and began firing, authorities said.

There are no indications his job was in jeopardy, police said. They're also unaware of any criminal history.

Farhan Khan, Farook's brother-in-law, told reporters he was at a loss, too.

"I have no idea why he would do something like this. I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself," Khan said.

He said the family, like the rest of America, will have to wait for the police investigation for answers.

Farook and Malik didn't appear to have left behind a note, a law enforcement official said.

He may have been radicalized

Law enforcement officials told CNN that Farook had been in touch via phone and social media with at least one person whom the FBI suspected of international terrorism. Officials wouldn't elaborate.

It appears Farook was radicalized, which contributed to his motive, though other things -- such as workplace grievances -- may have also played a role, other law enforcement sources said.

The officials said these contacts were not considered high-priority terrorism subjects. And it had been at least a few months since the last known communication, they said.

Neither Farook nor Malik were on any list of potentially radicalized people, and there are no clear ties to overseas terrorist groups as of now, officials said.

Farook's relatives knew him as conservative but didn't think he or his wife were extreme, according to the family's attorneys.

"He was a normal guy," Abuershaid said.

Sources: Malik posted allegiance to ISIS

As the attack was underway, investigators believe Malik expressed allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a Facebook post, three U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN.

Malik made the post on an account with a different name, one U.S. official said. The officials did not explain how they knew Malik was behind the message.

A law enforcement official said it appeared ISIS may have inspired the attack, but none of the officials said the terror group directed or ordered the attack.

"This is looking more and more like self-radicalization," one law enforcement official said.

Farook kept a low profile

Those who knew Farook described him as quiet.

"He's a little bit shy, a little bit withdrawn. He doesn't mix with people easily," said Mustafa Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside where Farook was a regular.

Doyle Miller, Farook's landlord, said he had "no cause for concern" when he rented out a townhouse to him in Redlands.

"He had no red flags whatsoever; everything checked out," Miller said. "He had good credit reports ... everything.

"We screen our people pretty good. It's unbelievable what's going on."

Farook's family knew him as someone who "always kept to himself," as did his wife, according to Abuershaid.

He enjoyed target practice

The shooting took place at the Inland Regional Center, where employees with the county health department were attending a holiday event. The two shooters -- Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik -- were fatally shot in a gun battle with police hours after the initial incident. Farook worked for the county health department.

Farook had a profile set up on iMilap.com, which describes itself as "a site for people with disabilities and second marriage."

The profile said he "enjoys working on vintage and modern cars, reads religious books, enjoys eating out sometimes."

It also said Farook "enjoys traveling and just hanging out in the backyard doing target practice with his younger sister and friends."

He would go to firing ranges by himself, said David S. Chesley, another lawyer for Farook's family.

A representative for iMilap told CNN Farook logged on just twice in 2010 and wasn't active after that. He didn't contact anyone, nor did anyone contact him, the site said.

He was devout in his faith

His father told the New York Daily News that Farook was religious.

"He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back," he said

Kuko, the Islamic Center director, said Farook would come to the center for morning and night prayers.

He shares the same name as his brother and father

It's important to note Farook's middle name -- Rizwan. His father also is named Syed Farook, as is his older brother. Like him, they have different middle names.

Farook and Malik 'came prepared' for the attack

The couple was "dressed in dark, kind of tactical gear," San Bernardino police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. They carried rifles and semiautomatic handguns.

Two handguns recovered have been traced to Farook. He purchased them legally three or four years ago, an official said. Two rifles were purchased by someone else, possibly a former roommate, also legally three or four years ago. Officials said they don't think that person had anything to do with the shooting.

"These were people that came prepared," Burguan said. "There had to have been some degree of planning that went into this."

They tried to cover their tracks

Two relatively new cellphones were found smashed and tossed in a garbage can near one of the crime scenes, law enforcement officials said. Officials suspect the phones were damaged to hide call histories.

A computer found at the couple's home was missing a hard drive. Investigators have subpoenaed email service providers to retrieve communications.

They had a bomb lab in their townhouse

Inside the garage of the couple's rented townhouse, authorities found 12 pipe bomb-type devices and hundreds of tools, many of which could be used to make improvised explosives.

Authorities also found thousands of round of ammunition.

They intended to inflict more damage

A bag believed to belong to the shooters was found inside Inland Regional's conference room. Inside, investigators found three rudimentary explosive devices packed with black powder and rigged to a remote-controlled toy car. The remote for the car was found inside the SUV where Farook and Malik were later killed, a law enforcement official said.

The pair planned to use the remote to detonate the explosives from a distance, the official said. Either it didn't work because of distance or they didn't do it. Officials later rendered the explosive devices safe.

They died in a hail of bullets

After carrying out the attack at Inland Regional, Farook and Malik led police on a chase. Farook fired at officers while Malik drove, officials said. They died in the shootout, which involved 21 officers.
__label__world (CNN) NATO has formally invited Montenegro to join the alliance, a move that's spurred threats from Russian officials at loggerheads with NATO over everything from Ukraine to Syria to Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane.

While it comes at a time of heightened tensions between NATO and Russia, it didn't happen out of the blue; it's the result of a process that began nine years ago.

"Today, we proudly receive a #NATO membership invitation," said Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic, according to his government's Twitter feed . "This is a historic day for #Montenegro. The most important (since) the 2006 (independence) referendum."

#Montenegro thanks @NATO allies for the invitation to join the Alliance. pic.twitter.com/h0mPirbKej

As expected, this celebratory sentiment wasn't echoed in Russia.

"Moscow has always noted at various levels that the continuing expansion of NATO and NATO's military infrastructure to the East, of course, cannot but lead to response actions from the East, namely, the Russian side in ensuring security interests and supporting the parity of interests," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the state-run Tass news agency

Peskov declined to say what Russian President Vladimir Putin will do about the Montenegro invitation, saying, "Now, there are other priorities."

But Viktor Ozerov, the chair of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security, told another state news agency that Russia will end military and technical cooperation with Montenegro if its membership becomes official.

"Montenegro should recognize that a lot of programs that have been previously realized by it with Russia ... will be impossible in the context of its NATO accession," Ozerov told RIA Novosti.

Kerry: 'NATO is not a threat to anybody'

Twenty-eight countries , from the United States and Canada on one side of the Atlantic to a host of nations on the other, currently make up NATO. Twelve have been part of the bloc since its inception in 1949, in the thick of the Cold War, as a bulwark against the then-Soviet Union, and its membership has expanded periodically since

Its biggest single push came in 2004 with the addition of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Albania and Croatia joined NATO five years later. Like Montenegro, all those countries are in Eastern Europe and have historic ties to Moscow.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry took pains Wednesday to point out that Montenegro's possible accession to NATO "is not new," having been in the works for years.

Still, Wednesday's announcement comes at a particularly strained time in NATO-Russia relations.

The two sides have been at odds over Ukraine , where protesters pushed out the president about two years ago because of his closeness to Russia. The country has been boiling ever since, with Kiev and its Western allies -- including NATO , even though Ukraine isn't a member -- blasting Moscow for annexing Crimea and fomenting unrest elsewhere, while Russia says it favors popular determination for Ukraine and downplays its military's role in armed conflict.

JUST WATCHED NATO's role in conflict between Turkey and Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NATO's role in conflict between Turkey and Russia 02:01

Another major area of contention is Syria. Putin has been one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's strongest (and few) allies in that country's bloody, years-long civil war, at a time when many, including U.S. President Barack Obama, have called for Assad's ouster and supported moderate rebels fighting him.

There have been many spillover effects from this conflict, the latest -- and most perilous to Russia-NATO relations -- coming when Turkey, a NATO member, shot down a Russian warplane . (Exactly where is a point of contention, with Moscow claiming the aircraft was struck in Syrian airspace and Ankara saying it was over Turkey. The nations also give conflicting reports on whether any warnings went out beforehand.)

That's why Montenegro joining NATO matters beyond that Balkan state: because it threatens to drive another wedge between Russia and the alliance. Kerry, though, said Wednesday that Moscow shouldn't worry.

"NATO is not a threat to anybody," he said after meetings at NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. "It's not an offensive organization. It is a defensive alliance. It is meant to simply provide security.

"And I don't think it's focused on Russia, per se, or anybody else."

Montenegro leader says move 'big' for Balkans region

Becoming an official member of NATO would be significant for Montenegro because, under the alliance's charter, any attack on it would be considered an attack on all NATO members. So if something were to play out the way it did in Ukraine -- where Russian troops are accused of taking part in armed conflict against government forces -- then NATO might be obliged to intervene on Montenegro's behalf.

No one is saying that will happen anytime soon. Still, the way Russian state media portrayed Wednesday's announcement speaks to Moscow's firm opposition.

The Tass report described what it called "a major propaganda campaign advertising NATO" by powers-that-be in Montenegro. Another story, from Sputnik news , referred to "ongoing anti-government protests with thousands of citizens gathering in ... the country's capital, Podgorica, to demand that Montenegro stay out of the U.S.-led NATO military bloc."

"Obviously, it is a political project not in the real interests of the citizens of Montenegro," Sputnik quoted a representative of the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro.

U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, stressed Wednesday to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that "nations come to us and ask to be a part of NATO and we absolutely support every nation's individual right to seek its own individual destiny."

"The timing is right," Breedlove, the head of U.S. European Command, said of Montenegro's NATO invitation. "I don't think that we should allow Russia a veto over who wants to become a part of our alliance."

Montenegro is already involved in NATO's efforts in Afghanistan and has actively cooperated with the alliance in other ways.

The country has also enacted several reforms to meet the alliance's requirements, though Stoltenberg said NATO still expects more progress "on defense adaptation, on domestic reform, especially rule of law, and to continue to make progress in demonstrating public support for Montenegro's NATO membership."

Djukanovic, the Montenegrin Prime Minister, signaled Wednesday that his government is even more intent now on pursuing such reforms.

He also expressed hope the announcement would lead to broader changes elsewhere in his region.

"Inviting #Montenegro (is a) big day for W. Balkans," the Montenegrin government tweeted, citing Djukanovic. "I believe this is wind in (the) sails for reform and integration processes in region."
__label__world (CNN) Migrant women waiting to be reunited with their children have been held in legal limbo for days, technically "released" from ICE custody but not allowed to leave, immigration attorneys and witnesses tell CNN.

Multiple female detainees at the Port Isabel Detention Center, near the southern tip of Texas, have been officially processed for release but continue to be held without explanation at the facility, according to immigration attorneys and witnesses.

The accounts from inside the ICE-run facility in Los Fresnos, Texas, include women who say that for days they have only been given bread to eat while they wait to be reunited with their children. Others have said the food is adequate.

The women have been moved to a separate barracks where they wait in civilian clothing, officially released but not allowed leave, according to attorneys and witnesses.

"They just tell us 'soon, soon, soon' when we ask if we'll be able to talk to our children," a Port Isabel detainee named Carol told CNN in a phone call on Sunday. She asked that we not use her full name.

Carol, 30, told CNN she has been at Port Isabel since crossing into the country illegally from Honduras on June 2. Conditions at the detention center, she says, have become incrementally worse over the last two months.

"Where they're holding us to be processed is freezing. It's so cold some of us are having trouble breathing," she says.

Carol says her 7-year-old son is being held in the Cayuga Centers, a nonprofit in New York where many migrant children have been detained while they wait to be reunited with their parents.

The government's response

Hundreds of parents are in the process of being reunited with children that the government took from them at the border. Some of the families have been separated for weeks or months. A federal judge in California has ordered that separated families in immigration detention be reunited by Thursday.

The strange limbo seems to be a function of the hurried effort to reunite more than 2,500 children in government custody by the Thursday deadline after they were identified with roughly two weeks to go.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which manages the detention centers, and Health and Human Services, which cares for the separated children, did not fully explain to CNN after multiple inquiries why these women would be waiting in this transitional state for so long. Nor did they respond to the allegations about the conditions.

In a statement provided to CNN by ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez, the agency referenced "logistical challenges" presented by large-scale transfers. She also said the agencies were prioritizing the children's wellbeing.

"DHS and HHS are working tirelessly to reunite parents and children within the court ordered timeline," the statement said.

"In order to facilitate more efficient reunification of family units going forward, ICE has leveraged additional resources to enhance processing capacity for adults/parents held in the Port Isabel Detention Center (PIDC). The safety and well-being of children remains our top priority as we work to comply with the court's order as expeditiously as possible."

While the statement did not address some of the specific concerns raised by attorneys and witnesses at PIDC, it added that "on average" most children brought to PIDC for transfer to DHS custody by HHS are "reunified with their parents within a few hours of their arrival."

An ICE official acknowledged that from July 15 to 16 there were some children who had to sleep in the Port Isabel Detention Center overnight. That facility is not a family detention center, so children are not supposed to stay there that long. Since then, the official said, ICE has ensured no child has spent more than a few hours waiting to be reunited with their parents.

Attorney: My clients feel like they're 'being held hostage'

Government attorneys and officials have said in court that once a child and parent are both cleared for release, their reunion should happen within a day or two at most. But the reunions do not seem to be occurring as planned.

In at least one case, a woman who was processed for release on Wednesday still had not been released as of Monday morning, according to immigration attorney Eileen Blessinger. The woman spoke with CNN on Wednesday and said she had been told she would be reunited with her young son that day.

Other immigration attorneys recounted similar stories.

Immigration attorney Thelma Garcia says her clients feel as though they are "being held hostage."

Garcia told CNN one of her clients inside Port Isabel told her, "I have not spoken to my child in almost two weeks." According to Garcia, the client also said, "the phones don't work here where we are at."

Multiple female detainees have told their attorneys or CNN that in their transitional state, they no longer have ways to communicate with the outside world.

Garcia's client was moved to a holding barracks at PIDC and was told that her 14-year-old son was only 40 minutes away at a shelter and that they would be reunited. The client told Garcia she is still waiting.

"There's no word yet on when the reunion will happen," Garcia told CNN.

Attorney Abiel Garcia says his clients have also been kept in limbo.

"We were able to meet with [our client] on Friday and she was in civilian clothing. But as of today, she is still being held at the detention center, though she has been processed for release," Abiel Garcia told CNN Sunday evening.

"It's shocking to see this happening when parents were already being released," he said. "It's shocking to have a client sitting and waiting at a detention center, not able to call me."
__label__world Berlin (CNN) Migration could be a "make or break" issue for the European Union, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an impassioned speech Thursday ahead of a critical EU summit.

She pressed the German Parliament to back a tough but humane asylum and migration policy for the European Union, warning that if Germany fails to support that, migration issues could define Europe's destiny.

The crunch point comes at a time when Europe is already dealing with a lingering debt crisis, a rise in European populism , an escalating trade war with the United States , questions over Washington's commitment to NATO and faltering negotiations for Brexit.

EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for a European Council summit that was supposed to focus on Brexit. Instead, with little progress on that front and high-profile disagreements over the fate of migrants rescued at sea , migration has come to the fore.

In a striking appeal to her own parliament for European solidarity, Merkel unpicked some of the most contentious problems pitting members of the European Union against each other.

"Those who come to Europe cannot choose which EU country they want to seek asylum in," she said. "Secondly, we cannot leave those countries where asylum seekers arrive to deal with (the problem) alone.

"If we do not get an agreement with the 28 EU member states, we will then need to consider a coalition of the willing on migrant policy. We need to find better solutions."

Macron urges European solution

French President Emmanuel Macron echoed Merkel's message of cooperation as he arrived for the summit in Brussels.

"This subject is now not new," he said. "This has been a live issue in Europe since 2015. There is one alternative that I want to propose today: Do you want a national solution or a European solution which is cooperative?"

Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk urged EU leaders to focus on the bloc's external border, including a proposal for so-called "regional disembarkation platforms" outside Europe to help stop the flow of migrants attempting perilous sea crossings.

Europe's cooperation with third parties had already helped to reduce the migration flow by 96% since 2015, Tusk said.

"The alternative to this solution would be a chaotically advancing closure of borders, also within the EU, as well as growing conflicts among EU member states," he said.

"Some may think I am too tough in my proposals on migration. But trust me, if we don't agree on them, then you will see some really tough proposals from some really tough guys."

One of those taking a hardline approach to migrants entering Europe is Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. "The invasion should be stopped. And to stop the invasion means to have strong border control, and we have that," he said as he arrived in Brussels.

Orban, who also opposes the quota system to redistribute migrants across EU countries, said the bloc must deliver "what the people really request" on migration in order to restore European democracy.

Hungary's Parliament passed a law last week that criminalizes helping undocumented immigrants , including asylum seekers.

Merkel: A new way

Speaking earlier in Berlin, Merkel advised against states acting unilaterally on migration, insisting that Europe needs to remain true to its multilateral values. It's an approach that can be seen as the polar opposite of US President Donald Trump's "America First" message.

"My maxim is: Not unilateral, not without consent, but with the consent of partner states," said Merkel. "Which is precisely what we have been discussing in the last few weeks. And what I will be talking about when I return. It will not be perfect. But it is the beginning of a new way."

She argued that Germany's so-called open door migration policy in 2015 -- when more than 1 million migrants entered Germany -- was an exceptional event and a decision that Germany did not make on its own.

"Our decision to open doors to refugees in 2015 was not unilateral. We acted to help Austria and Hungary," she said.

Merkel also pointed out that the number of asylum seekers coming to Europe had fallen dramatically and that it was now time for Europe to return to the migration policy it had before 2015.

Germany would push to strengthen Europe's external borders as well as seek agreements with African nations "similar to the agreement made with Turkey" on the return of rejected asylum seekers, she said.

Merkel conceded that her Interior Minister Horst Seehofer was right to push for a plan that reduces irregular migration and that high-profile criminal cases involving asylum seekers showed the need for tougher deportations.

"We are not yet where we want to be," she said.

Seehofer -- whose disagreements with Merkel over migration briefly threatened to bring down her government earlier this month -- was not present for the speech. A German Interior Ministry spokeswoman told CNN he had "other appointments to take care of."

By making this speech before, rather than after, the summit Merkel may hope to have taken the wind from the sails of her hardline critics such as Seehofer.

Tusk: 'Time is short'

In an invitation letter sent to EU leaders ahead of the summit, Tusk said a failure to ensure full control of Europe's external borders risked strengthening the hand of newly emerging populist political movements.

"More and more people are starting to believe that only strong-handed authority, anti-European and anti-liberal in spirit, with a tendency towards overt authoritarianism, is capable of stopping the wave of illegal migration," he said.

"If people believe them, that only they can offer an effective solution to the migration crisis, they will also believe anything else they say. The stakes are very high. And time is short."

Tusk also sounded a warning over Trump in the wake of the G7 summit in Canada , where deep divisions between the United States and its allies in Europe were laid bare, and ahead of a key NATO summit next month.

"Despite our tireless efforts to keep the unity of the West, transatlantic relations are under immense pressure due to the policies of President Trump," said Tusk.

"Unfortunately, the divisions go beyond trade. I will share with you my political assessment of where things stand. It is my belief that, while hoping for the best, we must be ready to prepare our Union for worst-case scenarios."
__label__world Tehran, Iran (CNN) The United States is addicted to applying sanctions on Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Sunday in an exclusive interview from Tehran.

"I believe there is a disease in the United States and that is the addiction to sanctions," he told CNN, adding that, "Even during the Obama administration the United States put more emphasis on keeping the sanctions it had not lifted rather than implementing its obligation on the sanctions it lifted."

The interview is the first the key architect of the complex nuclear deal between Iran and the West has given to Western media since some of the US sanctions against Iran were renewed last week. The US-educated minister gave the interview in fluent English on the 65th anniversary of a US-backed coup that overthrew democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.

Zarif retained a clear belief during the hourlong interview in the foreign ministry that the nuclear deal could be revived regardless of the Trump administration denunciation of it. In May, Trump withdrew from the deal, known as the JCPOA and intended to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief, calling it a "horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made." The first wave of sanctions that were to "snap back" under the Trump move hit the import of car parts and precious metals on August 6.

Putin dropped in on Karin Kneissl's wedding in a remote area of southern Austria, on his way to a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in neighboring Germany later that day.

The Russian president was pictured dancing with Kneissl, who was dressed in a traditional "dirndl" dress, in a vineyard in Styria province.

Putin arrived with a bouquet of flowers and even brought a Cossack choir with him to entertain the bride and her groom, the entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS.

Mnangagwa was sworn in Sunday after his contested win in the July 30 presidential election. Main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa contested his loss in court, describing the election as "fraudulent and illegal. The judge dismissed the case Friday and upheld Mnangagwa's victory.

Zimbabwe anti-riot police personnel deploy Friday at the Bronte Hotel in Harare.

A few days after Mnangagwa's victory at the polls, Zimbabwe's security forces descended on opposition leaders.

Zimbabwean forces opened fire on unarmed protesters in Harare's streets. President Mnangagwa called for a public inquiry and accused the opposition of inciting the protests.

__label__world Pyeongchang, South Korea (CNN) North Korea is sending another high-level delegation to South Korea for the Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony this Sunday, led by a man widely believed to have masterminded the sinking of a South Korean navy ship that killed 46 sailors.

Kim Yong Chol, Vice Chairman of the Party Central Committee, will lead the delegation that's due to arrive by land on the Gyeongui rail line hours before the ceremony starts, according to a statement Thursday from the South's Ministry of Unification.

A giant floating crane lifts the stern of the 1,200-tonne sunken Cheonan to place it on a barge, before returning it to South Korea, April 15, 2010.

Kim is the former chief of the North's Reconnaissance Bureau, a top military intelligence body blamed by Seoul for a torpedo attack that sunk the South Korean warship Cheonan, in 2010.

The choice of Kim to lead the delegation is likely to be interpreted as an intentional provocation. Kim is named on the list of individuals sanctioned by both the US and South Korea. The US sanctions include provisions intended to restrict movement, though it is not clear whether Kim's trip to the South is in breach of travel-specific sanctions.

The announcement poses a renewed diplomatic challenge for hosts South Korea, who in addition to navigating issues relating to sanctions, will again need to accommodate both the North Korean and US delegations, without offending either party.

__label__world (CNN) Two years ago, Myanmar celebrated a moment many thought would never come as democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi took her seat at the head of the country's new government .

Suu Kyi and outgoing President Thein Sein were feted around the world for helping transition the country from military junta to semi-democracy, and the reputation of "The Lady" was higher than ever.

Today, her image around the world is in tatters, marred by her perceived mishandling of the Rohingya crisis, which has seen hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim ethnic minority people flee a brutal crackdown by the military in northwestern Rakhine state.

Suu Kyi's transformation from democracy icon to figure of disdain reached a new stage this week, when one of Suu Kyi's strongest backers in the West publicly broke with her , denouncing her asout of touch, fearful of the military and reluctant to confront the human rights crisis unfolding in her own country.

Former US ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson, who has known Suu Kyi for over 30 years and visited her during her lengthy period of house arrest, told CNN this week "she's changed, she's become, unfortunately, a politician afraid of the military and afraid to make the tough decisions to resolve one of the worst humanitarian crises in history."

"(She doesn't) want to hear bad news, and I think that's what's happened to her, to my friend," he said. "Well, maybe former friend because I'm sure she doesn't consider me a friend."

In a statement Friday, Suu Kyi's office said she sacked Richardson, accusing him of attempting to "pursue his own agenda."

"In view of the difference of opinion that developed, the government decided that his continued participation on the (advisory) board would not be the best interest of all concerned," the statement said.

Prior to that statement, a spokesman for Suu Kyi told CNN "we are very sorry about Mr Richardson's resignation."

'Circus of commissions'

Until this week, Richardson was on a board tasked with implementing the recommendations of a commission helmed by former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.

Annan's commission highlighted a number of major issues in Rakhine State which led to the current crisis, though Suu Kyi appeared to rebut several of them in a public speech on the Rohingya issue

"There's a long history of the establishment of commissions that essentially serve to whitewash human rights violations in Rakhine state," said Matthew Smith, co-founder of the Thailand-based Fortify Rights.

"Among the circus of commissions over many years, the Annan commission was a rare exception" in that it produced actionable suggestions and criticism of government policies, he said.

Richardson however has accused the board he was on of dragging its feet, of becoming a "cheerleading squad for government policy as opposed to proposing genuine policy changes that are desperately needed."

Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said he has resigned from an advisory panel trying to tackle the massive Rohingya refugee crisis, Wednesday, January 24, 2018, in Yangon, Myanmar.

Contentious issue

The Rohingya issue is one of the most controversial in Myanmar and has plagued the country, also known as Burma, for decades.

While many of the mostly Muslim ethnic group can trace their lineage in Myanmar back centuries, the majority Bamar population regards them as "Bengali" interlopers, and they have been consistently denied citizenship or legal status.

Prejudice against the Rohingya -- a word many Burmese won't even use -- is widespread across all levels of society , including within the country's elite and pro-democracy parties.

"Much of the hatred and discrimination against the Rohingya population has been cultivated over many years," said Smith.

"Suu Kyi and her moral leadership could have gone a long way to unpack and unravel that ... instead (she's) actually perpetrated many of the stereotypes and anti-Muslim and anti-Rohingya discrimination."

As Francis Wade writes in " Myanmar's Enemy Within: Buddhist Violence and the Making of a Muslim Other ," even before the latest crisis "Suu Kyi was often accused of harboring a possible (anti-Muslim) bias of her own, for she was an elite Bamar and thus a beneficiary of the ethnic hierarchy that had formed in Myanmar."

She notoriously dismissed concerns about rising violence against Rohingya in a 2013 interview , saying Buddhists in Rakhine live in fear of "global Muslim power."

According to Matthew Mullen , an expert in Myanmar politics at the Institute of Human Rights and Peace Studies at Thailand's Mahidol University, the transition from military rule gave an opening for "xenophobic forces ... to target, attack and exclude, turning the transition into a cleansing project" aimed at hated ethnic minorities.

Smith said the risk is "very high that violence could spread to other areas," with more than 130 ethnic groups in Myanmar, including major non-Buddhist communities who have historically been oppressed.

Siege mentality

The intense international criticism of the government's handling of the Rohingya crisis has in turn created something of a siege mentality in Myanmar.

According to Richardson, Suu Kyi has reacted to the ongoing criticism by surrounding herself with "sycophants" and refusing to listen to bad news.

There is a "power bubble that has been created around her," filled with people who "tell her how great things are," he said. "She needs to start listening to her friends, people like me that are giving her frank advice that things are not going well, but she doesn't seem to want to hear this."

The majority of Burmese are still fans of Suu Kyi, with some telling CNN after a speech late last year the international criticism had only increased their support for her.

"Suu Kyi has got many supporters who are so thoroughly biased in favor of (her) that when she is criticized it does make them recoil and have firmer stances," Smith said.

Suu Kyi and her supporters meanwhile have accused the international press of exaggerating the crisis and constructing a " huge iceberg of misinformation " which is negatively affecting her ability to run the country.

A breaking point for Richardson was Suu Kyi's handling of the detention of two Reuters journalists who are being charged under colonial-era secrecy laws.

As a former political prisoner herself, Richardson felt Suu Kyi should have a greater understanding for the men's plight and that of their families.

"I reminded her that years ago I helped release a lot of polifical prisoners in Myanmar, including herself from house arrest and some of her allies, and here's a case where she's objecting and lashing out at me for trying to get the two journalists out," he said.

Richardson said he wouldn't go as far to back calls for Suu Kyi to be stripped of her Nobel Peace Prize, but he said he hoped his resignation would be a "wake-up call to her that she's got to change."

"This is not the Aung San Suu Kyi that I've known was a beacon of democracy and Nobel Prize Winner. She's changed and she needs to change back."
__label__world (CNN) Thousands of Venezuelans fleeing the economic and humanitarian crisis roiling their homeland are facing increasing hostility from their South American neighbors.

Stricter border rules and mob violence have greeted some migrants as they look for refuge from the chaotic situation in Venezuela.

The mass exodus is ratcheting up tensions in countries such as Peru, Ecuador and Brazil even as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announces the introduction of "a magic formula" to get his country back on track.

Brazil announced Sunday it would deploy 120 men from the country's national force to the border state of Roraima, where hostility towards Venezuelan migrants recently boiled over.

On Saturday, a mob of Brazilians attacked a group of Venezuelans in a border city and destroyed a migrant camp after a local business owner was robbed by Venezuelans, according to Brazil's state run news outlet, Agencia Brasil. Around 1,200 Venezuelan migrants fled back over the border after the attack.

A judge had earlier ruled to prohibit the entry of all Venezuelans to the state but the decision was overturned by Brazil's supreme court

The Brazilian government has said it is committed to helping Venezuelans and will continue to try to spread migrants throughout various states in the country.

The Venezuelan government issued a statement asking the Brazilian government to "take measures to safeguard and secure" Venezuelan citizens, "their families and belongings."

Ecuador and Peru announce restrictive measures

Venezuelan citizens wait in line to cross to Ecuador at the Rumichaca international bridge in Ipiales, Colombia, on August 11, 2018.

Meanwhile, a new rule came into effect in Ecuador Saturday requiring Venezuelan citizens entering the country to present a valid passport. Previously, Ecuador accepted other forms of identification.

CNN was present at the border and spoke to some of the migrants. Many were caught by surprise, having started their journeys before the measure went into effect.

"My family is fragmented, destroyed. We're no longer together," one Venezuelan migrant told CNN Sunday. "My son is in Peru, my daughter in Chile, I have yet another daughter who's on her way to Poland. Give me a break! When will I get them all together again? My wife is in Venezuela. The situation is dire."

On Sunday as Ecuador's Interior Ministry relaxed the identification rule slightly, saying on Twitter that the law allows for children and adolescents to not present their passport "as long as both parents have it and show their relationship of filiation and kinship."

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says more than half a million Venezuelans have crossed into Ecuador via Colombia since the start of the year and that the number is accelerating with some 30,000 entering in the first week of August alone.

The government has declared a state of emergency in human mobility in three provinces, meaning it can assign additional resources to Venezuelans.

Ecuador is both a destination and transit point for Venezuelans escaping the humanitarian crisis in their own country. Some of the migrants are also heading towards Peru and countries further south.

The Peruvian government has followed Ecuador's lead, announcing Saturday that beginning August 25, Venezuelan citizens who want to enter Peru can do so only with a valid passport.

Once land of opportunity

It is a reversal of fortunes for Venezuela, which was once the richest country in Latin America and a destination of choice for those fleeing turmoil in the region during the 1970s and 80s.

Colombians fleeing civil war, Peruvians fleeing the political and economic instability under Alberto Fujimori and Chileans fleeing the Pinochet dictatorship sought refuge in the oil-rich country, which was seen as a land of opportunity.

An economic crisis is driving the current mass migration out of Venezuela, where residents now live with food shortages, overcrowded hospitals, inflation and political turmoil.

For now, the exodus shows no sign of slowing.

Venezuelans filed 117,000 asylum claims in the first six months of this year, surpassing the total number of claims made in 2017, according to the UNHCR.

"The exodus of Venezuelans from the country is one of Latin America's largest mass-population movements in history," UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said in a statement. "Many of the Venezuelans are moving on foot, in an odyssey of days and even weeks in precarious conditions."

What is Venezuela's government doing?

On Friday, President Nicolas Maduro announced new economic measures to go into effect starting Monday -- -- including a 60-fold increase in the minimum wage that will being to take effect on September 1.

Maduro said the government will provide assistance on the minimum wage increase for 90 days but employers are nervous they won't have enough money to pay their staff.

The President also announced that the government was removing five zeroes from the Venezuelan currency -- dropping the Bolivar's value more than 90%. The currency will be pegged to a cryptocurrency called the petro.

Venezuela plans to roll out a new currency Monday, the "Bolivar Soberano," which will be worth 100,000 "old" Bolivares and was created to simplify transactions in the hyperinflationary Venezuelan economy.

Maduro made a Facebook Live address on Sunday, saying, "We are going through a re-balancing process.

"This does not happen overnight," he said. "This re-balancing process will be developed. This is a magic formula that is truly impressive. That we discovered through our own thoughts and analysis."

A bank holiday was declared Monday out of the blue, with banks remaining closed even as the new currency was to take effect.

Explaining the measures on national television Sunday night, Maduro said: "This is a really impressive, magic formula that we discovered while studying with our own, Venezuelan, Latin American-rooted thinking."

The latest announcements caused merchants to close their doors over the weekend, not knowing how to reflect the new currency in their pricing. Shoppers, on the other hand, rushed to supermarkets and gas stations that remained open.

The International Monetary Fund says Venezuela's inflation may hit 1 million percent by the end of the year.

Amidst the chaos, there have been attempts on Maduro's life. Two high-ranking military officers were detained earlier this month in connection with an alleged drone attack against Maduro. The government said drones armed with explosives flew toward the president as he spoke at a military parade.

Maduro has accused opposition groups of orchestrating the August 4 failed attack and claimed the "financiers and planners" of the operation live in Florida.

Kabul, Afghanistan — Journalists, editors and producers gather for an editorial meeting in a coral painted building in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.

The day's agenda? Women.

This is the office of Zan TV — made for and run entirely by women.

Zan, which means "woman" in the Dari language, is the first media outlet of its kind in Afghanistan, which was under Taliban rule from 1996 until 2001

During that time, women's rights all but disappeared. Journalism and access to education for women were banned under the regime.

In the 16 years since the fall of the Taliban, women have gradually moved back into important societal and professional roles. Yet the knock-on effect of a country marred by war and conflict continues to be felt across important public-facing sectors — including journalism.

The number of female journalists has been declining in recent years, particularly in the last two, according to a survey released by the Centre of Afghan Women Journalists in November. The report found that 1,037 women work in media outlets.

Zan TV is hoping it can help change that, by giving women not only more visibility on camera but also the power to investigate and report on important issues facing women.

"The happiest moment of my life is when I report the facts visually, talk about challenges that women face in our society," says Shogofa Sidiqui, a chief reporter at the station.

Although Sidiqui understands women might be fighting an uphill battle in journalism — with insecurity and the threat of violence a constant -- she is hopeful that Zan TV will inspire young women to follow their dreams.

"They have to show their courage and ability to be a role model as women for other women in [the] future."

(CNN) Many scientists say it's abundantly clear that Earth is entering its sixth mass-extinction event, meaning three-quarters of all species could disappear in the coming centuries.

That's terrifying, especially since humans are contributing to this shift.

But that's not even the full picture of the "biological annihilation" people are inflicting on the natural world, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Gerardo Ceballos, an ecology professor at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and his co-authors, including well-known Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich, cite striking new evidence that populations of species we thought were common are suffering in unseen ways.

"What is at stake is really the state of humanity," Ceballos told CNN.

Their key findings: Nearly one-third of the 27,600 land-based mammal, bird, amphibian and reptile species studied are shrinking in terms of their numbers and territorial range. The researchers called that an "extremely high degree of population decay."

The scientists also looked at a well-studied group of 177 mammal species and found that all of them had lost at least 30% of their territory between 1900 and 2015; more than 40% of those species "experienced severe population declines," meaning they lost at least 80% of their geographic range during that time.

Looking at the extinction crisis not only in terms of species that are on the brink but also those whose populations and ranges are shrinking helps show that "Earth's sixth mass extinction is more severe" than previously thought, the authors write. They say a major extinction event is "ongoing."

"It's the most comprehensive study of this sort to date that I'm aware of," said Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford University, who was not involved in the study. Its value, Barnosky said, is that it makes visible a phenomenon typically unseen by scientists and the public: that even populations of relatively common species are crashing.

"We've got this stuff going on that we can't really see because we're not constantly counting numbers of individuals," he said. "But when you realize that we've wiped out 50% of the Earth's wildlife in the last 40 years, it doesn't take complicated math to figure out that, if we keep cutting by half every 40 years, pretty soon there's going to be nothing left."

Stuart Pimm, chair of conservation ecology at Duke University in North Carolina, summed up the the concept this way: "When I look out over the woods that constitute my view from my window here, I know we no longer have wolves or panthers or black bears wandering around. We have eliminated a lot of species from a lot of areas. So we no longer have a functional set of species across large parts of the planet."

This is an important point to emphasize, Pimm said. But the new paper's analysis risks overstating the degree to which extinction events already are occurring, he said, and the research methodology does not have the level of granularity needed to be particularly useful for conservationists.

"What good mapping does is to tell you where you need to act," Pimm said. "The value of the Ceballos paper is a sense of the problem. But given there's a problem, what the bloody hell are we going to do about it?"

Often, scientists who study crisis in the natural world focus on species that are at high and short-term risk for extinction. These plants and animals tend to be odd and unfamiliar, often restricted to one island or forest. You probably didn't notice, for example, that the Catarina pupfish, native to Mexico, went extinct in 2014, according to the paper. Or that a bat called the Christmas Island pipistrelle is thought to have vanished in 2009.

Meanwhile, as this research shows, entire populations of other plants and animals are crashing, even if they're not yet on the brink of extinction. Some of these are well-known.

Consider the African elephant. "On the one hand, you can say, 'All right, we still have around 400,000 elephants in Africa, and that seems like a really big number,' " Barnosky said. "But then, if you step back, that's cut by more than half of what their populations were in the early part of last century. There were well over 1 million elephants (then).

"And if you look at what's happened in the last decade, we have been culling their numbers so fast that if we kept up with that pace, there would be no more wild elephants in Africa in 20 years."

Twenty years. No more African elephants. Think about that.

Barn swallows and jaguars are two other examples, according to Ceballos, the lead author of the paper. Both are somewhat common in terms of their total numbers, he said, but their decline is troubling in some places.

Such population crashes can, of course, lead to inevitable extinctions. And currently, scientists say that species are going extinct at roughly 100 times what would be considered normal -- perhaps considerably more.

There has been some dispute lately about whether the Earth's sixth mass extinction event already has begun or is simply on the horizon, but there is little disagreement among scientists that humans are driving an unprecedented ecological crisis.

All of this is contributing to a rapid decline in wild creatures, both on land and in the ocean.

Ceballos' paper highlights the urgency of this crisis -- and the need for change.

"The good news is, we still have time," he said. "These results show it is time to act. The window of opportunity is small, but we can still do something to save species and populations."

Otherwise, "biological annihilation" continues.
__label__world Auckland, New Zealand (CNN) New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says she was not rattled by an Australian interviewer who commented on her attractiveness and asked about the date of conception of her unborn child.

The interview by Charles Wooley for "60 Minutes" aired Sunday night on Australia's Channel 9 and unleashed a storm of controversy on social media, with some users deeming it sexist.

Ardern, 37, announced in January that she was pregnan t. She said she and her partner, Clarke Gayford, found out in October, during negotiations to form a minority New Zealand government.

"There is one really important political question I want to ask you, and that is, what exactly is the date the baby's due? " Wooley asked, during the "60 Minutes" interview. "It's interesting how much people have been counting back to the conception, as it were," he said.

Wooley later said: "I've met a lot of prime ministers in my time, but none so young, not too many so smart, and never one so attractive."

State broadcaster Radio New Zealand reported that Ardern told media that she had not found the interview sexist or insulting.

"Maybe it's just that I'm from Morrinsville. I don't know. I just wasn't particularly fazed by any of it," it quoted her as saying. Morrinsville is a small town on New Zealand's North Island where Ardern grew up.

Ardern said she didn't regard the question about the baby's conception date as offensive but said it might have been classed as "a little too much information."

Wooley later told New Zealand talkback station Newstalk ZB that he was surprised at the "Orwellian" reaction to the interview, adding that it was "not a good time to be a journalist."

"If you say someone is attractive ... I think you should relist 'attractive' in the thesaurus, about 50 choices from good looking to gorgeous to likeable -- there's so many different meanings," he said. "I'm going with winning. Winning is one of the alternatives in my directory."

Woolley told NewstalkZB his wife had thought he had been a too "gushing" but that everyone was "smitten by a wonderful prime minister."

60 Minutes is outdated, superficial tosh.

Expecting an in-depth, respectful interview of Jacinda Ardern was naive.

What actually happened was revolting.#auspol https://t.co/HWpOBTGjvX — Rachel Baker (@RachelBkr) February 26, 2018

"I know that some people in New Zealand might be annoyed that we didn't talk about housing, or university fees but -- this is an absolutely shocking thing to say -- but Australian audiences aren't very interested in the minutiae of New Zealand politics."

He said that Ardern had not appeared to be uncomfortable during the interview and that he did not regret asking about the date of conception.

Hey NZ this is you.

"Between you and me, I do get paid to do this and my executive producer would've sacked me if I hadn't asked that," he said. "I thought it was a funny point and obviously it wasn't in New Zealand -- we're culturally different."

Gayford -- a fishing show host -- appeared to post a cryptic reference to the interview on Twitter Monday, posting scenic coastal shots with the message: "A perfect place to escape for 60 Minutes or longer where required. Yesterday, Mokohinau Islands. Bloody magic bro."

__label__world (CNN) Authorities in Papua New Guinea are assessing the damage after a magnitude-7.5 earthquake struck the Pacific country early Monday.

The US Geological Survey said the quake hit at 3:45 a.m. local time (12:45 p.m. ET Sunday) near Porgera, northwest of the capital Port Moresby. It was 35 kilometers deep.

"The National Government has dispatched disaster assessment teams to parts of Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province following an earthquake in the early hours of this morning," Chief Secretary to Government Isaac Lupari said in a statement.

"The National Disaster Centre is working with provincial authorities to assess any damage and impacts on service delivery in the area. The Papua New Guinea Defence Force has also been mobilized to assist with the assessment and the delivery of assistance to affected people as well as the restoration of services and infrastructure," the statement said.

Lupari warned residents to be aware of potential aftershocks: "It is advisable to stay out of multistory buildings, to be aware of the potential of landslides, and to be prepared to move to open ground in the event that an aftershock is felt."

__label__world Beijing (CNN) One of China's former highest-ranking Buddhist monks sexually harassed nuns, China's top religious regulator said Thursday, just weeks after he strongly denied the accusations against him.

In a statement posted online, the National Religious Affairs Administration (NRAA) said its investigation found Shi Xuecheng had sent sexually explicit messages to multiple women.

In a 95-page document submitted to Chinese authorities in July, two monks at Beijing's Longquan Temple accused the 51-year-old of sexually harassing and assaulting multiple nuns, leaving at least one victim suicidal

Following the investigation, the NRAA ordered the Buddhist Association of China to severely punish Xuecheng, who stepped down as head of the religious body last week.

Investigators also discovered numerous irregularities in the running of Beijing's Longquan Temple, where Xuecheng was the long-time abbot, including illegal constructions and missing funds.

The NRAA statement added allegations Xuecheng committed sexual assault have been reported to the police, who are now investigating.

Explosive allegations

Xuecheng, who has taken a vow of celibacy like most Buddhist monks, released a brief statement denying all allegations when the scandal first emerged in early August. He has not commented on the latest developments.

The explosive report compiled by the two monks contained numerous examples of explicit messages Xuecheng allegedly sent to at least six nuns. In the messages, the sender demands total obedience from the women, including sexual favors, as part of their study of Buddhist doctrines.

It also included accounts from a number of the alleged victims, some of whom said they were so devastated by their experiences they became mentally unstable.

According to the document, which circulated widely online before being censored, one victim eventually reported the matter to Beijing police in June, alleging Xuecheng had sexually assaulted her and several other nuns.

Shi Xianqi, one of the two monks behind the original document, which also includes allegations of corruption, told CNN earlier this month that he and co-author Shi Xianjia stood by their words and were cooperating with the authorities. It is customary for Buddhist monks in China to adopt the family name Shi.

In a statement to CNN at the time, Xianqi described how he began investigating the abbot earlier this year when a "fearful and nervous" nun told him about the explicit messages she had been receiving.

"So many faithful Buddhist women wanted to join the temple and I always voted yes," he said. "Little did I know I was sending them to the tiger's mouth."

"The abbot's learned image has crumbled in my mind," he added. "All that's left is huge fear. He is evil in the Buddha's robe."

High-profile religious leader

China boasts more than 240 million Buddhists despite the ruling Communist Party being officially atheist.

Shi Xuecheng was considered one of the most high-profile religious leaders in the country, penning numerous books and traveling around the world to promote Chinese Buddhism.

He had been known to put a modern twist on the ancient religion, maintaining an active online presence and teaching Buddhist ideas through cartoons. In 2016, he attracted brief worldwide attention when his temple launched a humanoid "robot monk" designed to greet young visitors.

His temple has also been viewed as an intellectual bastion with highly educated young monks. Both of the whistleblowers hold doctorate degrees in engineering from one of China's most prestigious universities.

The scandal comes at a time when women in China are pushing back hard against widespread sexual abuse , in a manner similar to the #MeToo movement in Western countries.

Xuecheng is not the first prominent Chinese Buddhist monk facing serious allegations in recent years. In 2015, Abbot Shi Yongxin of Shaolin Temple, the country's legendary kung fu monastery, was accused of being an embezzler and womanizer with illegitimate children.

Past bundles of razor wire, reinforced fences, and guard posts, can be made out the cluster of gray, blue and salmon buildings which make up the Kaesong Industrial Complex.

Operated jointly by Seoul and Pyongyang from 2004 to 2016, Kaesong was a symbol of economic cooperation between the Koreas, and all the problems and difficulties that came with it: political uncertainty, worker exploitation, and investor skepticism.

A tourist uses binoculars to look at the Kaesong Industrial Complex from an observatory on the south side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ).

Following the successful intra-Korean summit and the coming meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump, people on both sides of the DMZ are looking again to renew business and trade ties that have been almost completely severed in the past decade.

The US has long floated the idea of economic assistance in return for disarmament. Should Tuesday's meeting result in a loosening of stringent US-led sanctions, North Korea would be poised to take advantage of greater economic links with the outside world, according to multiple analysts and people familiar with the situation in the country.

largest companies and a former Kaesong investor, said it was In May, Hyundai, one of South Korea'slargest companies and a former Kaesong investor, said it was setting up a task force in preparation for restarting economic projects in North Korea , while South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Kim Dong-yeon said Seoul has been "considering various scenarios" for greater economic cooperation.

Economic growth

Under the byungjin strategy adopted by Kim Jong Un since he came to power in 2011, North Korea has focused on building up the country's nuclear arsenal — now a key plank in negotiations with Washington and Seoul — and growing its economy.

"We have created a mighty sword for defending peace, as desired by all our people who had to tighten their belts for long years," he said, promising the military achievements would open up "bright prospects for the building of a prosperous country."

While Kim has not pursued the Chinese-style economic reforms some predicted he would, experts said there has been a quiet revolution inside North Korea, with a liberalizing of traditional controls over state businesses and a flourishing of private enterprises and markets, even as these have remained technically illegal.

There are also signs reformist politicians are wielding more influence under Kim. Pak Pong Ju , who was dismissed as North Korean premier in 2007 reportedly for pursuing market liberalization, was restored to that position five years ago, and now has responsibility for the economy.

An instructor from Choson Exchange addresses a classroom of North Korean students in Pyongsong, a city near the capital Pyongyang.

"It's no longer a taboo to talk about business or entrepreneurship and the need to grow and make money," said Nils Weisensee, head of operations for Choson Exchange

Choson has run startup bootcamps within North Korea for more than six years, training thousands of budding entrepreneurs in how to take an idea from concept stage to market, financial planning, consumer research, and other key skills.

"The people we train, the Koreans we have in our workshops are from really diverse backgrounds," Weisensee said. "Choson Exchange has quite a brand in (North Korea) now, there are many companies who are eager to send their staff so people learn how to be better managers, learn how to innovate more."

Choson Exchange has run hundreds of training classes in North Korea since 2012.

Millennial marketeers

Many of those who attend Choson's workshops are members of the "Jangmadang generation," those North Koreans born during the economic collapse and subsequent famine of the 1990s which changed the relationship between population and government and saw a flourishing of private markets, so-called jangmadang, or businesses and side hustles.

Joo Yang was born in 1991. Her early years coincided with the "Arduous March Famine," which lasted from 1994 to 1998 and took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

"A lot of people died of starvation and cold. Government officials at each level were siphoning off food for themselves, so citizens got less and less," she said in a documentary produced by the activist group Liberty in North Korea and named for the Jangmadang generation.

"We realized if we didn't do anything we would starve to death, so we started trading. If you had some rice you'd make and sell rice cakes, if you had corn you'd make and sell corn noodles."

For her first business, Joo gathered leftover soybeans from factory waste, cleaned and sold them. Other young North Koreans featured in the documentary, all of whom have since left the country, had similarly rough starts to their entrepreneurial careers.

As a young teenager, Min Kang stole "a few thousand won" with which he bought bags of apples to sell individually on trains which ran past his home.

"Little by little I made more money, I went to the border region to buy goods from China, things like batteries, flour and socks, and sold them to wholesalers in the interior," he said.

As more space opened up for people to launch businesses in North Korea, those who honed their skills during the rough years are well poised to take advantage, said Weisensee.

"The frontier entrepreneurs of North Korea are in some ways the ultimate entrepreneurs and start-up founders because they had to learn to operate under incredible uncertainty and lack of resources," he said.

Since Kim Jong Un launched the byungjin strategy, some 400 markets with 600,000 stalls have sprung up around the country in addition to dozens more, technically illegal jangmadang, according to Byung-yeon Kim , a professor at Seoul National University.

A defector who had traded at one of the markets told Korean media in 2016 every seller paid around 2,000 North Korean won (around $2) per day in unofficial "taxes" to local officials.

Reforming revenue

In a speech he gave last year in Berlin, South Korean President Moon Jae-in outlined a vision of gradual unification with the North driven by economic and cultural ties, following the example of East and West Germany.

"Economic cooperation where the South and the North prosper together is an important foundation of establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula," Moon said.

"We will freshly connect the South and the North, where it has been disconnected by the military demarcation line, with an economic belt and establish an economic community where the two Koreas proper together."

Key to this will be restoring transport links between the Koreas, and opening a pathway from manufacturers in the South through the North into China and the rest of the Eurasian continent.

"The severed inter-Korean railway will be connected again. A train departing from Busan and Mokpo will run through Pyongyang and Beijing, and head towards Russia and Europe. Cooperation projects in northeast Asia, such as the gas pipeline project connecting the two Koreas and Russia, may also be implemented," Moon said.

That plan has been communicated to North Korea: during their meeting at the DMZ, the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas, Moon gave Kim a USB stick containing details of three proposed "development belts" covering energy and natural resources; transportation, logistics and industry; and environment and tourism.

There is plenty of money to be made in North Korea. The country sits on an estimated $6 trillion worth of mineral reserves, including iron, gold, zinc, graphite and a host of rare earth materials needed in the production of smartphones and other high tech products. Existing mines are operating below capacity and many resources remain unexploited due to energy shortages and lack of access to new equipment, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies

For years, the primary purchaser of North Korean minerals has been its chief ally and neighbor, China, which in 2015 imported millions of dollars of coal and iron ore, as well as other minerals and precious metals.

That cross-border trade has been hurt by sanctions, but recently developments on the Korean Peninsula have seen a spike in housing prices in Dandong, a city on the Chinese side of the North Korean border, as speculators hope for a new economic boom following Kim's multiple visits to China and the upcoming Trump summit.

According to Chinese state-run Global Times , one real estate agency encouraging people to buy while property prices are still low referenced a "popular rumor that as North Korea reforms its economy Dandong might turn into another Shenzhen, the Chinese mainland boom city near Hong Kong."

South Korea is also eyeing North Korean mineral reserves. Last year, Seoul's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport invited bids on a plan to develop the North's mining industry, power generation and transport infrastructure.

Revenue from such projects could help "reduce the enormous cost" of a future unification , the ministry said, adding any such projects could "bring economic benefit to both South and North Korea."

South Korean speculators are also reportedly buying up property on their side of the DMZ, in the hopes prices will rise in future.

As well as its mineral resources, North Korea would also present a boom to manufacturers, especially those south of the DMZ, who would be able to take advantage of a Korean speaking workforce at far lower costs.

The majority of firms operating in Kaesong during its height were textile and clothing companies, with others producing electronics and chemical goods. The some 52,000 North Korean workers employed there were paid $180 a month . When the complex shut in 2016, South Korea's minimum wage was around $900 per month

Wol-san Liem, director of Korean Peninsula affairs at the Korean Public Service and Transport Workers' Union (KPTU), said there has not been enough discussion about what exactly economic cooperation would look like from the ground level, and how its benefits could be equally shared without leading to the exploitation and abuse of North Korean workers.

"There are huge risks," she said. "It's hard to think about it not happening. Kaesong was essentially South Korean capital exploiting cheap labor from North Korea, and North Koreans who come to South Korea now are working in the worst jobs for the lowest wages."

Initial opening up of North Korea will likely focus on special economic zones like Kaesong, similar to the model of reform followed by China in the 1990s.

"Inter-Korean economic cooperation will open up slowly," said Anwita Basu, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). "The groundwork was laid by the Kaesong industrial complex and the ski resort in Mount Kumgang. These projects cannot be re-opened unless UN sanctions are eased off and the US changes its maximum pressure strategy."

How willing foreign companies will be to engage in these zones is unclear, she added.

"The key among this is extreme uncertainty around contracts, regulations and high levels of corruption. Investors also find it difficult to transact money in and out of North Korea, because of sanctions. At the end of the day, the North Korean economy is far from opening up to the extent that foreign investors will be interested."

Moving beyond individual projects or applying their lessons to the rest of the economy presents a host of other problems.

China's reforms also saw mass unemployment and related problems, as people raised to rely on "iron rice bowl" jobs in state-run industries were cut loose to fend for themselves, even as the country as a whole enjoyed booming economic growth as it transitioned to state capitalism.

Basu, the EIU analyst, said economic liberalization in the North could also negatively affect the South.

"North Koreans will not be welcomed with open arms in South Korea," she said. "People there are already struggling with a lack of a social safety net and job security. An inflow of cheap labor would create more trouble in the job market."

South Korea is already dealing with economic and employment issues which could be exacerbated by greater intergration with North Korea.

Next steps

Any immediate economic growth within North Korea will likely depend on the country's domestic entrepreneurs.

Visions of greater international cooperation and outside investment are still very much theoretical, sanctions remain in place, and even if they were to be lifted, the threat they could be reimposed at any time -- as in the case of Iran -- will put off some businesses.

"(The) biggest target for Kim has been repairing the relationship with China, where sanctions have really strained the North's export earnings," said Stephan Haggard, an expert on the Koreas at the University of California San Diego. "He will be pushing for bilateral sanctions relief quietly and other forms of support there first."

Basu said Kim will also be reluctant to open up too quickly, even if the international community is willing to ease up on sanctions given the great uncertainty over denuclearization.

"The regime's security will be at risk if the opening up takes place too quickly and North Koreans flood out of the country for jobs," she said. "Worse still, if they get influenced by democratic cultures, they may demand such a system at home. The regime will have to adapt to the change in people's mindsets and somehow maintain its ethos and the system whilst also letting people leave."

Ken Eom, who defected to South Korea in 2010, said it may prove impossible for Pyongyang to control the pace of reform once it begins to lessen its grip on the populace and economy.

"The North Korean government does not have any experience in how to handle a capitalist economic system," he said.

North Korea, Eom told CNN in Seoul, where he works with other North Korean refugees, struggles to even control the "pre-market system" which has emerged in the country since the 1990s, let alone full capitalism. He added while Kim may hope to use reforms to strengthen government-run industries, bringing the tens of thousands of people who are operating outside the state system back into it may be impossible.

"People have already learned how to make money, how to deal with this new economic system by themselves," Eom said.

Or as another defector told the LiNK filmmakers: "Our parents generation was given everything by the government, but not our generation, we had to find our own food, and make our own money."
__label__world (CNN) Nobel Prize-winning novelist V.S. Naipaul, who was born in Trinidad but lived most of his life in England, died in his London home Saturday, Britain's Press Association reported, citing Naipaul's wife.

He was 85.

In awarding him the $1 million Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, the Swedish Academy praised Naipaul for combining genres into his own style that compels readers "to see the presence of suppressed histories. ... In a vigilant style, (he) transforms rage into precision and allows events to speak with their own inherent irony."

The Nobel judges singled out as his "masterpiece" the 1987 work "The Enigma of Arrival."

His first book was a novel, "The Mystic Masseur" in 1957. Other titles include "Miguel Street;" "A House for Mr. Biswas," with a protagonist based on Naipaul's father; "The Loss of El Dorado," a colonial history of Trinidad; and "Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions among the Converted Peoples," on the eastern regions of the Islamic world.

Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul was born in 1932, near Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, descended from Hindu immigrants from India. He went to England at 18 to study at Oxford University.

"He is to a very high degree a cosmopolitan writer, a fact that he himself considers to stem from his lack of roots: he is unhappy about the cultural and spiritual poverty of Trinidad, he feels alienated from India, and in England he is incapable of relating to and identifying with the traditional values of what was once a colonial power," the Nobel judges said.

Naipaul is recognized in India for his writings on Hindu civilization.

Sad to learn of the passing of V.S. Naipaul whose books are an penetrative exploration of faith, colonialism and the human condition, in his home in the Caribbean and beyond.

"Sad to learn of the passing of V.S. Naipaul whose books are an penetrative exploration of faith, colonialism and the human condition, in his home in the Caribbean and beyond. A loss for the world of letters and for the broader school of Indo-Anglian literature," tweeted Ram Nath Kovind, the President of India.

Naipaul also won the Booker Prize in 1971, among other literary honors. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1990.

"When I learnt to write I became my own master, I became very strong, and that strength is with me to this very day," he told Reuters in 2010.

Many of his novels are semi-autobiographical, with "A House for Mr. Biswas" clearly modeled on the author, his father and the house in which his family lived. The house was turned into the Naipaul House and Literary Museum in St. James, Port of Spain, in Trinidad.

__label__world (CNN) No man will see Huda Halasi's face or hear her voice while she goes through her four-month grieving period. She sits in a side room of her house in Aleppo province, surrounded only by her female relatives. Her eyes are fiery but her voice never rises above a whisper. For six years, she and her family agonized over her husband's fate. His whereabouts and conditions were shrouded in mystery.

Until one day in early August, the Syrian government issued his death certificate.

"We don't know when he died exactly," Huda says to her relative.

Abdul Ghafour Halasi, an anesthesiologist, was arrested in the early years of Syria's war. He vanished into an abyss of prisons and military intelligence centers, and was one of around 82,000 forcibly disappeared people that local and international rights groups demanded the Syrian government return.

Families scrambled to track down their imprisoned relatives and scraped together money to try to secure their release. Much of the time, their efforts were in vain. An old maxim resurfaced about the regime's arbitrary detentions: "Those inside the prisons have disappeared. Those who managed to get out, have a new lease on life."

Syrian artist and painter Najah al-Bukai sits in front of his drawings which he used to document torture and the dead at Syrian prisons.

Abdul Ghafour Halasi was last seen in Saydnaya prison just outside Damascus. Amnesty International dubbed Saydnaya "the human slaughterhouse " in a 2017 report after extensively documenting mass hangings at the detention center.

Until May, Syria's government refused to disclose the status of its unaccounted-for prisoners, and President Bashar al-Assad dismissed leaked photographs of thousands of dead inmates as "fake.

With Russian and Iranian backing, Assad remains in control. And, in an apparent attempt to turn the page on one of the darkest chapters in the country's seven-year war, human rights groups say that Syrian officials released the death notices of more than 800 prisoners over the course of this summer. However, the bodies of loved ones, have not been returned.

"The war is winding down and (the government) is trying to normalize relations with the different parts of Syria as quickly as it can," says Joshua Landis, Syria expert and Director of Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. "A big part of that is explaining what's happened to people."

Najah al-Bukai depicts prisoners transporting the dead to mass graves.

With the civil records of some of Syria's missing now marked "deceased," the government could be getting rid of some bureaucratic bottlenecks, and re-instituting government order and processes. The wives of deceased prisoners are now officially widows. Property disputes that hung in the balance because owners were missing can be resolved. The government hopes this will allow people to move on, as the war dwindles.

Documents obtained by rights groups tracking the death notices shed little light on the exact cause of death. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said the death certificates bore "no differences from a death certificate for ordinary citizens who died naturally." In civil records recently updated to reflect the deaths, causes are predominantly listed as "natural," "dehydration" or "cardiac arrests," according to rights groups, lawyers and activists that CNN spoke to.

But scores of testimony, photographs and government documents show the reality is a far cry from this, and that the scale of abuse at Syria's prisons may be too difficult to ignore. But rights groups say that survivors of Assad's prisons continue to stand as testament to the regime's abuses, even as Syria's war draws to a close.

News of the disappeared

Obaid Haj Ahmad believes that his brother, Saad, was 27 years old when he died in a Syrian detention center.

"I continued to follow his news for about six months and then he just disappeared," Obaid says. Saad, a non-violent activist, was shuttled between interrogation centers before being transferred to Saydnaya prison in 2012.

Two years later, a Syrian army defector codenamed Caesar released over 28,000 photographs showing the dead bodies of bruised and battered prisoners with a number on each of the corpses. Saad appeared among those photos.

"I exploded in tears immediately ... my brother took the phone from me, saw the photo and collapsed on the floor. I went to my mother and I told her that Saad became a martyr," Obaid recounts in an interview with CNN.

"I think he died right after we stopped receiving news of him. I'm glad he wasn't tortured for a longer time," he says.

Visual artist and former prisoner Najah al-Bukai was tasked with transporting dead inmates to mass graves. He says the first body he lugged over to the pit was marked with a white card: corpse number 5,535.

It was September 2014, four months after the pictures that came to be known as the Caesar photographs were released, and the dead were continuing to pile up.

He was a peaceful demonstrator, one of the intelligentsia that human rights lawyers have been able to show were targeted by the regime in the early years. He was released after his family paid a sum to secure his release.

"The last body I transported was numbered 5,874. There were also unnumbered corpses," he tells CNN.

Najah spent a total of a year and nine months as an inmate in Syrian prisons and interrogation centers. After his release, he moved to Lebanon where he began to sketch the torture from memory. He now exhibits his drawings around France, where he has resettled.

"I'm an artist. My visual memory doesn't get erased so fast. This whole time (in Lebanon), I was getting nightmares. Day and night, I'd cry to myself. So, drawing these pictures was a kind of psychotherapy, to draw what I experienced, what I saw," says Najah.

"And then it became a way to document the issue, because I knew I would eventually forget."

At the peak of his abuse, Najah was put on an electric chair where, he says, he was so gripped by horror that he defecated on the chair. The interrogators abruptly stopped the torture.

"For the interrogators, our lives are cheaper than flies. I remember one interrogator casually telling me about a dead prisoner. He said 'well, he was fated to die now.' It was so trivial to him," says Najah.

Death by soup

But Syria's prisoners were not only dying of torture, rights groups and activists say. Overcrowding, malnourishment and a severe shortage of medical treatment meant many succumbed to disease.

"Every two days, one person would die in front of me, because of the torture and the poor conditions and the lack of nourishment," says journalist Shiyar Khalil who shared a seven-square meter cell with 110 other prisoners in a notorious detention center known as the "Palestine Branch."

He adds that their daily ration consisted of a spoon of rice, a quarter of a potato, and soup with copious amounts of cooking oil.

"The soup gave us diarrhea to the point where we would become dehydrated. There were no medicines. Prisoners died because of the soup. This was one of the methods of death in the Palestine branch."

Shiyar says his hands were tied to a ceiling while interrogators flogged him and extinguished cigarettes on his back. Prison guards also used a torture technique on him known as "the flying carpet": a prisoner is strapped to a foldable board which, if bent far enough, can snap the person's spine.

"The deaths they're announcing now are of people who have been dead for a long time. We all knew this," says Shiyar.

"Because it's impossible for someone to stay alive in the circumstances of those prisons. With the conditions I was living under for those three months, I know that if I were there for six or seven months, I would have died."

Closure

Activists and lawyers argue that the regime's top brass was well aware of the crackdowns on non-violent participants in Syria's uprising, despite government denials.

Human rights lawyer Scott Gilmore who leads Syrian cases for DC-based Center for Justice and Accountability says he's pored over the evidence. Government documents from 2011, he says, showed that arrests ordered at "the highest levels" targeted journalists, demonstrators, and "anyone tarnishing the image of Syria in the foreign media."

"In the early years of the revolution, the regime was really engaged in liquidating the intelligentsia, liquidating civil society so you see this rounding up of lawyers, doctors, journalists, human rights activists," Gilmore tells CNN.

Meanwhile, the relatives of Syria's missing say they only hope for closure. Rights groups are now calling on the Syrian government to return the remains of the missing, so families can go through proper funeral rites.

The notorious "flying carpet" torture technique.

"For years, they have suffered the unbearable agony of not knowing what had become of their missing relatives. Now they have received the devastating confirmation that their loved ones are dead -- and are plunged into a new cycle of mourning," said Amnesty International Syria researcher Diana Semaan in a statement last month.

And analysts say that the government is keen to close the case for good. Syria realizes that "these things are not going to go away. That it's better to clear the air as quickly as possible, in a sense like ripping the bandage off fast," says Syria expert Joshua Landis.

No grave to visit

"When you lose someone, you have a corpse, you have a grave you can visit. But my aunt doesn't have a grave for her kid," says Kholoud Helmi, 32, whose family has just learned of her cousin Amir's death.

Unlike her cousin, Khouloud's younger brother Ahmad is still missing. Ahmad, a masters student in economics when he was detained, read voraciously and dreamed of a better Syria, says Khouloud. So when the uprising began in their Damascus suburb of Daraya, Khouloud and Ahmad took to the streets.

__label__world (CNN) Kenya has introduced a pioneering anti-poaching technique involving specially-trained sniffer dogs to crack down on illegal shipments of ivory and rhino horns out of the country.

The dogs will sniff airs samples collected from suspected shipments using the technique called Remote Air Sampling for Canine Olfaction (RASCO).

Samples are taken using filters and then presented to the dogs who can sniff out illegal items within seconds, a spokesman for Kenya Wildlife Service told CNN.

Paul Gathitu said the pilot scheme at the Mombasa port, a notorious route for illegal trafficking of ivory, has helped increase detection rates and made the process more efficient.

"Before now, we had to open shipments for the dogs to access the containers, but this new technique, we only take air samples from the vent in the shipment and present it to the canine unit, who within few seconds can spot those with illegal items," Gathitu told CNN.
__label__world (CNN) The Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen acknowledges "mistakes" were made in last month's deadly airstrike on a school bus in northern Yemen, the Saudi Press Agency said Saturday.

The attack killed 51 people, including 40 children , according to the Houthi-held Health Ministry. The coalition cited "mistakes in compliance to the rules of engagement."

The children had been on a field trip to a graveyard for rebels, one of the few green spaces left in Yemen's Saada governorate.

In a statement, the command issued "regret over the mistakes, extends its sympathies and solidarity to the families of the victims." It issued its conclusions after reviewing the findings of an assessment team.

"The Joint Forces Command will, as soon as the official findings are received, undertake legal proceedings to hold the ones who committed mistakes accountable according to the rules and regulations related to such cases," the coalition said.

(CNN) In a Salisbury restaurant -- not far from the where the nerve agent Novichok had been used by what Britain suspects were Russian operatives -- I had dinner where a man I at first took to be a bouncer turned out to be a magician.

Several times during our meal, he performed card tricks at our table. He was good: No matter how hard I looked, I could not catch his sleight of hand.

Something similar is happening in Syria right now.

Let me explain: Russia is preparing its biggest military exercises in close to four decades: 300,000 troops, 36,000 vehicles in its own far east.

Meanwhile, nine time zones to its west, Russia is shifting an unprecedented number of warships into the Mediterranean and Russian state media reported that the Russian navy and air force are set to hold large-scale exercises in the Mediterranean Sea in early September.

While the world is distracted by the destructive politics pitting Donald Trump against America's establishment and other global leaders , an ugly undercurrent of events is sucking Syria back into a vortex of what could become one of the ugliest episodes in the country's seven-year war.

An estimated half a million people have been killed, more than half the population has been internally displaced and millions have been thrust on neighboring nations as refugees.

Now, the final battle looms and a world weary of the continual carnage is looking the other way. But the tempo for the final phase of fighting is just picking up if you care to read the signs.

Phone calls between capitals and frosty diplomatic meetings have been coming apace this past week or so as well as a slew of Russian propaganda.

On Thursday, Russia's Defense Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, claimed that Syrian rebels in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib were preparing a chemical weapons attack they could blame on the Syrian government.

It's a sleight of hand they've tried before.

In March, Russian defense officials made a similar accusation. One month later, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces are suspected of using chemical weapons to kill dozens of Syrian civilians in a Damascus suburb.

British, American and French forces responded days later with a salvo of missiles on Assad's bases.

Whenever the Russians say to look at the rebels, it's worth keeping an eye on Assad.

But these are not the only hints that large-scale violence is about to return to Syria.

Idlib is the last of four of what the Russians have described as "safe zones." Each one has fallen to an onslaught by Iranian, Russian and Syrian forces. They have picked them off one by one when they were ready.

They weren't safe: They were simply stacked into a sequential series of offensives to be carried out whenever convenient for Assad.

An estimated 2.9 million civilians are in Idlib abutting the Turkish border. It was once home to 750,000. When the battle comes, the civilians will run -- many toward Turkey.

It has become the de facto last major rebel holdout. Following every rebel defeat in the past few years, Assad has given rebel fighters and families safe passage to Idlib.

He has long vowed to take the territory -- now home to an estimated 70,000 armed fighters, ranging from al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate to seasoned hardened rebel groups -- from Salafist to secular.

The rhetoric between Moscow and the West was ratcheted up further on Thursday, with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warning the West not to "play with fire" in Idlib, while the UN's Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said that the buildup to a Russian-backed Syrian regime offensive on Idlib amounts to the "perfect storm" that would lead to the "most horrific tragedy." This came a day after State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that US officials had met with Russian officials this week to warn against an escalation in Idlib.

In the past week, Moscow has hosted foreign ministers from Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- both backers, in one shape or another, of Syria's anti-Assad opposition.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has taken calls from both the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor, conversations that -- according to 10 Downing Street and the German Chancellery -- focused on Syria and in particular the impact new US sanctions may have on Turkey's ability to handle the latest waves of refugees.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis has also called his opposite number in Ankara to discuss Syria.

Behind the scenes, behind the distracting headlines each day, the drumbeat toward Assad's next bout of butchery is beginning to break through.

Bizarrely, in Moscow on Wednesday, Russia's foreign secretary accused the very rebels he and Assad have been busing to Idlib over the past two years of holding civilians there to ransom, accusing them of "trying to keep the civilian population hostage, use them as human shields."

That was the rationale he gave for what is clearly coming: "This hotbed (Idlib) must be eliminated."

Whether he said that to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he called him a week ago is unclear.

That day, Washington was abuzz with Trump's latest tribulations: His friend, National Enquirer publisher David Pecker , had been given immunity by federal prosecutors in the Michael Cohen case.

The same day, Pompeo announced a new US special representative for North Korea , and that he and the envoy would soon be traveling there. There was nothing but a cursory readout of his conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

It was also the same day Trump seemed to try to draw attention away from Russia, which in itself was odd, considering his national security adviser, John Bolton, was meeting that day in Geneva, Switzerland, with his Russian counterpart.

A possible jibe at journalists, Trump later that day said Russia gets too much attention at the expense of other national security concerns.

It's not clear whether he was intentionally distracting, or has himself been distracted.

But bottom line: An abundance of other stuff going on is clouding the view on a deadly storm in Syria about to be unleashed on its civilians.
__label__world Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) An operation is underway to evacuate thousands of tourists after a deadly earthquake that rocked some of Indonesia's most idyllic islands late Sunday night.

At least 98 people, all Indonesian nationals, were killed when the 6.9 magnitude quake struck the popular tourist island of Lombok, Indonesian authorities said Monday. More than 200 were also injured.

The majority of those killed in the quake were hit by falling debris from collapsing buildings, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the head of Indonesia's disaster management department.

In total, an estimated 20,000 people have been displaced by the massive earthquake, Nugroho said.

Dramatic video tweeted by authorities showed hundreds of people, many believed to be foreign vacationers, crammed onto a beach on the island of Gili Trawangan as evacuation measures got underway.

Emergency personnel were racing to evacuate thousands of tourists from the three small Gili Islands as night began to fall. The islands, famous for their white sandy beaches and clear waters, are located near the epicenter of the quake on Lombok.

Hundreds of people try to leave Gili Trawangan, north of neighboring Lombok island.

Earlier rescue efforts were hampered by shallow waters, but rising sea waters mean nine ships are now expected to dock on the islands.

So far, up to 2,700 tourists have been moved from the Gili Islands, according to Nugroho. He added that Lombok's airport was now open around the clock and had significantly increased its flight schedule.

The epicenter of the quake was in northern Lombok, a more residential, less developed part of the island. The majority of Lombok's tourist resorts are on the island's southern coast.

British tourist Mike Bennett, stranded on the island of Gili Meno along with around 100 other people, told CNN he faced an anxious night ahead.

"It's getting dark now," he said. "There's no power, there's no water, we're going to hold out and just see what happens tomorrow."

Childrens homes in ruins

Among the buildings destroyed in Lombok were two homes housing underprivileged children, with around 80 of the youngsters forced to sleep outside.

Martina Fetter, founder of the Peduli Anak Foundation , said that of the charity's four homes, two were now completely collapsed.

"The other two that we just finished building this year also have damages, cracked walls, roof partly falling, so it's still not safe to stay inside," she said.

"We still need tents, setting up emergency kitchen, food, water, generator to pump water," she added.

'The noise was deafening'

Retiree Deborah Storck was in a restaurant, about to eat dinner in Senggigi, on Lombok's west coast, when the quake hit.

"Everything started moving; the noise was deafening. We ran out into the street and a friend and I stood in the parking area hanging on to a parked car which was also swaying severely," she said.

"The friend I was with in the car park had a very lucky escape. A large wall fan fell off and landed in the chair she was sitting in before it ended up on the floor under the table."

Cracked concrete and damaged houses are pictured in Pemenang, northern Lombok.

Further north on the island, many were thought to be inside praying when the quake struck late Sunday, said Endri Susanto, who runs a nongovernmental organization assisting with relief efforts.

A tsunami warning was issued in the immediate aftermath of the quake, prompting people to flee to higher ground, said Susanto.

Susanto said the roads in the jungle leading to northern Lombok were treacherous and badly damaged in the quake, which is likely to hamper aid efforts.

Susanto said he had reached a hospital in the north of the island, which appeared "totally broken."

"I saw about 80% of the houses, 80% of the buildings had fallen down or collapsed because of the earthquake," he said of the area surrounding the hospital.

Aftershocks felt in Bali

The earthquake was also felt in neighboring Bali, another popular tourist spot. More than 100 aftershocks continued to rattle the region after the main quake.

"I can't imagine what has happened in the villages close to (the epicenter)," Evan Burns, the general manager of the Living Asia resort, told CNN by phone from Senggigi.

"It was quite bad," said Evans. "Many of our guests were panicking and it was our job to keep them calm."

Patients in their beds are moved to an emergency tent outside of the Tanjung hospital, Lombok.

Across the island, residents and tourists were advised to stay outside, with many choosing to sleep in the streets and public areas away from large buildings. Hospital patients were wheeled outside because of fear of aftershocks.

The devastation comes exactly a week after the region was hit by a 6.4 magnitude quake that left at least 15 people dead and 162 injured.

Dozens were injured, Durango state officials said, and it appears that a strong wind brought down Flight 2431.

"The control tower noticed strong wind currents, and this could have caused the accident," Durango Gov. Jose Aispuro said Tuesday night in a news conference.

The plane was en route Tuesday from Durango to Mexico City when it rapidly descended after takeoff, airline and state officials said.

Rescue crews flock to the remains of the airplane just beyond the runway.

The left wing of the twin-engine jet initially touched the ground, causing the plane to lose both engines. The plane then skidded off the runway at General Guadalupe Victoria International Airport, stopping about 300 meters (1,000 feet) away, Aispuro said.

__label__world Pyeongchang, South Korea (CNN) South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Saturday it was too early to talk about hosting a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, hinting he would not rush the matter.

A high-level delegation from the North invited Moon to Pyongyang for talks with his North Korean counterpart while in South Korea last week for the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

The delegation's unprecedented visit was hailed in some quarters as a diplomatic breakthrough , but Moon must now chart a way through tricky diplomatic waters.

"There are high expectations and our hearts seem to be getting impatient. It is like the old saying, seeking a scorched-rice water from a well," Moon told journalists in Pyeongchang after being asked whether he planned to hold a summit with North Korea.

The proverb translates to rushing into something without fully understanding the consequences.

At the time of the invitation, Moon responded by suggesting the two countries "should accomplish this by creating the right conditions," according to a presidential spokesman.

Addressing journalists Saturday at the Games' main press center, Moon hailed the progress that had already been made in advancing inter-Korean talks.

"I hope that this will lead to an improvement in inter-Korean relations -- not only inter-Korean relations, but we also believe that there has been slowly, but gradually, a growing consensus on the need for dialogue between the United States and North Korea," he said.

"We hope that the dialogue between the two Koreas will be able to lead to dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and eventually denuclearization."

South Korea's government is "waiting on ongoing dialogue between South and North Korea to lead to talks between the US and North Korea," he added.

Moon said that the participation of North Korea had helped to make it "a very safe Winter Olympic Games" after a period of mounting tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

People in the Koreas and around the world had been moved to see a unified South-North Korea team compete, he added.

If an encounter in Pyongyang took place, it would be the first between Kim and a South Korean leader. It would also be the first North-South summit on the peninsula since 2007 when South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun -- in whose administration Moon served -- met with Kim's father, Kim Jong Il.

While the meeting would be a diplomatic coup for Moon -- whose decision to pursue warmer relations with the North stands in stark contrast with his conservative predecessor -- it could strain relations with the United States, which appeared uncomfortable at the warm welcome afforded to the North Korean delegation.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday it will be "up to North Korea" to decide when it is ready to engage in serious and meaningful diplomatic talks with the United States.

Tillerson was reacting to Vice President Mike Pence's remarks to The Washington Post a day earlier that the Trump administration is willing to sit down and talk with North Korea.

Pence on Wednesday told US news outlet Axios that he actively chose to ignore Kim's sister at the Games' opening ceremony to send a "very clear message" to North Korea over its nuclear weapons threat.

"The fixed policy of the United States of America is that we are going to continue with all options on the table to bring intensifying economic and diplomatic pressure to bear until North Korea, once and for all, completely and verifiably abandons its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program," Pence is reported to have said.
__label__world (CNN) Hurricane Ophelia picked up pace as it marched toward Ireland, where it's forecast to bring strong winds and heavy rains this week.

Ophelia weakened from a Category 3 to a Category 2 hurricane early Sunday, with sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour (105 mph).

But the storm accelerated on its way to the British Isles and was moving quickly northeast at 56 kilometers per hour (35 mph).

"Preparations to protect lives and property should be rushed to completion by this afternoon," the National Hurricane Center warned in its Sunday 5 a.m ET (10 a.m. Dublin time) advisory.

The center said Ophelia gale force winds were expected in southern Ireland by early Monday, spreading gradually north across the country during the day. Hurricane-force winds are forecast to arrive by Monday afternoon, spreading inland into Monday night.

"Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30% stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater," the center said.

Ophelia is also forecast to produce 2 to 3 inches of rain with isolated totals nearing 4 inches through Tuesday across western Ireland and Scotland.

"A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves," the center warned.

The fast-moving storm has weakened slightly since Saturday, when it was packing 185 kilometer per hour (115 mph) sustained winds.

"Some additional weakening is expected today and on Monday, but Ophelia is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds as it approaches Ireland on Monday," the NHC said.

"The odd part about Ophelia is seeing this intensification take place in what's normally a much cooler region of the Atlantic Ocean," CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar said.

"Wind is going to be the biggest factor," Chinchar said of the forecast for Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland, where wind gusts could reach 130 kph (80 mph). The coasts of Portugal and Spain will see wind gusts of up to 90 kph (56 mph).

Chinchar said because the storm is racing along at more than 44 kph (28 mph), it won't have much of a chance to deluge Ireland.

Met Éireann, Ireland's National Meteorological Service, issued a red wind warning covering the counties of Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry and Mayo.

It said the storm could bring fierce winds "potentially causing structural damage and disruption, with dangerous marine conditions due to high seas and potential flooding."

"Tidal surges are expected in coastal areas with some flooding likely in coastal regions though the severe risk is expected from high winds and the possibility of fallen branches and trees," it said in a statement.

Irish transport provider Bus Eireann said it had canceled school bus services in areas covered by the red warnings Monday.

The Met Office in the UK said there were yellow wind warnings for Northern Ireland and parts of Great Britain for Monday and Tuesday.

But it said some areas would have high temperatures over the weekend "in part, due to the influence of (the storm), which will draw up very warm air from Spain on its eastern flank."

"Although parts of the UK may experience severe conditions, it's important to realize that not all areas will be affected by this ex-hurricane. For example, much of eastern England will be unusually warm for the time of year but quite breezy on Monday and Tuesday."

The Great Storm of 1987



Some British media pointed out that the storm was due to arrive 30 years to the day after Some British media pointed out that the storm was due to arrive 30 years to the day after the "Great Storm of 1987."

That storm made landfall in Cornwall, southwest England with winds of 120 mph (190 kph), making it the equivalent of a Category 3 Hurricane.

It was not technically a hurricane as it had formed in the Bay of Biscay rather than the tropics.

As it moves northeast, the remnants of Ophelia are expected to weaken and forecasters said it will dissipate by Wednesday.

Ophelia is the farthest east that a major hurricane has ever been in the Atlantic. The previous record was held by Frances in 1980, according to CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink.

CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam said warm ocean waters in the Atlantic had allowed Ophelia to form.

"Now that Ophelia is moving over colder waters in the northern latitudes of the Atlantic, it is losing its tropical characteristics," he said.

The storm is the sixth major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic basin hurricane season and the 10th consecutive named storm in the Atlantic to become a hurricane. The latter milestone ties a record that has occurred three times, most recently in 1893, more than a century ago.

The new urinals, housed in flower boxes, aren't subtle -- they're fully exposed on street corners, are painted bright red and have nearby signs advertising their presence.

City officials have installed four open-air urinals, or "uritrottoirs."

One in particular, located near the Notre-Dame cathedral, has drawn attention for its view of the River Seine.

The "intelligent urinals," which have a straw layer that eliminates odor, were installed in areas where public urination is a problem, according to a statement from city officials.

__label__world Story highlights The Rye Song Gang 1 has been banned by the UN from entering ports around the world

Japan "strongly suspects" it was involved in an illicit ship-to-ship transfer on Tuesday

Tokyo (CNN) A North Korean tanker has likely violated United Nations sanctions for the third time in recent months, according to authorities in Japan.

Images taken from a Japanese spy plane show the North Korean-flagged Rye Song Gang 1 anchored next to another vessel early Tuesday morning, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) east of Shanghai. The Rye Song Gang 1 is one of eight ships banned from entering ports across the globe under UN sanctions targeting North Korea.

Japan's Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs said in statements the government "strongly suspects" the two ships were involving in the transferring of goods while at sea.

A United Nations Security Council resolution passed in September bans UN member states from facilitating or engaging in ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean-flagged vessels.

The other ship allegedly involved, the Wan Heng 11, flies the flag of Belize, but is owned and managed by a Hong Kong-based company, according to records from Equasis, a shipping information database developed by European Union and French authorities. Ship owners and managers often register their vessels in other places to avoid domestic regulations.

__label__world (CNN) North Korea has threatened to abandon planned talks between leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in June if Washington insists on pushing it "into a corner" on nuclear disarmament.

A statement published by the state-run Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) said North Korea would never accept economic assistance from the US in exchange for unilaterally abandoning its nuclear program.

Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea's First Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was quoted in the article as saying the US said "it would offer economic compensation and benefit in case we abandon (nuclear weapons)."

"We have never had any expectation of US support in carrying out our economic construction and will not... make such a deal in future," he added.

If the Trump administration was "genuinely committed" to improving ties with Pyongyang, "they will receive a deserving response," Kim Kye Gwan said. "But if they try to push us into a corner and force only unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in that kind of talks and will have to reconsider ... the upcoming summit."

Pyongyang's rhetoric is similar to Trump's own: he said in April that even once parties are at the negotiating table, if talks aren't going the right way, "I will respectfully leave the meeting."

South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa spoke with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early Wednesday morning Seoul time, according to a statement, which quoted Pompeo as saying preparations would continue for the Trump-Kim summit, "keeping in mind this action of the North."

"Minister Kang and Secretary Pompeo agreed to continue close cooperation between South Korea and the United States to achieve a complete denuclearization and peace settlement on the Korean Peninsula," the South Korean statement said.

Yoon Young-chan, a senior spokesman for President Moon Jae-in, said the South Korean government sees the current impasse as a "growing pain in the process."

Adam Mount, a Korea expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said Pyongyang was seeking "to revise the terms of negotiations, not to end them altogether."

"The United States is faced with a critical choice: will it pursue a deal with North Korea that improves US and allied security but falls short of immediate denuclearization? Or will it walk away with nothing?" he added.

Not following the Libya model

The statement referenced comments made by Trump's national security adviser John Bolton about Libya being a potential model for North Korean denuclearization.

Pyongyang has referenced multiple times in the past its perceived need for a strong nuclear deterrent is based on US military aggression in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Bolton's comments, Kim said, were indicative of "an awfully sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq which had been collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers."

"It is absolutely absurd to dare compare (North Korea), a nuclear weapon state, to Libya which had been at the initial stage of nuclear development," he added. "(The) world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fate."

Singling out the national security adviser for personal criticism, Kim said that North Korea had "shed light on the quality of (John) Bolton already in the past, and we do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him."

Some analysts suggested that by focusing its statement so much on Bolton, rather than Trump, North Korea could be hoping to pressure the US President into sidelining his national security adviser.

Inter-Korean talks suspended

After weeks of improving ties on the Korean Peninsula, capped by the dramatic image of Kim shaking hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in , things took a sudden step backwards Wednesday.

In a missive delivered to the South in the early hours of the morning, the North said it was suspending high-level talks scheduled for Wednesday in view of "provocative military disturbances with South Korea."

North Korea's anger, which took both Seoul and Washington off guard, came as the two allies were conducting annual "Max Thunder" air force drills, which Pyongyang has always objected to in the past and accused of destabilizing the situation on the Peninsula.

In a statement, South Korea's Unification Ministry said it was regrettable that the North unilaterally postponed the talks due to the annual (South Korea-US) joint air combat drills."

An earlier KCNA report said the Max Thunder 2018 air combat drill was against the declaration -- signed last month between the Koreas -- wherein they agreed to cease all hostile acts against each other.

Back in March, when South Korea's national security adviser told reporters at the White House that Kim had invited Trump to meet, he also said that Kim "understands that the routine joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue."

'Not a cakewalk'

While Wednesday's statements were a noted departure from the conciliatory language North Korea had been using recently, analysts said Pyongyang is unlikely to abandon the Trump-Kim summit, when it has been trying to get a seat at the table with Washington for so long.

Experts said Pyongyang was likely annoyed by statements from both Washington and Seoul which painted North Korea as the weaker partner in negotiations, responding to US pressure rather than being treated as an equal nuclear power.

"Kim wants a summit, but I think the North Koreans are bent out of shape by Trump Administration officials claiming pressure brought them to the table," said Jeffrey Lewis, a non proliferation expert at the US-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies.

Christine Ahn, co-founder of Women Cross DMZ, which promotes peace building initiatives, pointed out North Korea has "made significant concessions" in the run up to the Trump-Kim summit.

"They suspended their ICBM and nuclear testing, they closed the nuclear testing site, and they just released three detained Americans," she said. "I wouldn't say that the Singapore meeting is off the table, but perhaps time for the US to change its tone."

CNN Beijing bureau chief Tim Schwarz, who has visited North Korea multiple times, said the "suggestion from the Trump administration that North Korea can be bought is also something that infuriates Pyongyang."

"North Korea would never admit that economic pressure has forced it to consider giving up its nukes. Its whole self identity is built on self-reliance," he added.

"North Korea has been extremely restrained in its public announcements since agreeing to the South Korea and the US summits. Now it appears to be annoyed that it is being seen as soft ahead of the main event in Singapore in June and this could be seen as reminding people that it is no walkover."

Other analysts agreed. Oliver Hotham, managing editor of Korea Risk, said there was "bound to be some push-back from the North Koreans eventually."

"The Trump admin has been acting like denuclearisation is a done deal, talking about economic incentives and shipping North Korean nuke hardware out of the country," he said. "Now the North Koreans are making it clear this is not going to be a cakewalk and they can play tough too."

__label__world Singapore (CNN) It was billed as the pre-summit summit. A gathering of regional defense chiefs in the very same city where the two leaders of the United States and North Korea are due to meet in a mere nine days' time.

But rather than offering a preview of next week's main event, issues surrounding North Korea took a backseat during this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's foremost security forum.

Instead, it was the rise of China that proved to be the most important and repeatedly talked about subject among delegates in Singapore.

When the impending meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did arise, conversations often centered less on the specifics of the meeting's likely agenda and more on where the leaders might choose to stay.

Would Trump or Kim be staying in the same hotels attendees were staying in -- would they be eating from the same buffet breakfasts?

Among the city state's several major hotels, the Capella is widely rumored to have become the frontrunner to house President Donald Trump during his stay next week.

The sprawling, luxurious resort is located on Sentosa island in Singapore's south. Isolated, scenic and with plenty of space, the hotel appears well situated to host a world leader or a historic summit.

Hotel staff dodged questions regarding the summit when asked on Sunday. But the hotel's lobby was filled with conspicuously muscular men speaking American-accented English. At one point a conversation could be overheard as to where an x-ray machine might be placed.

Ordinary Singaporeans CNN spoke with expressed curiosity about the arrival of the two leaders, but seemed more concerned about whether the meeting might lead to traffic delays rather than its wider political implications.

Crisis, what crisis?

That the planned Trump-Kim summit did not suck the oxygen out of the security forum, which wrapped up Sunday, may seem surprising considering the type of crowd it attracts.

That's not to say the subject of North Korea was not entirely absent from the summit's scheduled panel discussions. On Sunday, during a forum featuring defense ministers from South Korea, Japan and the US, the subject was a talking point , with Mattis himself suggesting the North will not be provided with sanctions relief until it has demonstrated "verifiable and irreversible" steps to denuclearization.

There was also a panel dedicated to the issue of denuclearization on Saturday.

However, for many of the government officials and experts at the forum, North Korea is something of a temporary headache, when compared to the much bigger issue of China and the disruption to what's known as the "rules-based order."

James Mattis, US Secretary of Defense, speaks during the Shangri-La Dialogue Asia Security Summit in Singapore, on Saturday, June 2, 2018.

The term, which is used as short hand for the principles and norms that have shaped and define the international system since the end of World War II, could be heard repeatedly throughout the summit.

In Asia, the most tangible example of the threat to the "rules-based order" is in the South China Sea, a body of water contested by a handful of regions that China claims as its own.

Beijing has fortified and militarized artificial islands in the region, a tactic that analysts and China's adversaries claim is meant to bolster its claims over the waters surrounding the islands and intimidate neighbors.

"China's militarization of artificial features in the South China Sea includes the deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers and, more recently, the landing of bomber aircraft at Woody island," Mattis said during his speech at the meeting Saturday

"Despite China's claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion," said Mattis.

On Sunday, the French armed forces minister, Florence Parly, appeared to capture the mood of the summit, when she declared that "just because the floodlights are on Panmunjom right now doesn't mean that the South China Sea issue will go away," referencing the peace village in the heart of the Demilitarized Zone, between North and South Korea.

During her address, Parly announced plans to sail a French maritime task group, together with British helicopters and ships, "into certain areas" of the South China Sea.

The objective she said was to ensure that freedom of navigation was upheld in the waters.

"At some point a stern voice intrudes into the transponder and tells us to sail away from supposedly 'territorial waters'," said Parly, who didn't reference China by name. "But our commander then calmly replies that he will sail forth, because these, under international law, are indeed international waters."

Bigger issues at play

The South China Sea has long been a flash point between the US and China. In fact, Mattis touched on the issue during his keynote address at the same conference last year, calling China's actions in the region examples of "contempt for other nations interests" and in "blatant disregard for international law."

Many of the defense leaders at this year's summit said that while North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs are threats to the world, especially now that it has successfully tested intercontinental-range missiles , how China will wield its growing power is a much more longer-term problem.

A total of $3.37 trillion in trade passed through the South China Sea in 2016, while approximately 40% of global liquefied natural gas trade transited through the waters in 2017, according to estimates provided by the Council of Foreign Relations

For many of the Southeast Asian and South Asian nations that attended the Singaporean forum, free and open access to the waterway is an economic necessity.

China therefore presents a more pressing issue to many of them -- it's a rising power that sits on many of their borders, threatening to upend the status quo.

Addressing the issue of the South China Sea on Saturday, Vietnam's minister of national defense, Gen. Ngo Xuan Lich, said that "under no circumstances, one could not make up excuses to militarilize by deploying weapons and military hardware on disputed areas or areas belong to another country."

Such an act suggested Ngo, "is a serious breach to the sovereignty of other countries (and) violates international laws."

Philippine Defense Minister Delfin Lorenzana echoed the general's comments Sunday, telling reporters that China's military build-up may be used "to intimidate others in the area."

In Tokyo, which is in range of North Korea's short and medium range ballistic missiles, China's rise remains a bigger geopolitical question mark than the threat from Pyongyang, said Jonathan Berkshire Miller, an analyst who specializes in Japanese foreign policy at the Japan Institute of International Affairs (JIIA).

"While tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain a real and important security challenge, these tensions also provide a convenient dividing wall masking head-on confrontation between China and the US alliance network," said Miller.

He said that once North Korea is removed from the situation, "strategic competition with China would come front and center."

(CNN) As long-simmering tensions in the Catholic Church again boil to the surface over allegations of child sex crimes, a prominent -- and controversial -- archbishop is calling for the Pope's resignation. Is the church confronting a coup, or is it finally facing a reckoning?

It's both.

Of course, the church needs to be held accountable for the scandal -- up to its highest leader. But there is little evidence that the new calls to oust Pope Francis are being made in good faith over genuine concern for children abused over decades -- or the culture of male impunity that enabled it.

No, this current wave of outrage is led by the conservative clergy, via a recent 11-page later from Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò -- the former top Vatican diplomat in the United States, who Francis chose to replace. Viganò alleges that a "homosexual current" led to the sexual abuse scandal and that Francis covered for a cardinal he knew was a "sexual predator." The Pope's response: "I will not say a single word on this."

It is important to note here that Viganò and other doctrinally conservative Catholics don't like the Pope's more progressive doctrine: things like caring for the poor, speaking out for immigrants, and easing up on the animosity toward gays and divorced women. In fact, those same conservatives have defended and even promoted the very aspects of the Catholic Church that allowed sex abuse and other appalling treatment of children to thrive: lionizing male power, subordinating women, and stigmatizing homosexuality.

Now they're using new sex abuse allegations as ammunition against a pope they believe is too permissive.

It's a drama in which there is no one to root for.

JUST WATCHED Hear abuse victims' messages for the Pope Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear abuse victims' messages for the Pope 05:14

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told NBC's "Today" show Tuesday that the Vatican knew about the sex abuse allegations in churches across his state, though he did not say when the Vatican learned of the allegations. Whether Pope Francis was personally aware is less clear, but as the leader and figurehead of the church, the responsibility ultimately lies with him -- as it did with his predecessor and the man before him, both of whom faced no consequences.

It is long past due that the head of this institution answers not just for the priests who spent decades abusing thousands of children, but for the institution itself spending millions to fight accusers and cover its own tracks.

But removing this Pope in exchange for someone who will please more traditional Catholics is hardly the answer. This abuse, and the system that covered it up and perpetuated it, did not exist in a vacuum. It is a direct outcome of the church's patriarchal structure and its fundamental bigotry.

After all, despite this Pope's designation as a "liberal," he still oversees an institution that discriminates against women so blatantly and unapologetically that, were it not a religious organization, it would run afoul of American anti-discrimination laws.

No institution, and no person, deserves the designation "progressive" if they treat women like second-class citizens, refusing to allow us to occupy the same positions as men, and putting us in a kind of separate and unequal category of human being.

Indeed, this impacted my own family : When my grandmother, a survivor of domestic abuse, finally left her marriage and found herself a single mother of five young children in the 1950s, the church turned its back on her. My grandfather, on the other hand, remained enough in its good graces that, years later, he was able to get his marriage conveniently annulled so he could remarry with the church's blessing.

The church's misogyny has led to some of its worst abuses. Sex abuse of altar boys rightly made headlines, but girls were sexually assaulted and raped, too. And boys were abused in large part because of the fact that ingrained Church sexism gave priests easier access to boys than girls -- until relatively recently, girls couldn't be altar servers . The all-male church power structure meant that priests got more alone time with young boys, and the church's own misogyny and homophobia compounded the shame and silence that so many abused boys carried into adulthood.

Catholic patriarchy didn't just beget priests who sexually assaulted children. Around the world, the church branded unmarried women immoral, treating them like social contaminants and hiding them away in shame. Some of the children of unmarried women wound up in orphanages, and suffered greatly -- beaten, starved, mutilated. Some of them died, allegedly at the hands of neglectful or abusive nuns.

And still today, the church opposes the rights of women to decide when and whether to have children -- even contraception is forbidden. Women's bodies aren't theirs; they are vessels for male prerogatives. Is it any surprise that an institution in which this view of women is deeply ingrained is also an institution in which sexual assault -- a crime in which one person believes they have total authority over another's body -- flourishes with little consequence?

No institution can totally immunize itself from abuse, but it can either foster or discourage the conditions for it. The church fostered them. And so, yes, the Pope should pay a price -- probably with his job. But so should every other male authority figure in the church who has worked to uphold unfettered patriarchal power and to keep women in positions of subservience.

Which means, of course, that the entire church must radically reform -- and if it doesn't, decent Catholics must decide that keeping with their faith demands abandoning this noxious institution.

Trump tells reporters that “there's a very substantial chance that it won't work out … that doesn't mean that it won't work out over a period of time, but it may not work out for June 12.” Secretary of State Pompeo tells reporters later in the day that he remains optimistic.

(CNN) By attacking our closest allies and their leaders and displaying obsequious deference to the virtual dictator Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump has repudiated American global leadership. He has replaced it with a hyper-nationalism and unilateralism that are less of a foreign policy and more the bullying tactics of a would-be strongman.

Susan Dunn

Trump's "America First" isolationism is fast weakening and isolating the United States, undermining the stability of long-standing alliances, and allowing dictatorships to thrive unchallenged around the world.

At the same time, it represents a dangerous and head-spinning reversal from decades of American conduct. Today, more than ever, we need Republican leaders who share the far-sighted and generous internationalist vision of the post-war future held in the 1940s by three exceptional Republicans: Henry Luce, the publisher of Time, Life, and Fortune; Wendell Willkie, the successful Indiana businessman who ran against and lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 election; and Henry Stimson, FDR's secretary of war.

Luce published his famous article, "The American Century," in February 1941, seven months after all the European democracies -- except Great Britain -- had surrendered to Hitler's ruthless armies. Luce traced this catastrophe to the end of World War I when the Senate rejected Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations and the United States began its retreat from world affairs.

In the 1920s and '30s, Americans embraced "the moral and practical bankruptcy" of isolationism, Luce wrote, and "failed to play their part as a world power." That unwillingness to confront Hitler's aggression in the 1930s, he underscored, brought "disastrous consequences" to "all mankind."

Other Facts:

The Anglican Church originated when King Henry VIII split from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534, when the pope refused to grant the king an annulment.

__label__world Rajasthan, India (CNN) It was meant to be a quick run to the local village shop. Instead, it marked the beginning of a terrifying ordeal.

It was a spring afternoon when 15-year-old Maya walked into the shop in her village in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan to buy some onions for her mother.

The shop, a small single-story brick building, is among the few solid structures in the village and a clear marker of wealth and prestige.

Maya's home, in contrast, is a small hut open to the elements on three sides. Maya and her five siblings survive on whatever her mother, who was widowed nine years ago, earns as a casual laborer. Usually that's as little as $2 a day.

Maya's alleged attacker was arrested soon after the attack but is still awaiting trial.

Maya had been to the shop countless times before. She'd known the shopkeeper and his family for years. Which is why, she says, she didn't think twice when he told her to go inside and fetch the onions herself.

It was then, as she walked in, that he closed and locked the door behind her.

Maya screamed -- but the shopkeeper, who was twice her age, covered her mouth with his hand and threatened to kill her unless she kept quiet.

He then forcibly undressed her, and raped her.

Maya later told police in a complaint filed in May 2016 that her rapist locked her in the shop until she was rescued by her mother, four hours later.

"It's still hard to think about what happened," said Maya's mother, who went looking for her daughter after she didn't return from the shop.

JUST WATCHED The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back 02:03

More than two years on, Maya is still waiting for justice.

CNN is not using her real name, in accordance with Indian law that prevents the naming of victims of sexual violence. And there are many.

Almost 39,000 women and children were reported to have been raped in 2016, according to the most recent figures from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). That's more than 100 a day, or one every 15 minutes.

'Still see humiliation'

A recent spate of high profile cases involving women and girls has underscored India's problem with sexual violence.

In recent months, thousands of Indians have come onto the streets in marches and protests to demand action.

Experts in the area acknowledge that progress has been made: there is better reporting of crimes against women. The outrage after the 2012 rape and murder of a young medical student in the capital Delhi spurred numerous legal changes, including a broadening of what constitutes rape.

In April this year, authorities passed an executive order introducing the death penalty for the rape of a girl under 12. This latest change, however, has prompted criticism from experts who say that the threat of capital punishment for their attackers could dissuade victims from reporting.

Anganwadi workers shout slogans during a protest calling for justice following the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Yet too many victims seeking justice face an uphill battle. Figures from India's official National Crime Records Bureau show that while the number of reported rape cases of women climbed by 56% from 2012 to 2016, the conviction rate stood at 25.5% percent in 2016 -- just marginally above the 24.2% rate reported for 2012.

Convictions in sexual violence cases are lower than for other crimes such as theft or murder. And many cases are caught in a backlog in Indian courts. As of 2016, the number of outstanding cases rose to 133,376 from just over 101,000 in 2012.

Too often, new laws "are not being implemented, and the training that is being given through the justice system is not being implemented," said Jayshree Bajoria, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Delhi, who authored a Human Rights Watch report looking at the barriers rape survivors face in accessing justice.

The reality is that, despite new legislation, "much of it (justice) doesn't actually reach the victims. They still see bias. They still see humiliation," Bajoria said.

Maya's fight for justice has been taken up by her uncle, who stepped in to take the burden of the legal challenge.

"Every step is a fight," her uncle said. "It is very hard."

Uphill battle

Just how hard they've fought for justice is apparent from the winding trajectory of Maya's case.

The shopkeeper was arrested on May 22, 2016, the same day the first police complaint was filed and one day after the alleged incident.

A medical exam concluded Maya had been raped. Formal charges were filed in mid-August. Because of Maya's age, the shopkeeper was booked under laws governing sexual violence against minors, and the case was sent to a special court for minor victims. The same law blocked the shopkeeper from getting bail.

"She was a minor, so there was no question of bail," said Harish Chand Dipankar from the local NGO Jan Sahas, which means "courage for people." The group stepped in to provide free legal support to Maya and her family, with local lawyer Tarachand Pohiya, to help them navigate India's legal system.

The staff of the local NGO, Jan Sahas operating in Bharatpur, Rajasthan sitting outside the local court and parsing through case files with Tarachand Pohiya, a lawyer who works with them.

Dipankar has worked with Jan Sahas for the past nine years. The NGO, which operates out of a small apartment in the city of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, is staffed by volunteers, many of whom travel from nearby villages every day to work for a few hours in the office.

In a country where illiteracy is widespread and many people are unaware of their legal rights, the volunteers help victims file an official complaint.

"They are poor people. The mother and the uncle cannot read or write. They don't have any official documents to show when she was born. There's no birth certificate recording exactly when she was born," said Pohiya. According to legal documents, however, there was a certificate from Maya's school confirming that she was only 15 at the time of the alleged attack.

"Somehow he still got bail. He convinced the court that she wasn't underage," said Pohiya, who runs his own practice in the local courts but takes out a few hours regularly to help out wherever he can.

The shopkeeper convinced a judge, in an appeal filed in the local court nine months after the alleged attack, that the victim wasn't a minor and was in fact 20 years old.

He told police that Maya had had multiple "relationships," and used this claim in an effort to prove that she consented to have sex with him. "They tried to humiliate her," added Pohiya.

The local court sided with the shopkeeper and he was granted bail, a decision that prosecutors then challenged in the State High Court, which led to more court hearings but no progress in the rape proceedings.

The shopkeeper's bail was finally canceled in July 2017 and police were directed to re-arrest him. Nine months later he surrendered and is now in custody.

The case is now finally back on track.

"All this time, and we are still waiting for something to move forward in the case," said Maya's uncle.

"It's taken all this time to get it back to where it was in 2016. They (the shopkeeper's family) has also come to us to settle the case in return for money. They keep saying we should just resolve this between ourselves."

"We see this all the time," said Dipankar, from the NGO Jan Sahas. "That's what happens in many cases, especially when the victim is from a poorer or lower caste family. If the accused is wealthier or has more influence in the village, the victim will often face a lot of pressure to just settle."

But Maya's family refuses to give up. Her mother explained why.

"Why should we settle? We didn't do anything wrong. Is there something wrong in demanding justice for my daughter?"

__label__world (CNN) The Spanish government said Thursday it would begin the process to impose direct rule on Catalonia in an unprecedented move to crush the region's independence bid.

In a statement from Madrid, the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said it would invoke Article 155 of the constitution, a provision that allows the central government to suspend the autonomy of the Catalan regional administration.

Rajoy's Cabinet will meet on Saturday to agree measures to "restore the constitutional order" in Catalonia, where a banned referendum on independence took place earlier this month. The plan will then be put before the Senate, where Rajoy's Popular Party has a majority, for approval.

The statement did not spell out what steps would be taken under Article 155, but the provision gives Madrid the power to take over the running of Catalan institutions and force new elections. It has never been invoked before.

Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont delivers a speech in Barcelona on October 15.

The announcement came minutes after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont threatened that the region could formally declare independence if the Spanish government did not engage in dialogue.

__label__world Story highlights Chinese state-media has been offering a full-throated defense of recent constitutional changes

Dropping term limits, critics say, clears the way for President Xi Jinping to serve indefinitely

Hong Kong (CNN) China's top newspaper has defended a move to drop presidential term limits, refuting allegations that it clears the way for Xi Jinping to rule the country indefinitely.

In a commentary Thursday, the state-run People's Daily defended the constitutional change as an "important move."

"This amendment does not mean changing the retirement system for party and national leaders, and does not mean a life-long term system for leading officials," it said.

The editorial comes after criticism both outside and inside China of the move, which comes after years of speculation Xi would seek to buck tradition and remain in power after his two five-year presidential terms were up.

"Removing term limits does not mean that Xi will necessarily stay in for a third term, but it is hard to see who would have the audacity to challenge Xi should he decide to stay on for a third term," Margaret Lewis, a professor of law and Chinese constitutional expert at Seton Hall University.

(CNN) Europe's political establishment will have all eyes Monday on the meeting in Washington DC between Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and US President Donald Trump.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron -- no big fans of the US administration -- are bound to hold their breath in fear that Italy might lend Trump a hand in further destabilizing the European Union, already torn by contrasts between member states and facing a deadlock in its integration process.

And they do have cause for concern. Conte is turning out to be Trump's main supporter and ally in Europe.

Trump will exploit his bilateral session with Conte to reaffirm the special bond with Italy in the eyes of Merkel and Macron, who have so far had a bumpy relationship with Trump. Likewise, Conte will be keen to show off to his EU partners the VIP welcome he will get at the White House, and cash in on it.

Though it is highly unlikely that Conte will openly call for lifting sanctions on Russia, he will show himself more supportive to ending them after the European Council approved a six-month extension in June.

__label__world San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- The United States has quietly funded and equipped elite paramilitary police officers in El Salvador who are accused of illegally executing gang members, CNN has learned.

Successive US administrations have pumped tens of millions of dollars into Salvadoran law enforcement and military to shore up the government’s “Mano Dura” or Firm Hand program, first launched in 2003 but redoubled in 2014 to tackle the country’s rampant gang problem.

Yet the country’s police will be broadly accused next month of “a pattern of behavior by security personnel amounting to extrajudicial executions” in a United Nations report, seen in advance by CNN, that will also call on Salvadoran security forces to break a “cycle of impunity” in which killings are rarely punished.

One police unit that killed 43 alleged gang members in the first six months of last year received significant US funding, CNN can reveal. Several of those deaths have been investigated as murders by Salvadoran police.

While the unit -- known as the Special Reaction Forces (FES) -- was disbanded earlier this year, many of its officers have joined a new elite force that currently receives US funding.

The exact recipients and nature of US funding for Salvadoran police are shrouded in secrecy. Publicly available documents rarely specify which units benefit from the $67.9 million in total aid given in 2016, and the $72.7 million last year, but they do say that “vetted units” get mentors from the FBI and DEA.

But two sources with knowledge of the US train-and-equip program, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, told CNN that the FES was the recipient of US assistance. One source detailed the kind of equipment provided, which is shown on a US report to Congress, without naming its specific recipient.

The American assistance to the FES and its successor exposes the stark moral compromises undertaken in the fight against groups like MS-13, a Salvadoran criminal gang that started in Los Angeles in the 1980s but has since spread across the Americas and has around tens of thousands of core members in El Salvador. MS-13 recruits have been described by the US government as a “transnational threat” and as “animals” by US President Donald Trump.

As FES officers were shooting gangsters dead in the streets, the US government was sending money and equipment to the group while also deporting thousands of MS-13 recruits back to El Salvador, further fueling the growth of the group in a country where police may be getting away with murder, according to the forthcoming UN report.

A member of the Special Reaction Forces (FES) stands guard in Soyapango, El Salvador in April 2016.

When confronted with the evidence obtained by CNN, a spokesperson for the US Embassy in El Salvador admitted for the first time that the US had supplied assistance to the FES unit, but said that “the US government takes allegations of extrajudicial killings extremely seriously, and has consistently expressed concerns regarding allegations of security force abuses, the need for accountability, and the critical role of rights-respecting security forces in a healthy democracy.”

The spokesperson added that all Salvadoran police units receiving US assistance were heavily vetted, and must show a “fundamental commitment to effective police mechanisms and respect for human rights” or the assistance stops. The US Embassy would not say if the FES received lethal aid.

The culture of lawlessness in El Salvador has also been exposed in a series of WhatsApp conversations in which officers discuss tactics for hiding extrajudicial executions and which gang members to target.

The messages, obtained by CNN, were sent in May 2017 and first leaked to local news outlet Factum by a police informant turned whistleblower who was included in the group chats. The Salvadoran police did not dispute the authenticity of the messages when asked about them by CNN.

In one exchange, an officer from an unknown police unit despairs at colleagues who beat a gang member before killing him and planting weapons at the scene to make the incident look like a shootout. The marks on the man’s body undermine the officers’ cover-up story, he says.

The following conversation has been translated and lightly edited from a series of Spanish text and voice messages exchanged between police officers.

Police officer 2 Very abused

Police officer 2 Tomorrow they pay

Police officer 1 Beautiful weapon 😍

Police officer 2 AUDIO FROM POLICE OFFICER 3: Do you remember what we’re talking about that d****head in summit 4. It’s rumored that the mother****** got caught…and was beaten with a stick, he got beaten big time before he was killed. Later I saw in the news that the Prosecutor's Office had confiscated two weapons from him but they were going to check ballistic evidence because it was very curious how that piece of s*** had died.

Police officer 2 This d*** lives near where they killed the gang member who killed the girls in Nejapa and kidnapped the boy/girl. Listen to the audio, there are witnesses who saw that they were hitting that son of a b**** before killing him. But the comrades portrayed it as a shootout. Here you have bad procedures put into practice.

Police officer 1 Why the f***, if one is going to do some s*** like that, you better be sure there are no witnesses. But in here it says, well, listen to the audio. He’s a crazy d***! He’s a piece of s***, a technician that works for me and he goes and tells me this!

Police officer 4 I want a large charger, can you get me one



Police officer 1 What brand and model is that girl 🤔🤔🤔

Police officer 2 Beretta

Police officer 4 It's a 19mm Canik 55

From one unit to another

The FES was dissolved in a shakeup of elite police forces after another unit held a drunken New Year’s party in December 2017 in which one of its female officers disappeared. She is still missing.

Yet even after FES members were accused of illegal killings and broken up, dozens of the group’s officers were transferred into a newly-created unit called the Jaguars. The US Embassy and Salvadoran police said applicants to the Jaguar unit were vetted.

The Jaguars also benefit from substantial US funding and support, according to their leader, Commander Cesar Ortega, who told CNN his men target gang leaders in a bid to break up their hierarchy.

“The US participates in training as well as providing equipment,” Ortega said. “The only thing that the US government does not supply is lethal equipment, the weapons and the ammunition.” Their guns are bought using Salvadoran government money, from a US manufacturer.

On a recent spring afternoon, it was clear that the Jaguars stood out from their poorly-equipped civil police colleagues.

Wearing masks and shrouded in bulletproof American-supplied Kevlar panels, Commander Ortega’s men stormed the tight alleyways splintering off San Salvador’s back streets, easily overwhelming the rickety slum they were searching.

In the back of their US-funded SUV lay a 15-year-old boy in handcuffs, his other five friends having fled along the nearby riverbank.

After about an hour of moving from house to house, the Jaguars returned to their vehicles. It was likely the five had escaped for the time being. The unit moved on to patrol the heights of the slums above San Salvador -- their heavy firepower perhaps assuring some, but troubling others.

The UN’s special rapporteur for extrajudicial executions, Agnes Callamard, will highlight in her forthcoming report that 92% of investigations against Salvadoran police are dismissed in the first 72 hours, and very few result in conviction.

The report will say also that El Salvador’s attorney general announced in August last year that “his office had opened investigations into three death squads operating in the country: two in the eastern zone and one in the western zone, and in which police officers were involved.” It was unclear which groups the report was referring to.

In fact, there is only thought to have been one case of an officer being sentenced for an extrajudicial killing, on May 9 of this year. Critics say the units accused are simply dissolved, re-branded, and its officers redeployed to a new unit. Most of the Jaguar officers CNN spoke to admitted they were previously in the FES.

Hunted down

The FES were accused of the murder of two gang members, including one called Samuel Antonio Avelar Carpio -- whose gang name was “Eclipse” -- in a house in the District Italiano area near San Salvador in March 2017.

Witnesses described how FES officers stealthily moved through the neighborhood’s narrow streets before encircling one house where they located their target, Eclipse, in one of its bedrooms.

After Eclipse and his friends agreed to surrender to police, there was a long pause, followed by the four shots that killed them, one neighbor claimed.

The police screamed “Hand in your weapons!” and the men replied “there they are, mister,” the neighbor recalled. “And all of a sudden, we heard the first shot. Then there was some silence and, after, another four shots were fired.”

Eclipse’s mother, who sought anonymity like most locals in gang areas when discussing police activities, tearfully described how she believed her son had been killed.

“Here he was, lying down, his hands like this [behind his head], as he had been sleeping,” she said, motioning towards the bed where she claims he was shot in the back. “They killed my son.”

Salvadoran police investigated the killings, and no charges were filed. The police said in a statement that they were fighting “terrorists” who use murder as a currency, cited “awareness-raising and training processes on different issues regarding the respect of human rights and the use of force,” and said they were “purging from its ranks those who break legal norms.”

The police said 273 officers were accused of illegal armed aggression in 90 court cases last year, and said hundreds of officers were disciplined annually for various reasons.

"There’s a general belief about this unit having green light to kill these gang members, but that’s a lie,” the Jaguar commander Cesar Ortega told CNN. “We stick to the legal norms of our country. We can only respond against an aggression, we use the force level that apply to all police corps. And, as a last resort, we fire our weapons."

Beat officers from the National Civil Police on a routine patrol one night in April.

According to the upcoming UN report, 103 alleged gang members were killed in confrontations with police in 2014, yet the number rose to 591 in 2016.

In a rare interview, a senior MS-13 member said the recent spate of killings had caused the gang to think about “mediation” with the government.

Speaking anonymously, saying he feared police targeting, the spokesman told CNN: “We don’t have instructions to kill them, as they have with us. They picture the whole situation as an armed confrontation, but they place the weapons on the dead bodies themselves. What happened with Eclipse is not the only one.”

Despite MS-13 being accused of rape and murder, he went on to call for peace. “We’re ready to surrender the use of weapons at national level, but the government is not paying attention.”

“They are not tackling violence, they’re exterminating us, and the extra income is only used to pay police for killing us. So, we’re opening the door to mediators to help us.”

Such a plea for negotiation or a truce is not a new tactic, and critics will dispute whether the gang can sue for peace while roughly one tenth of Salvadoran society remains under their sway and at risk of their violence.

Previous deals have collapsed in the past, and analysts point out the renewed police crackdown is usually met with gangs escalating their violence in response.

Locals have grown accustomed to routine police searches in the bars and discos of San Salvador.

El Salvador has recently changed its laws to soften the penalties for police conduct during its ongoing crackdown on gangs. Today, officers who are not charged within 72 hours of a killing can return to active duty -- a tweak in the law that critics say has resulted in the belief here that police can kill without consequence.

The killing is far from random, according to the WhatsApp messages between officers obtained by CNN.

In one conversation from May 2017, an FES officer urgently asks the informant for the photograph of a gang member named “Shadow” who he wants to “crash,” which in police jargon means “execute.”

The following conversation has been translated and lightly edited from a series of Spanish text and voice messages exchanged between police officers and an informant.

FES OFFICER Good morning, command, I was wondering if you could give us a hand because we need to go and verify some witnesses in Aguilares, could you accompany us, command? Can we pick you up somewhere? OK, command?

INFORMANT Sorry, I'm really busy with paperwork for my family.

FES OFFICER It's OK







FES OFFICER Look who we’ve grabbed here in Aguilares.

If we need to, command.

We need the money, command

INFORMANT Send me the account, command, it’s difficult for me to get out, that money is yours without a doubt

FES OFFICER Could you do me a favor, command? Could you send us a pic of Shadow? We’re going now, we have located him and since you have a patrol dedicated to Shadow, send me his photo right now, we're going to crash that bastard. Send me urgently a picture of Shadow, Sebas, the bastard, and the rest of the group, but mainly Shadow’s. It would be good to meet at night and we can bring him, command.



INFORMANT Brother of Shadow ... I’ll send the one of Shadow.

A risky investment

The ongoing multi-million dollar program of support for the Salvadoran police and military police presents a moral quandary for US policymakers. Providing assistance risks aiding and equipping units that may have been involved in haphazard and illegal executions, yet withdrawing aid altogether risks abandoning the Salvadoran police to a less effective future, one where they have no US support or oversight at all.

The Trump and Obama administrations have both recognized the acute nature of the MS-13 threat.

Until 2016, the program was overseen militarily by John Kelly, the former head of the Pentagon’s SOUTHCOM who is now Trump’s chief of staff.

While the US program is aimed at improving the effectiveness and legality of El Salvador’s fight against gangs, narcotraffickers and human smugglers, the “Firm Hand” strategy being deployed now by country’s government -- against a gang culture so widespread it amounts to an insurgency of sorts -- runs counter to lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to some analysts. In those US-led conflicts, corrupt security forces and brutality exacerbated the ferocity of the insurgency.

Analysts have noted that brutal police tactics have previously backfired, as the gang members killed are sometimes looked upon more favorably in their neighborhoods, or less guilty than intelligence suggests, causing anger in the community and prompting some residents to turn away from the police and towards the gangs.

The US State Department mentioned the killing of Eclipse, the gang member, by FES officers in its 2018 report. “On August 25, the officers were released because the 72-hour holding period had expired,” the report noted. “They were put on Administrative leave but returned to active duty on September 12.”

In fact, it is possible one of those officers now works in the new Jaguar unit, according to expert analysis of his photograph and the footage of the new Jaguar unit filmed by CNN.

Asked to examine the images by CNN, Kenny Long, a former UK Metropolitan Police forensic identity expert, made a positive identification of the officer. Absolute certainty in identifications like this is rare, but Long said that the quality of the images were such that it would likely result in an arrest in a UK police investigation.

“It is rare to get images these clear -- the amount of features that are the same are very, very rare”, said Long. “If I made an ID like this [with the UK police], this person would be arrested.”

CNN is not naming the officer in question or showing his picture, as access to the Jaguar police unit was provided on the basis their officers would remain anonymous. Salvadoran police declined to comment on the officer in question, but did say the Jaguars go through an “internal selection process” so that “only qualified personnel can join the unit”.

Visitors to a disco in San Salvador wait for police to finish their search in April.

Since the death of Eclipse, the people CNN spoke to in District Italiano say they have gone back to being ignored by the state again -- a place where poverty and unemployment are part of the daily grind of navigating gang culture and rule.

Leaning on a chain fence, one local woman said she hadn’t seen the police in the area since.

“Ever since that happened they don’t show their faces around here,” she said. “Maybe they don’t come back anymore because they have already done what they had to do.”

Following the publication of CNN’s investigation, the Director General of the National Police Howard Cotto said Thursday there were some inaccuracies in recent international media reports but did not provide further details. Cotto emphasized that the police have the right under the constitution to use force to defend themselves and that if there are members within the 28,000-strong police force who carry out irregular acts they must be investigated. CNN gave the authorities a week to provide a response ahead of publication, which was included in the report.
__label__world (CNN) Australia is set to have a new prime minister, again, with the Liberal Party's Scott Morrison on track to become the country's 30th premier following his victory in a leadership vote on Friday.

Morrison, a notoriously ambitious political chameleon, is deemed by some analysts to be a centrist able to unite the troubled ruling Liberal Party after the ouster of former leader Malcolm Turnbull.

Australian commentators have long wrangled over who the real Scott Morrison is, but the question has become more acute now that he's about to assume the top job.

He is expected to be sworn in as prime minister by the country's governor general at some point in the coming hours and days.

Over the years, Morrison has undergone a transformation from a right-wing evangelical immigration minister to a wonky, staid treasury minister attempting to show his more human side.

President Rodrigo Duterte: Catholic Church "full of shit"

Manila, Philippines (CNN) "A life of sufferings, a life of killings. Is this the will of God?"

Father Amado Picardal does not flinch from the enormity of the question. As a priest in Metro Manila, he's confronted nightly with the bloodshed of President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war, which police say has now claimed more than 7,000 lives.

Picardal refuses to place that toll at God's doorstep.

He says there is a "blood lust" in the country, encouraged by propaganda, deceit and a President with "a messiah complex." At the Baclaran Church in the capital, he preaches against the killings.

Religion is an incredibly powerful force in this overwhelmingly Catholic country, and many of its adherents here attend Mass regularly.

__label__world (CNN) Police in Russia detained at least 1,018 people in nationwide protests against a proposed government pension overhaul Sunday, a Russian independent monitoring group said.

Protesters gathered in cities around Russia to rally against a government proposal to raise the country's retirement age. The protests were organized by supporters of opposition leader Alexei Navalny , who is under administrative arrest for organizing an unsanctioned rally in the capital in January.

The crackdown was heaviest in Russia's second largest city, St. Petersburg, according to independent local media and OVD-Info, a nonprofit organization that monitors detentions. The group said at least 452 people were detained in the city.

Images from the St. Petersburg protests quickly went viral. A local photographer, David Frenkel, confirmed to CNN that he had captured two particularly arresting images: the detention of a school-age boy and an older pensioner.

The largest number of detentions in protests in Russia were reportedly in St. Petersburg.

__label__world (CNN) Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has bowed to pressure from within his own party to drop plans to include carbon emission reduction targets in the government's new energy policy.

The decision to renege on a key part of the government's National Energy Guarantee (NEG) has created a political furor and raised questions about Turnbull's future as leader of the Liberal Party -- and the country.

Turnbull had proposed reducing carbon emissions by 26%, from 2005 levels, by 2030 as part of the NEG, in line with the Paris climate agreement.

However, facing backlash from his Coalition government and the threat of a leadership challenge, Turnbull tried to appease critics Friday by proposing setting emissions reduction targets by regulation instead of legislation.

He took it a step further on Monday, announcing at a press conference that the targets would be scrapped entirely from the the NEG.
__label__world (CNN) Twitter bots supporting the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats have almost doubled in the past month ahead of the Swedish election, according to a government agency.

A study of 571,719 tweets sent during March to August showed the number of accounts with automated behavior "increased significantly" in recent weeks, the Swedish defense research agency said.

The bots were 40% more likely to express support for the Sweden Democrats than genuine accounts, according to the agency. The ruling Social Democrats received the most criticism from the bots, but also came under fire from genuine accounts.

In a trend that echoes other recent elections around the world, both the Sweden Democrats and another far-right party, the Alternative for Sweden, received more support both from genuine and automated accounts than the other parties.

"The general picture that we paint is that these bots were spreading quite a lot of misinformation around the election," Ralph Schroeder, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute and co-author of the study, told CNN. "Much of the conversation is about supporting certain parties, criticism of immigration and refugees, critique of the elites and of the media."

__label__world This is the next installment in the CNN Opinion series on the challenges facing the media, under attack from critics, governments and changing technology.

London (CNN) A few short days ago, here in Britain we marked Armistice Day.

I am sure such ceremonies happen in many other parts of the world, too, but somehow Great Britain seems the fitting place to honor service, sacrifice, and how "the little country that could" gathered its friends in a mighty coalition to defeat monstrous tyranny, not once in the Great War, but again in World War II.

So, observing Remembrance Sunday is an annual exercise in humility, reverence, gratitude and above all, ensuring that so much sacrifice and giving shall never be forgotten.

To witness the Queen and members of the royal family, the Prime Minister, and all her living predecessors, the leaders of all the political parties, the leaders of more than a dozen faiths, the armed services and the dozens of commonwealth nations, all coming together on a cold, sunny Sunday morning to lay the blood-red poppy wreaths at the foot of the Cenotaph in Whitehall, is a stark reminder in our tribal times of a shared humanity, a collective community, with common values and purpose. This one exercise vividly paints the picture of how our democracies have survived.

I always get emotional, but for me the reason this matters so much is because it is also about the men and women of my profession, journalists who have never left the front lines of the battle for truth.

__label__world (CNN) The suspect in Friday's knife attack at Amsterdam's central railway station had a "terrorist motive" and is believed to have acted alone, police in the Netherlands said Saturday.

Police said the suspect is a 19-year-old Afghan man who lives in Germany. Police would only identify him as Jawed S.

Two US citizens were stabbed, US and Dutch authorities said Saturday. The victims were seriously injured but are not in critical condition, the Amsterdam mayor's office said.

Police shot the suspect after the stabbings. A police spokesman told CNN the teenage suspect remains in a hospital, where he will be questioned later Saturday with the help of a translator.

Police in Amsterdam said they are in "intensive contact" with their German counterparts on the case. German authorities did a search of the suspect's house, where they found and seized data storage items that will be analyzed, police said.

__label__world (CNN) The Spanish cabinet approved a decree Friday that would allow the remains of former dictator Francisco Franco to be exhumed and removed from the memorial near Madrid where they have lain since he died in 1975.

Franco's tomb in the Catholic basilica at the Valley of the Fallen, a memorial site created by the dictator to commemorate those who died in the Spanish Civil War, has long been the subject of heated debate in Spain.

The Socialist Party sees the tomb as a shrine to a brutal dictator and, since coming to power in June, has pledged to take action, despite protests from right-wing parties and the Franco Foundation. While Friday's approval was a victory for Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and his new government, the Senate must also approve the decree before it can be implemented.

"The government has approved a decree that modifies two aspects of the 2007 [Historical Memory] law," said Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo at a press conference Friday following the cabinet meeting. "The decree will permit the exhumation of the remains of the dictator Francisco Franco from the place where the victims of the conflict lie," she said, referring to the Valley of the Fallen monument.

A couple take a photo at the Valley of the Fallen monument Friday.

"Having the tomb of Franco there means a lack of respect and peace for the victims who are buried within," Calvo said. "Democracy is not compatible with a state tomb that honors the memory of Franco."

__label__world (CNN) A British-Iranian woman who has been imprisoned in Tehran since 2016 on spying charges returned to prison on Sunday, just three days after she was temporarily released.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe went back to prison voluntarily so that her young daughter did not see her "dragged out of bed in the middle of the night," her husband Richard Ratcliffe said in a statement.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe's temporary release had raised hopes that she would be released unconditionally. But her return to prison represents a setback for her supporters and the "Free Nazanin" campaign in a case that has sparked a diplomatic spat between Great Britain and Iran.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained at Tehran's airport in April 2016 while on her way back to the UK from visiting family with her daughter Gabriella, who was then 22 months old.

The Iranian government accused her of working with organizations allegedly attempting to overthrow the regime. She was sentenced to five years in jail and her child was placed in the care of her parents.

(CNN) Before you woke up this morning, President Donald Trump had already insulted America's closest friends at a gathering of NATO allies in Brussels, Belgium. European leaders said they were expecting a bad summit, but said Trump made it even worse than they feared.

The annual summits used to be an opportunity to reaffirm unity among close friends and work privately to resolve differences in order to solidify an alliance whose success in preserving peace and prosperity is unmatched. Then came Trump, who detonated a hand grenade of discord and acrimony, claiming America's allies are taking advantage of the United States, twisting the facts and doing his best to shout the disagreements over a social media megaphone.

That raises the question, what exactly is Trump trying to do?

If you take Trump at his word, he is simply trying to keep the allies from abusing America's largesse. He wants them to pay more for their own defense. He might even argue that his goal is to make NATO stronger. But a closer look at the facts suggests Trump is trying to achieve precisely the opposite. The President, it appears, is trying to break NATO. He is exaggerating and distorting the financial facts and he is doing it so loudly that he seems to be preparing his supporters at home for a decision that would shake the world and make it a much more dangerous place: withdrawing the United States from the North Atlantic Alliance. That, in effect, would destroy NATO.

Incidentally, that would constitute a triumph for Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, who has publicly stated the obvious, that it would be very good for Russia if NATO were "falling apart."
__label__world (CNN) — Stretching to the horizon, the gray-white earth rises in peaks like a well-whipped meringue petrified into mud and rock.

A keen wind whips these otherworldly hills, while the land underfoot is cracked and scaly.

This could be Mars. But it's Azerbaijan , the mud volcano capital of the world.

Oil-rich region

There are more than 400 volcanoes in this oil-rich country balanced between Europe and Asia, with more being discovered all the time.

Ten years ago, a 12,000-hectare State Nature Reserve was founded on the Absheron Peninsula near the capital Baku.

In July 2018, scientists from Azerbaijan's Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources took CNN Travel on an off-road tour.

Clattering up the precipitous slopes in an off-road vehicle is like a firmer version of the dune-bashing safaris popular next door in the Middle East. But the most thrilling sights are still to come.

We start our tour beside the mouth of Deveboynu volcano, or "Neck of the Camel." The land around is parched, but inside the crater, a muddy slurry -- called mud breccia -- is bubbling gently.

The hills may look peaceful, but below this humped, reptilian landscape, the Earth is breathing and turning like a slumbering beast.

Where tectonic plates collide

Mud volcanoes are usually found in subduction zones -- the parts of the globe where tectonic plates collide, sometimes causing earthquakes, tsunamis and violent eruptions.

Pockets of subterranean gas force their way to the surface, belching out methane and a muddy mix of water and oil.

Mud volcanoes never grow to the size of regular volcanoes. Most are small, ever-changing landforms, often accompanied by peculiar sculptures formed by the spewed out clumps of clay.

These whimsical shapes, says Jeyhun Pashayev, director of the reserve, are "like a picture made by a child."

Strange beauty

"When there are mud volcanoes, it means there are carbohydrogen resources in the deep," explains Pashayev. "As you see, there are lot of mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan which means there are a lot of oil resources."

The arid lands of the Absheron Peninsula might not be as fresh and lush as the mountainous north, but they have their own strange beauty.

This is the region richest in natural resources: both for oil and for the mud breccia, which is used in the chemical and construction industries.

"About 20 of the 50 minerals used in cement" are to be found in the volcanic mud, says Pashayev -- which meant that before the reserve was signed into existence, people regularly stole mud from the site for home building projects.

As we set out on the road again to our next volcanic field, Pashayev gestures towards a huge factory on the horizon, with a large hill of mud to its side. "This, Garadagh, is the richest part of Baku. Around 90% of the stones are being produced here for building the houses. Depending on the quality, it costs from 50 cents to 3 manats ($1.77) per stone."

Mud-bathing

Unlike regular volcanoes, there's no magma or lava, so the liquid mud isn't hot -- instead it usually keeps to a temperate 22/23 C (72 F).

That balminess means that some mud volcanoes are suitable for bathing.

Volcanic clay is sometimes used in the treatment of skin conditions, as well as rheumatism and diseases related to the nervous system.

Pashayev explains that during the Soviet era, the volcanic mud was sometimes used to create casts to treat broken bones.

"Also, you can get super results using the mud volcanoes for the skin," he claims. "You can use [the mud] and get good results, even if you have scars. If the cosmetology doctor can't disappear the scars, mud volcanoes can do this!"

Radioactivity

However, not every gray puddle is skin-friendly.

"Because it comes from deep," says Pashayev, some volcanoes "come with radioactive material. It's not a joke."

Pashayev's team monitors the levels of radioactivity regularly, with safety certification being awarded on an annual basis.

The subterranean world has fascinated people around the globe for millennia, and the strange, violent and seemingly inexplicable behavior of mud volcanoes has long captivated the Azerbaijani people.

The country is known as the Land of Fire -- while Baku is the City of Winds -- and some of the gas leaks in this oil-rich region are constantly on fire, such as at the perpetually burning mountainside of Yanar Dag.

It's believed that the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which centers on fire worship, was closely connected to this phenomena.

In 2001, Lokbutan volcano some 15 kilometers from Baku erupted, sending flames close to 50 feet in the air.

'A mystic thing'

"Mud volcanoes are a mystic thing," says Pashayev. Some years ago, a Danish sound archivist came to the reserve "with a huge device like a piano" to record the sounds from within the volcano.

What Pashayev heard shocked him. "I swear, I thought that this is Hell. I heard human noises -- really. Imagine thousands of people, crying 'help us!' from the deep."

With a similarly evocative turn of phrase, Pashayev also compares the wind sighing through a mud sculpture to the sound made "when you cut the head off a cow" -- a common sight on the backstreets of Baku until butchery regulations were changed earlier this year.

And if the Azerbaijani landscape seems otherworldly, that could be because conditions here aren't dissimilar to Mars.

A number of possible mud volcanoes have been found on Mars , suggesting the presence -- at one time -- of water, and therefore the possibility of life.

'Millions of snakes'

"There are six types of mud volcano," explains Pashayev. "Active. Not active. Oil-producing. Underwater. Island mud volcano. And destroyed mud volcano."

There are around 140 underwater mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan and there are six island volcanoes under the reserve's jurisdiction -- although explains scientist Anar Baghiriv, the team lacks the resources to visit them.

But on one of the island volcanoes, Pashayev explains, the strangest sight isn't the bubbling mud. "From 100 meters, you see that the island is shaking. But when you go close, you see millions of snakes, can you imagine? Millions."

So covered is the island with sea snakes, adds Baghiriv, "You cannot find a place to put your foot."

What lies beneath

Pilpili Gardag is the last stop on our tour. Once we're ushered past the security guard, it's a steep walk uphill to the most dramatic volcano yet.

The slick surface of the mud glistens in the searing July sunshine, with huge gray bubbles forming and then bursting with a satisfying plup.

Mud volcano eruptions vary enormously, from those that quietly, continuously pour out slow streams of slurry, to explosive eruptions that expel thousands of cubic meters at once.

In Azerbaijan, says Pashayev, we have "different sizes, different views, different sculptures. We have all the types, all the forms."

The Guinness Book of Records lists the world's largest mud volcano as being an Azerbaijani one, measuring one kilometer across the base and several hundred kilometers in height.

At Pilipili Gardag, the volatile lunar landscape, with the sun bouncing white off the bleached-out clay and the summer heat sliding towards 40 C (104 F), has an uncanny majesty.

But the real mysteries, the churning, living wonders, are in the many shifting layers beneath our feet.
__label__world Singapore (CNN) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that India is ready to help lead a free and fair Indo-Pacific in a landmark speech Friday, issuing veiled critiques of the region's two biggest players: the United States and China.

In a speech that was short on specifics but big on ambition and lofty rhetoric, Modi hailed Asia as the future of the world economy, while stressing unity between the region's powers amid global economic uncertainty.

"(We must) recognize that each of us can serve our interests better when we work together as equals in the larger good of all nations," said Modi during his keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, an annual defense summit that draws security officials, academics and defense contractors from across the world.

Modi's address marks the first time an Indian politician has been invited to open the annual summit and comes just months after he delivered the opening speech at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting at Davos in January.

"Solutions cannot be found behind walls of protection, but in embracing change," said Modi. "What we seek is a level playing field for all. India stands for open and stable international trade regime."

Underscoring his point, Modi argued that no nation can shape the world on its own. "It is a world that summons us to rise above divisions and competition to work together," said Modi.

"We believe that our common prosperity and security require us to evolve, through dialogue, a common rules-based order for the region. And, it must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons," he said.

Delicate balancing act

Modi is spending three days in the city-state following visits to Malaysia and Indonesia, a trip that analysts say is part of an effort to shore up ties with India's neighbors as China seeks to expand its influence through its trillion dollar Belt and Road initiative.

"India shares geostrategic interests with the Southeast Asian countries," said Bharat Karnad, a national security expert at the Center for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think tank.

"He's firming up India's security relationships without conspicuously targeting China," said Karnard.

China's Belt and Road project is meant to economically link much of Asia, but some -- including many in New Delhi -- believe Beijing is using the investments to expand its soft power and influence across the continent.

Despite India's concerns regarding China's motives when it comes to Belt and Road, relations between the world's two most populous countries have strengthened in recent weeks after a tumultuous 2017 in which Beijing and New Delhi locked horns over a border dispute in the Himalayas

Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in April for an informal two-day relationship-building summit in the Chinese city of Wuhan, an event widely interpreted as a diplomatic reset. Photographs of the two leaders showed them largely at ease, walking through the woods, drinking tea and enjoying a boat ride together.

The talks with President Xi Jinping focussed on diverse areas of India-China cooperation. We discussed ways to give impetus to our economic ties as well as people-to-people relations. Other areas we spoke about include agriculture, technology, energy and tourism. pic.twitter.com/vgvUSjT1XX — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 28, 2018

"India-China cooperation is expanding. Trade is growing. And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border," Modi said in his speech.

"I firmly believe that, Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence."

Despite the praise for its neighbor, India has long viewed China's moves in the region with caution , especially the militarization of islands in the South China Sea, where trillions of dollars worth of trade pass through each year.

"India stands for a free, open, inclusive Indo-Pacific region, which embraces us all in a common pursuit of progress and prosperity. It includes all nations in this geography as also others beyond who have a stake in it," Modi said.

"We should all be equally permitted to benefit from the use of common spaces on sea and in the air without discrimination. When we all agree to live by that code, our sea lanes will be pathways to prosperity and corridors to peace," he said.

Foreign speech, domestic audience

With faltering poll numbers back home, Modi's keynote speech in Singapore provided the prime minister with the ideal platform in which to address a domestic audience and bolster his standing among voters.

"It's part of his attempt to strengthen his reputation as a regional and international statesman who is listened to the world over ," said Karnad.

India is gearing up to go the polls, with elections expected before May next year . Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) though still dominant nationally, has failed to meet expectations in recent local elections.

The BJP failed to gain a majority in mid-May's state-level election in Karnataka , a contest seen as a key barometer in the lead up to the national vote and suffered a loss in a closely watched by-election in the critical state of Uttar Pradesh this week.

Addressing voters in India directly, Modi linked India's global integration to domestic prosperity, promising to sustain the country's economic growth rate of "7.5% to 8% per year" and transform India to "a New India by 2022."
__label__world (CNN) South Korean President Moon Jae-in wants more than just peace with North Korea, he envisions an economic and diplomatic push that will transform northeast Asia to the degree the European Union has shaped that continent.

There are just two problems: he only has one five-year term in office to do so; and the United States, South Korea's most important ally, may not be on board.

As relations between the two Koreas continue to improve, with Moon due to visit Pyongyang next month for a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, negotiations between North Korea and the US have run into trouble. The longer this goes on the greater the potential for a rift to develop between Washington and Seoul.

"Things will definitely get complicated if (and) when the diplomacy seriously stalls," said Oliver Hotham, managing editor of the Korea Risk Group. "There will definitely be those in (Seoul) who will be furious with the US."

Transformative peace

In a speech last week , Moon set out an ambitious economic vision not just on the Peninsula but around the broader region, comparing his plan to the European Coal and Steel Community which eventually gave birth to the EU.

Such a plan would dramatically transform and connect the twin Korean economies, and give South Korea a land link to the rest of the Asian continent, potentially opening up hugely lucrative trading and infrastructure links.

Departing from his previously ebullient praise for US President Donald Trump's role in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table, Moon emphasized "the importance of recognition that we are the protagonists in Korean Peninsula-related issues."

"Developments in inter-Korean relations are not the by-effects of progress in the relationship between the North and the United States," he said. "Rather, advancement in inter-Korean relations is the driving force behind denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

While this may be true, there is a risk that any stall in negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington could hamper the two Koreas' plans. North Korean state media warned last week an ongoing deadlock in talks was "turning the seething expectation and hopes of the world people into impatience and disappointment."

This is largely due to the "natural wedge" which exists between Washington and Seoul, with the former focused on denuclearization above all else and the latter looking towards a broader peace regime, Jeong-ho Roh and Adena Peckler of the Center for Korean Legal Studies at Columbia University said in an email.

"This wedge has not necessarily been developed by North Korea, but North Korea is leveraging it -- by pressuring Seoul to now convince Washington to ease sanctions, while delaying discussion of concrete steps for denuclearization," they added.

In an editorial Tuesday, the North Korean state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said "the adoption of a war-end declaration is a task that brooks no further delay."

"Its adoption is of weighty significance in ensuring the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world, to say nothing of the confidence-building between (North Korea) and the US and the improvement of their relations," it said.

In a statement made to CNN Wednesday, a South Korean government spokesman said Washington and Seoul "have been in very close coordination and cooperation in the process of building peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula including a declaration of the end of the Korean War."

Treaty tribulations

Technically, the Korean War which broke out in 1950 has not ended, a 1953 armistice agreement stopped fighting but did not evolve into a legally binding peace treaty.

Both Koreas have made clear their desire for just such a treaty, and Moon has promised to declare an end to the war by the end of this year, perhaps during his trip to the North next month.

While a formal peace regime officially ending the Korean War would need buy in from the US and China -- the other participants in the conflict -- experts agree that there is nothing to stop the two Koreas declaring an end to the war themselves, or signing a bilateral peace treaty.

Both Koreas shut down a handful of guard posts along the DMZ Wednesday, according to officials in Seoul, part of a process of gradual demilitarization of the heavily fortified border.

This could enable South Korea to lift sanctions and move forward with greater economic engagement with the North, plans for which Moon has been promoting. That would leave Washington in an awkward spot, Roh and Peckler said, "the US can either not recognize a bilateral peace treaty as a legitimate and legal end to the Korean War, or actively block South Korea from signing it."

Doing so could alienate Seoul and the broader international community, and leave North Korea to take "center stage in the establishment of an internationally recognized peace process at the exclusion of the United States."

Seoul's desire to continue ramping up economic engagement stems from Moon's insistence that doing so will benefit not only his country's northern neighbor but also South Korea itself.

In his speech last week, he cited research from a state-run organization which found inter-Korean economic cooperation could be worth upwards of $150 billion across the next 30 years.

Most important, for Moon as well as business and worker interests in the South , is the linking of rail networks, ending South Korea's geographic isolation and connecting it to China and the rest of the Asian continent.

"I propose the creation of the East Asian Railroad Community today, encompassing six Northeast Asian countries and the United States," Moon said. "The Community will expand the horizon of the Korean economy to the northern part of the continent and become the main artery of mutual prosperity in Northeast Asia. It will then lead to the creation of East Asian energy and economic communities."

Stalled talks

The Rodong Sinmun complained last week of "those opposed to dialogue provided the (US) negotiating team with a truncheon called 'theory of suspected north Korea's secret nuclear facilities,' a fiction, driving it to derailing dialogue."

This conforms with reports citing unnamed administration officials that the US has requested a full accounting of North Korea's nuclear assets before moving forward with talks or any potential economic relief.

Around the same time, the US moved to sanction companies based in Singapore, China and Russia accused of violating restrictions on trade with Pyongyang, as Washington attempted to maintain its strategy of "maximum pressure" which the Trump administration has claimed let to the detente with North Korea in the first place.

This has led many observers to expect an imminent collapse in talks, with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) saying the most likely scenario is that at some point in the near future negotiations "fall apart owing to misaligned expectations and distrust."

"The levels of bilateral trust and long-term commitment required for a phased denuclearization scenario are unlikely to be achieved under the current US administration," EIU analyst Anwita Basu said.

If they are to be saved, it will likely fall to Moon to do so, repeating the South Korean President's previous role in salvaging the Singapore summit after Trump abruptly called it off in May

"South Korea can really play the good cop to Washington's bad cop, being a more sympathetic ear to Trump's hard line on denuclearization," said Hotham. "There's certainly disagreement between Seoul and Washington on the speed at which all this peace stuff should unfold, but that disagreement actually helps this dynamic in many ways."

Moon may lose patience however, if Washington dragging its feet on reaching a compromise with Pyongyang means a significant delay to his plans for economic engagement, which depend on lifting at least some sanctions in the near term. And he may not be the only one.

"If some forces in Seoul as well as those in Beijing and Moscow want to see the peace process move faster than the denuclearization process then this could be a potentially challenging point of contention," said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

While Kim was skeptical of how much of a wedge a bilateral peace treaty would be, she agreed that Moon's plan can only be achieved via sanctions relief, though she added that if there is widespread dissatisfaction with the speed of the overall peace process "Beijing and Moscow could very well lift sanctions and not implement their obligations under UN security council resolutions."

Nor are other parties likely to be willing to see a return to the threats and saber-rattling which characterized Trump's earlier approach to North Korea, leaving the US President potentially sidelined on the one foreign policy issue he has seen the most success on.

__label__world (CNN) The world's first plastic-free supermarket aisle was unveiled in Amsterdam today as pressure to curb the world's plastic binge and its devastating impact on the planet continues to grow.

With nearly 700 plastic-free goods to select from at one of the branches of Ekoplaza, a Dutch supermarket chain, the aisle gives shoppers the opportunity to buy their groceries in "new compostable bio-materials as well as traditional materials" such as glass, metal and cardboard.

Sian Sutherland, co-founder of the environmental campaign group A Plastic Planet , which advocates for a plastic-free aisle in every supermarket, says the aisle is "a symbol of what the future of food retailing will be" and hopes it has a knock-on effect.

Sutherland says she recognizes that transitioning from plastic to other materials requires a monumental shift from big retailers, but that not acknowledging the need for change is no longer acceptable.

"We totally understand what we're asking for is highly inconvenient -- it's difficult," she says. "However, it's indefensible for us to continue to wrap up our perishable food and drink in this indestructible material of plastic. So everybody knows now that progress has to be made."
__label__world Now that President Donald Trump's travel ban has the Supreme Court's blessing, the fate of people in the seven already designated countries appears dire when it comes to their chances of coming to the United States.

While it's difficult to pin down who may or may not intend to visit, study or even become an immigrant to America, the most recent data available from the US State Department provides a window into ballpark figures.

During the 2017 fiscal year, the government issued about 87,000 "non-immigrant" visas from the seven nations affected by the administration's travel ban. Those include people ranging from tourists to students to those doing business in the United States (There were 9.7 million such visas issued worldwide during the fiscal year).

While much of the attention has focused on the ban's aim at Muslim-majority nations, the largest contingent of non-immigrant visas actually went to Venezuela. In fact, Venezuela had nearly twice as many visas as all the other countries combined.

Here are the individual countries broken down:

Iran — 19,801

North Korea — 55

Syria — 5,411

Libya — 1,552

Yemen — 2,919

Somalia — 276

Venezuela — 56,720

The picture is quite different for those seeking to immigrate. Of about 20,000 immigrant visas granted in fiscal year 2017 to those coming from the seven countries, the largest contingents are actually from Iran and Yemen, State Department records show. Venezuela is in the middle of the pack, roughly the same as those from Syria.

The total number of immigrant visas worldwide by the US was about 560,000 during that period, so the seven countries still make up just a fraction of the total.

(CNN) In the dead of night and with help from countries including the United States, Canada, Jordan, Israel and the United Kingdom, the rescuers got rescued themselves . Almost immediately, the Syrian regime and its Russian backers criticized the operation. And the White Helmets.

But no amount of online targeting from the Syrian regime or its Russian backers can change the fact that these ordinary people from a whole slew of backgrounds came together as the White Helmets to rescue civilians in the midst of war — for years and at great risk to themselves. The White Helmets deserved rescue.

Indeed, the extraction of more than 400 Syrian Civil Defense members -- known as White Helmets -- from Syria this week as the Syrian regime neared their location was a rare reminder that countries can indeed work together effectively to protect people who have worked to help and to save others. That the Syrian regime called their rescue a " criminal operation " should surprise few and confuse even fewer.

The reason they earned the label is twofold: for the last half-decade, not only did they help rescue people in the aftermath of attacks by the Syrian regime, but they also documented what was happening on the ground, sharing what they saw with local and international organizations and chronicling events such as the April 2017 chemical weapons attack in Khan Sheikhoun

"While the Syrian-Russian military coalition conducted indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations in areas like Eastern Ghouta Idlib and now, Daraa and Quneitra , the White Helmets were pulling the injured from under rubble, burying the dead, putting out fires, and conducting countless search and rescue operations," noted Human Rights Watch. "They bore witness to many of the atrocities that characterized the conflict."

The White Helmets, formed in late 2012 and early 2013, are a volunteer force that has grown from a few dozen to several thousand members from multiple walks of life, from blacksmiths to barbers. Some 200 members of the group have been killed in the process of daring to go toward danger rather than away from it, running to try to rescue civilians in the immediate aftermath of aerial attacks.

As CNN's Hala Gorani noted , "Some of the defining images of the civil war, of bloodied bodies covered head to toe in concrete dust -- yet miraculously alive --- have come from the very people who have saved them."

For this work bearing witness -- captured in a Netflix documentary and in international media -- they were called " terrorists " by the Syrian government. And they bore the brunt of Russian propaganda starting in 2015 as the Russians ratcheted up their efforts inside Syria to protect and advance the interests of the Syrian regime by air and on the ground.

The White Helmets were accused of being linked to al Qaeda. Called "crisis actors." Accused of staging "fake attacks." And trolled mercilessly online.

The Guardian last December called these efforts to discredit the White Helmets an " extraordinary disinformation campaign " as it noted researchers "found evidence of a targeted Russian influence campaign against the White Helmets." One computer science professor at Indiana University, Fil Menczer, developed a tool called Hoaxy to chart the spread of misinformation online. Searching for "White Helmets" reveals a handful of sources generated hundreds of stories about the organization. "It's like a factory," he told the paper.

Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of the rescue of the search-and-rescuers, the Russian Embassy in Israel tweeted , "July 22 West evacuated #WhiteHelmets pseudo-humanitarians via #Israel. These militants acted exclusively in areas controlled by Islamic radicals,concocted #fakenews, staged chemical provocations like in #EasternGhouta. They flee #Syria and reveal who they are."

Yes. They revealed who they are: regular people who regularly devoted themselves to clearing others out from under rubble. People whose work led to the creation of an unusual international alliance to get them out of danger. And people whose daring rescue showed once more the power of something we haven't seen in a while: just how much good is possible when countries work together.
__label__world (CNN) Even before Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano called for Pope Francis to resign on Sunday, the two men had a history, and it wasn't good.

Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, angered some church officials in 2015 by arranging a meeting at the Vatican's embassy in Washington between the Pope and Kim Davis , the Kentucky clerk who refused to sign same-sex marriage certificates.

During his trip to the United States, the Pope had tried to stay above the country's culture wars. Vigano foisted Francis right into the fray. The Vatican, which tried to distance the Pope from Davis, was displeased. Two years later, Francis quietly accepted Vigano's resignation.

On Sunday, Vigano struck back.

In an 11-page "testimony" released to conservative Catholic media, Vigano accused Francis of ignoring his warnings about Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, who led the Archdiocese of Washington from 2000-2006. Under Francis' orders, McCarrick resigned from the College of Cardinals last month after accusations that he molested an altar boy and seminarians.

But Vigano said the Pope earlier had lifted restrictions on McCarrick put in place by Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned in 2015.

"In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church," Vigano wrote, "he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick's abuses and resign along with all of them."

Vigano's accusations come as Francis and his church are trying to contain a quickly escalating sexual abuse crisis that has spread from Australia to Pennsylvania. In Ireland, a country devastated by its own clergy abuse scandals, the Pope repeatedly apologized last weekend for the sins and crimes of church leaders, lamenting that "some members of the hierarchy didn't own up to these painful situations and kept silent."

On the plane ride home, the Pope himself kept silent about Vigano's accusations.

"I will not say a single word about this," he said. "I believe the statement speaks for itself. And you have the sufficient journalistic ability to make your conclusions. It's an act of trust."

While journalists dig for the truth, and the Pope keeps silent, Vigano's letter has emerged as a sort of Rorschach test for Catholics : Many conservative Catholics say the Pope must go. Liberal Catholics accuse the archbishop of launching a coup d'etat against his boss.

"This is a coup operation against Pope Francis," said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of Catholic history and theology at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.

"It is a stunning convergence between the personal agenda of Vigano and the theological agenda of those who do not like Pope Francis."

Turning the tables on Vigano, the Archdiocese of Washington suggested his tenure in the United States should itself be investigated

A 2014 memo shows that Vigano himself demanded that evidence be destroyed in an attempt to end an investigation against a former archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis, according to CNN Vatican analyst John Allen

But the Bishop of Phoenix, the Most Rev. Thomas J. Olmsted, issued a statement defending Vigano, whom he said he has known since 1979.

"Although I have no knowledge of the information that he reveals in his written testimony of August 22, 2018, so I cannot personally verify its truthfulness, I have always known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity," Olmsted wrote.

A 'hit list'

Even before he tussled with Francis, Vigano was adept at courting controversy.

In 2011, when he ran the Vatican City State, the Italian churchman clashed with his superiors, accusing Vatican officials of corruption. The charges became enmeshed in the Vatileaks scandal, when former Pope Benedict's butler leaked documents detailing the infighting.

"Vigano presented himself as a whistle blower," said John Thavis, who was the Rome bureau chief for Catholic News Service at the time. "But he also had a persecution complex. He saw conspiracy theories all around him."

Thavis said Benedict didn't seem impressed by Vigano's views. "He sent him 4,000 miles away, to the United States."

Vigano was appointed the Vatican's US ambassador in October 2011. For the most part, he kept a low profile, though some accused the archbishop of breaking with church protocol by appearing at an anti-gay marriage rally at the Supreme Court. (Typically, Vatican ambassadors -- known as nuncios -- do not publicly involve themselves in another country's internal political debates.)

Besides representing the Pope, nuncios typically advise popes on whom to appoint as bishops.

In his letter Sunday, Vigano seemed bitter that Francis had relied on other Vatican officials for recommendations, saying that "the nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops."

Instead, Vigano said, the appointment of several bishops to top posts in Chicago and New Jersey were "orchestrated" by McCarrick and his successor in Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, as well as Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga, a Honduran who is one of the Pope's closest advisers.

More salaciously, Vigano said the Catholic Church is plagued by "homosexual networks" that "act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church."

Those "networks," Vigano said, were complicit in a "conspiracy of silence" that allowed McCarrick's and others' alleged abuses to continue.

In statements, Wuerl of Washington and Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, both of whom were named in Vigano's letter, denied any allegations against them.

"The factual errors, innuendo and fearful ideology of the 'testimony,' serve to strengthen our conviction to move ahead resolutely in protecting the young and vulnerable from any sort of abuse," Tobin said , "while guaranteeing a safe and respectful environment where all are welcome and breaking down the structures and cultures that enable abuse."

The fact that most of the bishops Vigano criticizes are well-known liberals has led some church experts to suspect his motives.

"This letter is a hit list," said Faggioli. "It's all the people he thinks are bad for the church because of their 'homosexual agenda.'"

Apparently, that includes Pope Francis.

Vigano saves most of his ammunition for the Pope, who he says he told in 2013 that McCarrick was "a serial predator" but "continued to cover for him."

But the Pope didn't cover for McCarrick. Unlike his predecessors, Francis forced the former cardinal to resign in July.

And Thavis said Vigano's assertions about Benedict putting restrictions on McCarrick, including not allowing him to participate in church events or celebrate Mass in public, are patently false.

"McCarrick appeared at several high-profile events with Benedict," he said.

Still, Thavis and Faggioli, as well as other church experts, said the Vatican should respond in detail to Vigano's charges, even if the Pope himself refuses to do so.

"They still need to answer some questions," Faggioli said. "This is something that cannot be ignored."
__label__world (CNN) Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced a $60 billion package of aid, investment and loans to Africa, against a backdrop of growing concern about rising debt distress from Chinese loans to the continent.

The announcement was made during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing, a triennial meeting between senior Chinese leaders and their counterparts from across Africa.

The financial package is the same amount Beijing pledged at the previous FOCAC summit in 2015, and is in line with analysts' expectations that Xi would not vastly increase the amount of Chinese money flowing into Africa.

Over the past nearly two decades, the numbers coming out of FOCAC have generally risen with each event. The pledge in 2015 was three times the figure announced at the 2012 forum.

Jeremy Stevens, international economist for the Standard Bank Group, said many felt it would not be "politically appropriate" to pledge huge loans given concern that Africa is becoming overloaded with Chinese debt.
__label__world (CNN) Ugandan youth movement leader Bobi Wine has arrived in the United States for medical treatment after being blocked from travel earlier in the week by Ugandan police, the pop star-turned-MP confirmed in a tweet Saturday.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, posted a photo of himself at an airport on Twitter and Facebook. In the photo, he is seated in a wheelchair.

An attorney for Wine, Robert Amsterdam, told CNN that Wine arrived in Boston, and will later travel to Washington.

Wine had attempted to travel to the US on Thursday but was prevented from boarding his flight and was taken away in a police vehicle to a government-owned hospital in the capital of Kampala with limited access to his family, one of his attorneys, Erias Lukwago, told CNN.

In his tweet, Wine wrote: "Safely arrived in the US where I'll be receiving specialised treatment following the brutal torture at the hands of SFC soldiers. We thank the world for standing with us. I will soon tell you what exactly happened to me since 13th August and what is next."

__label__world (CNN) A Philippines lawmaker is set to spend a second night holed up in the Senate Wednesday after the country's president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced he was seeking his arrest over coup attempts that happened over a decade ago.

Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a long standing and vocal critic of Duterte, told CNN he would remain in the Senate where he remains under the protection of Senate leaders while his lawyers examined his options.

As night fell, armed police officers stood guard outside the building awaiting for Trillanes to leave, according to CNN Philippines.

The senator received amnesty in 2011 under President Benigno Aquino for his involvement in three coups attempts in 2003, 2006 and 2007 during Gloria Arroyo's presidency.

In an advertisement in national newspaper Manila Times, Duterte said clemency for the senator had been voided due to his "failure to apply for amnesty and refusal to admit his guilt."

Trillanes told CNN that he considered the proclamation to be based on "questionable and outright baseless lies," and said he and his legal team would "question the validity and legality of this presidential declaration through the Supreme Court."

He added that, along with video evidence of his filing his request for amnesty, he was in possession of a certificate of amnesty given to him by the Aquino administration.

"The application was processed having satisfied all the requirements, a certificate of the amnesty was given to me, that is the proof of its validity."

Regardless, he said he would comply with the Justice Department should he be arrested. "I will not resist arrest. I will not escape," he said.

He is not the first opponent of the president to be threatened with arrest -- in 2017 staunch Duterte opponent Leila De Lima was arrested after having been accused of abetting the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison when she was justice secretary from 2010 to 2015.

She has consistently insisted she has no involvement in the illegal drug trade.

Part of Duterte's proclamation as published in the Manila Times.

Return to AFP?

Opposition party member Gary Alejano called on the country's security forces to refrain from following "illegal" orders from the President.

"The president is not above the Constitution. And I am calling the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) and the PNP (Philippine National Police) that they should not follow illegal orders," he told reporters, according to CNN Philippines.

Trillanes, a former naval officer, was involved in three mutiny attempts during the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo: the Oakwood mutiny in July 2003, the Marines standoff in February 2006, and the Manila Peninsula incident in 2007.

Former President Benigno Aquino III told CNN Philippines that Trillanes had applied for amnesty for his role in the uprisings and his case had been reviewed. He was found to have qualified.

Trillanes resigned from the military when he ran for the Senate. However, in the wake of the Presidential proclamation, the Department of National Defense (DND) has said Trillanes could be tried again before a court martial.

A DND spokesman told CNN Philippines that as a member of the military facing trial, "Trillanes should be detained at the AFP custodial center, but the Senate is insisting it has jurisdiction over the senator."

In response, Senate President Tito Sotto said they would not allow Trillanes to be arrested inside the Senate premises.

"To preserve the dignity of the Senate, we have to not allow any senator to be arrested in the Senate premises. Outside the Senate premises, that's no longer our concern, but within the Senate premises, that's the decision of the leadership," he told members of the media.

Supporters rally

Vice President Leni Robredo, another staunch critic of President Duterte (the role is independently voted for on the presidential ticket) denounced the arrest warrant as a political ploy to silence dissenters.

"The decision of the Palace to declare as void the amnesty granted to Senator Antonio Trillanes IV is another proof that the administration would do everything to silence those who oppose it," she said in a statement.

Trillanes told CNN that he was "truly humbled by the outpouring of support... the Vice President and former President Aquino, these are very significant pillars of our society at this point.

"Particularly for Aquino, he's the one who granted me the amnesty. He should be the one able to decide if I complied."

He said that his situation was not as grave as when he was first faced the charges, but he was worried about Duterte's dismantling of the country's democratic institutions.

"Once we let him get away with it then we're almost in a de facto martial law or dictatorship," he said.
__label__world Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) The founder of the notorious Taliban-linked Haqqani network, which for decades was responsible for kidnappings and suicide bombings against the United States and its allies, has died, the Taliban has said.

A statement distributed by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid to journalists said Jalaluddin Haqqani passed away "after a long battle with illness," adding he had been "ill and bed-ridden for the past several years."

He passed operational control of the network to his son Siraj many years ago, who then became the number-two ranked commander in the Taliban.

The Haqqani network was formally designated a terrorist organization by the United States in 2012.

A picture dated 02 April 1991 shows Afghan commander Jalaluddin Haqqani (center) at his Pakistani base in Miram Shah with Amin Wardak and Abdul Haq, two top guerilla commanders.

The network, which is based in Waziristan, a tribal area of Pakistan, is linked with both the Taliban and al Qaeda. It also operates across the border in Afghanistan.

__label__world London (CNN) When an American actress marries a prince, the world watches. And Meghan Markle , who is soon to wed Britain's Prince Harry , is not the first.

On April 4, 1956, hundreds of journalists gathered at New York's waterfront to catch a glimpse of Grace Kelly as the Oscar-winning actress boarded the ocean liner that would take her to Europe -- and to the man she was engaged to marry, Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.

"It was the harbor's biggest shipside news conference in 30 years," writes Robert Lacey in his biography of Kelly. "The whole country was mesmerized."

The couple's fairy-tale wedding two weeks later was broadcast to over 30 million television viewers in Europe alone, according to Lacey.

More than six decades on, a similar fairy tale is mesmerizing people around the world. Unlike Kelly, Markle will not officially become a princess, but to most, that hardly matters.

Like Kelly, Markle is described as passionate and beautiful -- and a woman who knows what she wants.

What else does she share with America's most famous princess bride?

The outsider

Markle, 36, is no stereotypical princess. She's American, divorced and biracial (she has an African-American mother, Doria Ragland, and a white father, Thomas Markle).

She grew up in Los Angeles, 2,700 miles from Kelly's home city of Philadelphia. But her school, Immaculate Heart High School, a Catholic school for girls, was just a short walk from the Hollywood studios that propelled Kelly to stardom.

Both acted from a young age and forged successful on-screen careers before crossing an ocean and entering an entirely new world.

When Grace Kelly became Princess Grace, she "put Monaco on the map," says royal historian Carolyn Harris.

"Meghan is an outsider (in the royal family), and I think that's only a good thing," says Anna Whitelock, royal historian at Royal Holloway, University of London. "She has a unique perspective."

Kelly, who was just 26 when she married her prince, reportedly struggled to feel accepted by Monaco's high society, and some of its royals.

"Grace Kelly came up against the established traditions that existed in Monaco," says Carolyn Harris, royal historian and author of the book "Raising Royalty."

"Both as a foreigner and as an actress, she found she inadvertently offended people."

In contrast, Harris sees Britain's royals making a big effort to create a supportive atmosphere for their newest member.

Markle herself has spoken of the warm welcome she has received from Prince Harry's family.

"The family has been great," she said in a joint interview with her fiancé , filmed and broadcast on the day they announced their engagement, adding that she was starting to feel "a part of not just the institution but also part of the family."

Markle spent Christmas Day with the royals in 2017, unusual for someone who hasn't yet married into the family.

Harris attributes this difference mostly to cultural shifts.

"This marriage gives a sense of just how much social and cultural change has taken place over the course of Queen Elizabeth's life," says Harris. "The royal family is now much more inclusive in terms of who can be a member."

Whitelock believes Markle, as an outsider, can help push that process even further -- and likens her to Harry's mother, Princess Diana, in that regard.

"Diana held a mirror up to (the royal family). She forced them to change and modernize and look outwards. I think Meghan will also be a force for good."

The actress

"Princess or actress -- take your choice," Lacey writes in his biography of Kelly. "Grace could not be both."

While Markle has not reached the same heights as Kelly -- who starred in 11 movies and won an Oscar for her performance in "The Country Girl" (1954) -- she has built a successful career as an actress, most notably starring as Rachel Zane in seven seasons of television drama "Suits."

Markle played paralegal Rachel Zane in seven seasons of "Suits" from 2011 to 2018.

But for Markle, like Kelly, relinquishing that career was a step on the path to becoming a royal. While Kelly reportedly seemed reluctant to wholly give up her former life and later tried to return to acting, Markle has spoken positively of the shift.

"I don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change," she said in the engagement interview. "It's a new chapter."

Harris says Markle's experience in the world of celebrity will help both her and the royal family in the transition process. "She's used to being in the public eye and that's an asset for the royal family," she says.

But Meghan still faces a big transition, Whitelock says. "She comes from a very different world -- a world of Hollywood and celebrity and acting," she says. "There will need to be a pivot on her part from promotion of Meghan Markle to promotion of the monarchy and the royal family."

Kelly's performance in "The Country Girl" won her an Oscar for Best Actress in 1955.

Lacey's book suggests Kelly found that process a challenge. And, as Markle has also remarked, a headline-making career as an actress does not prepare a person for the scrutiny and press attention faced by a princess.

"As naïve as it sounds now, I did not have any understanding of just what it would be like," Markle said in November, adding with a nod to her fiancé: "I don't think either of us did."

As Harry's wife, Meghan will never be off the press radar -- especially if the couple start a family, as they say they intend to. "They will have to try to strike a balance between public and private," says Harris. "There will be tremendous public fascination if they have children."

The feminist

Talking to Lacey, actress Rita Gram described Kelly as "one of the first independent women in America... She left her home, she earned her own living, she made the bed."

The biography tells of a woman who sought to be self-sufficient and self-determining, a daunting prospect in 1950s America. While many battles for female independence have since been fought and (largely) won, Markle shows a similar disinclination to bow to patriarchal norms.

"She's a mature, very independent, very articulate woman," says Whitelock, who notes that Markle spoke more than her fiancé in their engagement interview and showed great self-assurance. "It's a partnership of equals."

Markle seems to have "a strong sense of self," says Harris.

Markle has also been a vocal advocate for gender equality since childhood and in February declared her intention to "hit the ground running" with her work to empower girls and women across the UK.

Indeed, with the passage of 60 years and the accompanying cultural shifts, "Princess" Meghan finds herself with far more freedom than Princess Grace, both as an individual woman and in her female advocacy projects.

Of course, Kelly was marrying the monarch, while Markle will be wife to a man who is unlikely ever to be king (Harry is sixth in line to the throne). Markle can speak, dress and act more freely than her Philadelphian counterpart.

"Grace saw her royal duty as being the model corporate wife to her husband," wrote Lacey. And later: "She was very good at smiling, at being dignified and stylish... But that, Grace now knew, was just about all that being a princess had to offer."

Princess Grace of Monaco and Prince Rainier III of Monaco meet the media during a trip to Atlantic City, five months after their wedding.

While Markle will have scope to be far more than her husband's accessory, she does also face a raft of unavoidable new restrictions and protocols. "Her entire life will be scheduled well in advance," says Harris. "That reduces the scope for spontaneity."

And what Markle can say -- and where -- is now much more limited. "Her days of winning fans by documenting her life on a blog are over," Whitelock observes, adding that the act of closing down her lifestyle website The Tig last year "is indicative of a bigger closing down."

The humanitarian

Lacey recounts how Kelly threw herself into charitable work in the years after her wedding, making frequent visits to Monaco's orphanages, hospitals and homes for the elderly, becoming president of Monaco's Red Cross and founding a charity that lobbied for the rights of children.

For decades, royals across the world have used their unique position to shine a spotlight on particular causes -- and the UK's young royals are no different. It's a role Markle is well prepared for.

In 2016 she became a global ambassador for World Vision and traveled to Rwanda to see the impact of the charity's clean-water initiatives. A year earlier, she was named the UN Women's Advocate for Political Participation and Leadership.

Whitelock believes Markle is showing the right character for charitable work too. "She's shown a real sense of ease with people. She doesn't have the kind of stuffiness or the nervousness of the other royals on their early outings... She will reach out to people."

Markle "clearly connects with people," says Whitelock. On this occasion, she was meeting members of the public during a trip to Northern Ireland with Prince Harry.

And while Kelly seemed to do most of her charitable work alone, Harry and Meghan are clearly planning a joint assault on the world's problems.

"It was really one of the first things we connected on," Markle recalled in the engagement interview. "One of the first things we started talking about when we met was just the different things we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change."

"That's what got date two in the books," she added, smiling.

And since "date two," back in July 2016, the pair have had a lot of time to get to know each other, to become the "fantastic team" Harry says they are, and for Meghan to acclimatize to the reality of her new role.

Markle "is entering this open-eyed," says Whitelock. "She's coming to this as a very well-equipped princess."
__label__world (CNN) Here's a look at World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945.

The treaties worked out in Paris at the end of World War I satisfied few. Germany, Austria, and the other countries on the losing side of the war were especially unhappy with the Paris Agreement, which required them to give up arms and make reparations. Germany agreed to sign the Treaty of Versailles only after the victorious countries threatened to invade if Germany did not sign it. Germany made the last payment on reparations in 2010.

Economic Issues - World War I was devastating to countries' economies. Although the European economy had stabilized by the 1920s, the Great Depression in the United States led to economic downfall in Europe. Communism and fascism gained strength in the wake of economic problems.

Nationalism - An extreme form of patriotism that grew in Europe became even stronger after World War I, especially for countries that were defeated.

Political unrest and unfavorable economic conditions lead to the rise of dictatorships in countries such as Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union.

Failure of Appeasement - Czechoslovakia had become an independent nation after World War I, but by 1938, was surrounded by German territory. Hitler wanted to annex the Sudetenland, an area in western Czechoslovakia where many Germans lived. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain wanted to appease Hitler and agreed to his demands for the Sudetenland after Hitler promised he would not demand more territory. Hitler seized the rest of Czechoslovakia in March of 1939.

Axis Powers:

Germany, Japan, and Italy formed a coalition called the Axis Powers. Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and two German-created states--Croatia and Slovakia--eventually joined.

Major Players:

Germany - Adolf Hitler, Der Furher

Japan - Admiral Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister

Italy - Benito Mussolini, Prime Minister Adolf Hitler, Der FurherAdmiral Hideki Tojo, Prime MinisterBenito Mussolini, Prime Minister

Allied Powers:

The United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union made up the Allies, the group fighting the Axis. Between 1939 and 1944 at least 50 nations would eventually fight together. Thirteen more nations would join by 1945 including: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, British Commonwealth of Nations, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Philippines and Yugoslavia.

Other Facts:

About 70 million people fought in the armed forces of the Allied and Axis nations.

Finland never officially joined either the Allies or the Axis and was at war with the Soviet Union at the outbreak of World War II. Needing help in 1940, the Finnish joined forces with Nazi Germany to repel the Soviets. When peace between Finland the Soviet Union was declared in 1944, Finland joined with the Soviets to oust the Germans.

Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Sweden declared neutrality during the war.

The Soviet Union lost the most soldiers, in excess of seven million.

The number of civilian casualties in World War II may never be known. Many deaths were caused by bombing raids, massacres, starvation and other war-related causes.

The Lend-Lease Act was created to allow the United States to lend or lease weapons, equipment or raw materials to any nation fighting the Axis. Eventually, 38 nations received about $50 billion in aid. Most went to Great Britain and the Soviet Union.

In 1948, the United States created the Marshall Plan to help rebuild war torn Europe. Eventually, 18 nations received $13 billion in food, machinery and other goods.

In March of 1974, Hiroo Onoda , a Japanese soldier still fighting the war, was found by a search party on the island of Lubang in the Philippines. After he is convinced the war is over by his former commanding officer, he is then flown to Manila and formally surrenders to President Ferdinand Marcos. Onoda died January 16, 2014, at the age of 91.

__label__world (CNN) Last year was officially the Earth's warmest since record-keeping began in the 1880s, the World Meteorological Organization announced Wednesday morning.

That means 2016 set a global heat record for the third year in a row according to NOAA and NASA, who held a joint press conference on Wednesday to discuss the record.

Not only was this the third consecutive year to rank hotter than all previous years, it also means 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to NOAA. To put this in perspective, the last time we had a record cold year was 1911.

Temperatures over the Earth's continents and oceans in 2016 were 1.1 degree Celsius (1.98 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average, according to the WMO. That means we are already a majority of the way to the 1.5-degree warming goal set at the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015

Climate scientists say greenhouse gas pollution, which humans are creating primarily by burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests, likely contributed to the 2016 record.

And the pollution certainly is behind the long-term trend toward warming, scientists say.

"(T)he spate of record-warm years that we have seen in the 21st century can only be explained by human-caused climate change," said Michael Mann, director of the Earth Science Center at Pennsylvania State University.

"The effect of human activity on our climate is no longer subtle. It's plain as day, as are the impacts -- in the form of record floods, droughts, superstorms and wildfires -- that it is having on us and our planet."

Humans are contributing to warming

A record El Niño lasting from 2015 into 2016 played a role in further pushing the planet's temperature higher. El Niños are weather phenomena that warm the Pacific Ocean and pump lots of excess heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.

JUST WATCHED The science behind El Niño Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The science behind El Niño 01:26

But El Niño is only one factor in the warming of the planet.

And climate scientists say it is a relatively small one when compared to the role that humans are playing.

"The record is due to a combination of the (natural) strong 2015-2016 El Niño (warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean surface) and the strong global warming trend that has continued from 1970 to the present," James Hansen, former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told CNN.

But "the human-caused, long-term warming trend is the bigger contributor," he added.

To come up with its figures the WMO combined different global temperature datasets from various sources, including NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office and the European weather and climate center, ECMWF.

Despite using different methods to compile and analyze the temperatures, all those agencies reached the same conclusion -- that 2016 "continued the long-term trend of warming we have seen since the 1970s ... and have not paused in any way," said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

Arctic is warming faster

While the warming for the planet was just over 1 degree Celsius, the Arctic continued to warm much faster, with temperatures more than 3 degrees Celsius -- 5.4 degrees F -- above what they were in previous decades.

"The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average" according to the WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, and "we have also broken sea ice minimum records in the Arctic and Antarctic."

The polar warmth is not just a problem for the polar bears, it lead an entire village in Alaska to vote to relocate

And the impacts extent much further.

The coast of their barrier island is thawing and falling into the sea, among other issues. Hide Caption 1 of 18 Photos: Shelton and Clara Kokeok are among the residents who say they won't leave the town, about 30 miles from the Arctic Circle.

Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: The Kokeoks live in a small blue house at the very edge of the barrier island, which is accessible only by plane much of the year.

Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Relocating the village would be too expensive, said Percy Nayokpuk, who owns a store in town. Shipping costs would increase if residents moved to the mainland. Still, he said, "I think to deny that there's climate change is wrong. Climate change is happening." Hide Caption 10 of 18 Photos: There are two stores in town, both stocked primarily by plane.

"The persistent loss of sea ice is driving weather, climate and ocean circulation patterns in other parts of the world. We also have to pay attention to the potential release of methane from melting permafrost," said Taalas.

What about 2017...and beyond?

Many scientists believe 2017 is unlikely to break the record for a fourth consecutive year.

That's because El Nino, a natural phenomenon that creates more warming, may not be present this year.

That doesn't mean climate change has stopped, though.

Humans continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, warming the planet in the long term.

And Schmidt said on Wednesday that 2017 is still likely to be "a top-5 year" for global temperatures.

"Though some years will be warmer than others, the overall trend over multiple decades will inevitably be upward as long of concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere keep increasing," said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

Climate models consistently show that if CO2 continues to be released into the atmosphere at the current rate, temperatures will continue to climb well above 2 degrees Celsius, according to the latest from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

Politics of record heat

Meanwhile, it seems unlikely the world's second-biggest climate polluter, the Untied States, will shift away from fossil fuels soon. As news of the hottest year on record circulated the Internet, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, testified on Capitol Hill.

Trump has called for the United States to scrap the Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to "green" the world's economy; and the Clean Power Plan, which aims to clean up power plants in the United States.

The American public, meanwhile, favors more action on this issue.

Critically, the poll found 60% of Americans realize climate change already is affecting the weather.

So the Trump Administration may find itself out of step both with the science -- and the public.
__label__world (CNN) The archbishop who accused Pope Francis of mishandling sexual misconduct allegations against a top American archbishop unveiled a new charge on Saturday: that Vatican officials -- and perhaps the Pope himself -- have told untruths about the pontiff's controversial meeting in 2015 with Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who refused to sign same-sex marriage certificates.

In a letter published Saturday on LifeSiteNews.com , a conservative Catholic website, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, said that several high-ranking church officials, including the Pope, knew in advance of the meeting and the controversy that could ensue if it became public.

During the Pope's 2015 trip to the United States, he tried, for the most part, to avoid stepping directly into the country's bitter culture wars. Davis, who cited her Christian faith in refusing to validate same-sex marriages, had become a cause célèbre in those wars, with prominent conservative politicians and religious leaders rallying to her side. Davis said the Pope urged her to "stay strong" during their brief meeting at the Vatican embassy in Washington.

After news of the meeting between Davis and Francis leaked, the Vatican tried to downplay the encounter. "Such brief greetings occur on all papal visits and are due to the Pope's characteristic kindness and availability," former Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said in 2015

The only "real audience" granted by the Pope at the Washington embassy, Lombardi said, was with a gay man and his partner , whom Francis knew from his time in Argentina.

Privately, Vatican officials told CNN and other news outlets that the meeting with Kim Davis irked Pope Francis, saying that he didn't know the specifics of Davis' situation before the meeting.

Juan Carlos Cruz, a sexual abuse survivor from Chile who met with the Pope in Rome in May, told The New York Times this week that Francis told him, "I did not know who the woman was and he (Vigano) snuck her in to say hello to me -- and of course they made a whole publicity out of it. And I was horrified and I fired that nuncio."

In a text message to CNN on Saturday, Cruz confirmed his account of the Pope's words. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke has not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment.

"One of them is lying: either Cruz or the Pope?" Vigano wrote on Saturday. "What is certain is that the Pope knew very well who Davis was, and he and his close collaborators had approved the private audience."

Vigano, who served as Vatican ambassador from 2011-2016, has himself emerged as a controversial figure, especially since accusing the Pope and other Vatican officials of weaving a "conspiracy of silence" in a public letter published last Sunday.

In the letter, Vigano called on Pope Francis to resign, saying he was part of a "cover-up" involving former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, whom the Pope forced to resign last month after accusations of sexual misconduct with seminarians and allegations that he abused a minor in the 1970s.

McCarrick has not commented on the accusations involving seminarians and has said he is innocent of the charge that he abused a minor.

Now 89, McCarrick retired as archbishop of Washington in 2006. Vigano alleges that former Pope Benedict XVI knew of the accusations against McCarrick and had placed restrictions on him in 2009 or 2010.

Vigano also said he told Francis that there is "thick" dossier about the accusations in McCarrick's files at the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops, but Francis did nothing about it.

Since Vigano's "testimony," photographic and video evidence has surfaced showing McCarrick preaching and appearing at church events, even one in which Vigano himself praised McCarrick, when the restrictions were supposed to be in place.

Other Catholics have argued that Vigano's accusations should be viewed skeptically because he disagrees with Pope Francis on important church matters and may be bitter over the way he stepped down in 2016.

Vigano's accusations have divided the US Catholic bishops, with some vouching for Vigano's character and calling for an investigation into the charges and others, such as Cardinal James Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, saying they are based on "factual errors, innuendo and fearful ideology."

Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, has called for a church investigation into "the many questions surrounding McCarrick," including Vigano's allegations.

"The questions raised deserve answers that are conclusive and based on evidence. Without those answers, innocent men may be tainted by false accusation and the guilty may be left to repeat sins of the past," DiNardo said

The Vatican has not responded to requests for comments about Vigano's accusations.

"I will not say a single word about this," the Pope told reporters asking for his response to Vigano's charges last Sunday. "I believe the statement speaks for itself. And you have the sufficient journalistic ability to make your conclusions. It's an act of trust."

In his letter on Saturday, Vigano acknowledges that he set up the meeting between the Pope and Davis, saying he gave Francis a one-page memo about the Kentucky clerk's case one day before their encounter on September 24, 2015.

Vigano also said he consulted with two high-ranking officials in the Holy See's Secretariat of State -- Archbishop Paul Gallagher and Archbishop Angelo Becciu -- before the meeting and gained their approval.

Gallagher has not immediately responded to CNN's request for comment. Becciu could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday.

The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a confidant of Pope Francis, tweeted on Saturday that "Francis didn't know who Kim Davis *really* was. I guarantee you. ...The Viganò story looks detailed but it doesn't make sense at all."

Francis didn't know who Kim Davis *really* was. I guarantee you. The only official meeting he had was with his former student Yayo (and his partner and relatives). The Viganò story looks detailed but it doesn't make sense at all. — Antonio Spadaro (@antoniospadaro) September 1, 2018

Amid the furor that followed the meeting between Davis and the Pope, Vigano said he was called to Rome, where Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, told him to expect a papal tongue-lashing.

But when he talked to the Pope, Vigano said, Davis was not mentioned. In fact, Vigano says, the Pope praised him for the success of his visit to the United States.
__label__world (CNN) Here's a look at the 2006 terrorist plot to blow up US-bound flights that originated in the United Kingdom.

Facts:

It is believed that the terrorists were planning to carry peroxide-based explosives in liquid or gel/lotion form in carry-on luggage. The explosives would be hidden in common items such as toothpaste or shampoo bottles. Separately, the explosives triggers would be hidden in an iPod or cell phone. Once on board, the plotters would combine the two and detonate a bomb.

The attacks were to be simultaneous suicide bombings aboard planes flying over the Atlantic, giving the pilots no place to land.

A US official said the plot targeted as many as 10 flights including Continental, United, British Airways, and American Airlines flights to New York, Washington, and California.

Timeline:

August 10, 2006 - British police announce the arrests of 24 people in the UK who allegedly were planning to blow up US-bound airliners. The plan was to smuggle liquid explosives on to as many as 10 jetliners bound for airports in New York, Washington, and California.

__label__world The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane and storm surge warnings for South Florida. The warning extends from Jupiter Inlet on the east coast of the state, southward around the Florida Peninsula to Bonita Beach on the west coast. The warning included the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee, and Florida Bay. The same area had previously been under a hurricane watch.

[Story last published 10:51 p.m. ET]

Conditions in the Turks and Caicos deteriorated Thursday as deadly and massive Hurricane Irma moved in on the islands -- and continued tracking toward South Florida where it could slam Miami this weekend.

"It has become more likely that Irma will make landfall in southern Florida as a dangerous major hurricane, and bring life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts to much of the state," the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.

The hurricane center forecast moved the most likely path of the eye of the storm to the west in its 5 p.m. ET advisory.

"It looks like it's shifting, even though it may be just 20 miles, it puts Miami right in the worst possible position," CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said.

"Because when you look at the formidable storm, the strongest winds, the strongest storm surge, the bands of heavy rain are always in that north, northeastern quadrant."

But Sater cautioned that some models show the storm farther west and some farther east. It is still more than 600 miles from Florida.

Irma, a Category 5 storm churning in the Atlantic with 175 mph sustained winds, killed at least 10 people on Wednesday as it devastated small northeastern Caribbean islands such as Barbuda and left hundreds of thousands of customers in Puerto Rico without power.

"Regardless of which (Florida) coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Thursday at a news conference, with forecasters warning the storm could reach South Florida by Sunday.

Mandatory evacuations have been issued for many counties in South Florida, but Scott said others in Florida need to watch Irma's path and be ready to move.

"This is not a storm you can sit and wait through," he said. He added later: "You don't have to drive hundreds of miles or leave the state to be safe. Go to shelters."

Georgia, too, is ordering coastal evacuations. People in the Savannah area and everywhere along the coast east of Interstate 95 -- including Brunswick and St. Simons Island -- are ordered to leave, starting Saturday, Gov. Nathan Deal said

Irma still was battering the mountainous, northern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday afternoon. It could dump up to 15 inches of rain there -- an amount that could trigger dangerous flooding and mudslides, the US National Hurricane Center said.

Meanwhile, the northeastern Caribbean islands just hit by Irma are anxiously watching Hurricane Jose to the east. On Thursday, Antigua and Barbuda issued a hurricane watch for Jose , which could pass close to those islands Saturday. Prime Minister Gaston Browne said the government has called for voluntary evacuations from Barbuda.

Irma left at least 10 people dead Wednesday, including four on St. Martin, four in the US Virgin Islands, one on Anguilla, and one on Barbuda, officials said. The latter is barely habitable, with nearly all its buildings damaged, Browne said.

Jose became the third major hurricane of the Atlantic basin season on Thursday, with winds of 120 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Category 3 storm is about 625 miles east-southeast of Antigua.

Here are the latest developments

-- Around 8 p.m. ET, Irma's center was about 55 miles west-southwest of Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. Hurricane-force winds could be felt as far as 70 miles from the center. Irma previously had winds over 180 mph, keeping those speeds longer than any storm ever recorded in the Atlantic basin.

-- Irma could cross the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday evening and be near the central Bahamas on Friday.

-- Hurricane warnings are in effect for parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern, central and northwestern Bahamas.

-- A hurricane watch has been issued for Jupiter Inlet on Florida's east coast to Bonita Beach on the west coast. It includes the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.

-- Gov. Scott said Thursday he has directed Florida law enforcement to escort gas trucks to gas stations in an attempt to address reported fuel shortages. "We know fuel is very important" as people prepare to evacuate inland, he said. "While we're making progress, you will see lines and outages, unfortunately."

Southeastern US bracing for storm's arrival

Some computer models show Irma nearing Florida's southern and east coasts by Sunday, and potentially threatening Georgia and South Carolina later. Florida officials are ordering some evacuations and shutting down schools.

Many Floridians spent Thursday stocking up on food or making plans to head inland. Video from CNN affiliate WSVN showed Miami International Airport crowded with people waiting to leave the area.

Miami resident Ashley Hahn was at a beach Thursday with her 4-year-old daughter, saying they were taking a final few dips before fleeing the storm.

"It is chaotic with the lines and gasoline and waiting for water -- you kind of need a break," she said.

"We are probably going to head north, just to be safe. I went through (1992's Hurricane) Andrew as a child, and ... I have seen videos of destruction and everything that it entails. I don't want (my daughter) to be around for that."

Monroe County administrator Roman Gastesi stressed to residents in the Keys they need to heed the evacuation order and leave.

"You might as well leave now, while you have a chance, because when you dial 911, you will not get an answer," he said.

Florida is not the only state preparing for possible impact.

Georgia's Gov. Deal declared a state of emergency for 30 counties. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also declared states of emergency.

Turks and Caicos, Bahamas in Irma's path

Irma was bringing heavy rain and powerful winds to the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday. Residents were told to stay put.

"It's hunker down. Stay where you are. Because you can't go out, because the winds are just far, far too strong," Gov. John Freeman told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360˚."

The governor said the hospital on Grand Turk Island was among 15 buildings that had roof damage or loss.

Storm surges could reach up to 20 feet, the National Hurricane Center says -- twice as high as some of the islands' elevations.

"Some of these Turks and Caicos (Islands) will be completely overwashed," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.

The Turks and Caicos are a British overseas territory with about 35,000 people. Officials there are "working intensively on disaster preparedness and response ... (and) liaising with their counterparts in the Cayman Islands for assistance," UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Alan Duncan said Thursday.

The Bahamas, a nation of about 390,000, ordered evacuations for six southern islands -- Mayaguana, Inagua, Crooked Island, Acklins, Long Cay and Ragged Island.

"This is the largest such evacuation in the history of the country," Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.

Capt. Stephen Russell of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency said the concern was over the power of the storm surge and the potential it will have catastrophic results.

Trail of destruction

Irma's eye passed directly over Barbuda on Wednesday, leaving the small island's 1,800 residents largely incommunicado for hours because it knocked over the telecommunications system and cell towers.

About 95% of the buildings in Barbuda, one of two major islands in the nation of Antigua and Barbuda, are damaged, Browne said.

"It looks like (a) garbage disposal," Marlon Carr, a photographer who toured the island with the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, told CNN on Thursday. "There was rubble and roof galvanized all over the island. It looked like some of the houses ... were imploded on."

Witnesses told him of "40-foot containers flying, animals flying" during the storm. Some spoke of taking shelter in bathrooms as their homes were torn apart.

Browne estimated the damage will cost $100 million to rebuild.

In St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, Kelsey Nowakowski posted images to Instagram of the aftermath there.

In Puerto Rico, about 56,680 customers were without water, with the island's northeast hit the hardest, according to Jesus Poupart of the emergency operations center. Emergency officials are still taking in reports to determine the extent of the damage.

In the beachside area of Piñones near San Juan, Irma tore the roof off Cristian López's fried-food restaurant. He said he wouldn't be able to reopen the place for about five days.

"At least we are all alive," he said.

In the northeast city of Fajardo, authorities conducted at least 10 rescues, an emergency dispatcher there told CNN. Of those, five were from flooded homes, two of people trapped in vehicles, and three who were trapped in an elevator, the dispatcher said.

This story has been updated to reflect a change in the death toll. The French government revised its count of the number of deaths attributed to Irma in the French Caribbean from eight to four.

__label__world Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Reverend Esther was on a mission. She wanted to help craft a world where, as her church put it, "only God is God."

Only then would Earth be ready for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, she said on her website.

Esther, whose legal name in South Korea is Shin Ok-ju, predicted there was a great famine and believed she and her followers needed to find a new home.

They set their sights on Fiji, in the Pacific, and quickly began "laying the eternal foundation to raise Fiji to be the center of the world as promised in the Bible."

The church's corporate arm, GR Group, set to work opening businesses across the small Pacific island, in industries ranging from construction to agriculture.

A screengrab from Grace Road Church's homepage.

But the completion of this Christian utopia appears to have been interrupted by scandal.

Shin was arrested along with three of her followers on July 24 on charges of forced confinement and physical assault, South Korean police said. Authorities allege Shin was keeping some of her followers in Fiji against their will. Shin and one of her followers were arrested after flying into Seoul from Vietnam, while the other two were picked up at the church's headquarters, police said.

For now, the most immediate concern for South Korean law enforcement is 400 of the church's followers, some of whom are stranded in Fiji.

South Korean authorities said many of them appeared to have been stripped of their passports upon arrival by senior members of the church.

Some want to return to South Korea and are receiving consular assistance, but authorities are worried they are currently under the watchful eye of Shin's more strident followers, who are called "guardians."

The case has brought into focus the often secretive world of South Korea's quasi-religious groups, and their surprising reach and influence.

The Grace Road Church maintained connections at the highest levels of the Fiji government. Pictures in local media and on the GR Group website show Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama personally appearing beside GR Group's president to give the company an award for its business successes in 2017.

The award website called GR Group "a shining example of what hard work, dedication and ingenuity can translate into a business."

The Prime Minister's office declined to comment about the case in an email to CNN.

In a statement to CNN, GR Group denied wrongdoing and said Shin was arrested under false claims.

"GR Group is a group of Christians who see, hear, believe, and act by the Bible. We listened to the Words of God though our reverend, gathered from all over the world, and moved to Fiji for the God-given vision. We believe that Fiji is the promised land hidden in the Bible, beautiful and pristine land blessed by God," the statement said.

"Those, who wish to slander us, have created unspeakable lies about passport confiscation, forced labor, incarceration, and violence," the statement said.

"Because we are enraged by blasphemy of the name of God and dishonoring our reverend and GR Group, 400 of us want to speak up that all these are not true. All the stories reported in the media are not true and we have evidences to disprove. God shall let the truth be known to the entire world soon."

The church has received negative attention in South Korea's tight-knit Christian circles for its ritualistic practices, including the alleged beatings of its members as a form of exorcism.

The Fijian flag is pictured flying over Suva, Fiji, in 2006.

They also have a reputation for threatening people and organizations who criticize them, according Tark Ji-Il, a professor of religion at Busan Presbyterian University and an expert on religious movements in South Korea.

"For Shin to be arrested for forced confinement and physical assaults shows that her church was not working as a 'normal' church but had characteristics of a pseudo-religion exploiting the followers," Tark told CNN.

Shin's lawyer, Kim Dae-yeol, told CNN the reports on Shin and her church so far seem "seriously distorted" compared to his findings. When asked follow up questions, Kim said that he could not comment any further as he just took this case only a couple of days ago and is still gathering information.

Religious extremism

Grace Road Church made headlines in New York in 2014, when Shin was sued for $6 million by a schizophrenic man who previously belonged to the church.

The suit alleges that Shin supervised as he was strapped down for a 10-day period as part of a healing treatment for his psychosis. The restraints severely cut off blood flow to his legs, according to the suit, one of which developed gangrene and eventually required amputation. The case is ongoing.

A law firm listed as representing Shin told CNN they no longer do so and could not comment on the case. It's not clear who is currently providing representation.

Fringe religious movements are surprisingly common in South Korea. Perhaps the most famous case involved the country's last president, Park Geun-hye, who was taken down by a scandal with religious connections.

Park was impeached on allegations she shared classified information with her longtime confidant, Choi Soon-sil. Choi has often been described as a Rasputin-like character.

Choi's father, Choi Tae-min, founded the Eternal Life Church, declared himself a modern-day Buddha and called for all people to strive for eternal life. The younger Choi took over after her father died in 1994 at age 82 and then became a spiritual mentor to Park.

But many smaller cases get little attention, as many people are afraid to speak ill of questionable religious organizations due to fear of possible defamation lawsuits. One academic expert declined to speak to CNN because of a string of lawsuits brought by religious groups against him.

A big business

Unlike other South Korean religious organizations, many of which are resolutely inward facing, the Grace Road Church had pursued a model of development more commonly associated with a multinational business conglomerate.

The GR Group opened up shop in Fiji in 2014 first investing in agricultural industries, according to its unverified Facebook page. The company has since grown in scope, opening shops and obtaining interests in various industries on the island -- everything from construction to retail stores. These are important investments to a country with one of the world's smallest GDPs that is trying to attract more foreign investors.

The GR Group says it is composed of 150 investors and their families who have traveled to Fiji, according to the company's statement to the Fiji Sun.

A screengrab from Grace Road Group's website.

It's opened several restaurants and the company bills itself as "Fiji's leading restaurant operator."

The group also invested $5 million to Fiji National University to promote organic farming, according to the school's website.

But it's unclear how the church's parishioners fit into the business side of things or if they're employed by GR Group's various companies across the island nation.

In a statement supplied to the Fiji Sun , the GR Group said it was a good corporate citizen, employing some 220 local Fijians.

South Korean authorities said they have asked Interpol, the international police agency, for assistance in securing the safety of its citizens in Fiji.

In the wake of the allegations, Fiji Police have opened a preliminary investigation into GR Group, according to local media.

But the country's attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, said the arrest of Shin would not impact GR Group's business interests.

"We have not had any repercussions on any of the projects they are currently undertaking as the same way as the shops are all running, patisseries and food outlets are all running," Sayed-Khaiyum said, according to The Fiji Times

Neither Sayed-Khaiyum's office nor Fiji Police responded to CNN's request for comment about the South Korean members of the Grace Road Church.
__label__world Berlin (CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned violent anti-migrant protests in the state of Saxony, saying "hate in the streets" has no place in the country.

German police fired water cannons and used pepper spray in the city of Chemnitz on Monday night during a second day of protests, as 6,000 far-right demonstrators, some chanting neo-Nazi slogans and giving Hitler salutes, clashed with counter-protesters over the fatal stabbing of a 35-year-old German man in a brawl.

German media accused police of being unprepared for Monday's protests.

Two men -- an Iraqi and a Syrian -- have been arrested in connection with the stabbing.

"What we have seen is something which has no place in a constitutional democracy," Merkel said Tuesday in Berlin, during a joint news conference alongside Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic.

__label__world The ‘Godfather of Coral’ predicts a ‘planetary catastrophe’ Rebecca Wright and Ivan Watson , CNN Video by Tom Booth and Stuart Ireland for CNN

Townsville, Australia — In a dusty, secluded corner of the Australian state of Queensland, a septuagenarian scientist is on an urgent mission to raise the alarm about the future of the planet.

John "Charlie" Veron -- widely known as "The Godfather of Coral" -- is a renowned reef expert who has personally discovered nearly a quarter of the world's coral species and has spent the past 45 years diving Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

But after a lifetime trying to make sense of the vast ecosystems that lie beneath the ocean's surface, the 73-year-old is now becoming a prophet of their extinction.

More on the Great Barrier Reef

"It's the beginning of a planetary catastrophe," he tells CNN. "I was too slow to become vocal about it."

John ‘Charlie’ Veron Rebecca Wright/CNN

In 2016 and 2017, marine heat waves caused by climate change resulted in mass bleaching, which killed about half of the corals on the Great Barrier Reef, along with many others around the world.

"Somewhere between a quarter and a third of all marine species everywhere has some part of their life cycle in coral reefs," he says. "So, you take out coral reefs and a third to a quarter of all marine species gets wiped out. Now that is ecological chaos, it is ecological collapse."

Watch the full documentary: Race to save the reef

One of the natural wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef is 2,300km long -- roughly the length of Italy -- and is the only living organism that can be seen from space.

When Veron, a former Chief Scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, first went diving on the vast reef in the early 1960s he felt like "his life started."

"It was so much packed into a small area, so much life, so much activity, even noisy. It was really a metropolis, it was really humming and buzzing," he says. "It's a wilderness, it's dangerous, it's exciting."

At that stage, he had no idea about what was in store for this vibrant underwater habitat.

"I was a climate change skeptic, at first," he says. He realized that climate change was "serious" in the mid-1980s, and around 1990 he became "alarmed" about its impact on coral reefs.

The Great Barrier Reef is home to more than 1,500 fish species.

Coral reefs 'on death row'

Veron says the mass bleaching events in the past few years -- and the prospect of losing one of nature's greatest treasures -- were a wake-up call for the world in the wider battle against climate change.

"It's more than an alarm bell," says Veron. "It's an air raid siren."

But the die-off came as no surprise to him. Back in the 1990s, he had predicted that climate change would destroy the reef, documented in several books he published, and in a 2009 keynote lecture titled "Is the Great Barrier Reef on Death Row?" at the Royal Society in London, where he was introduced by veteran British naturalist Sir David Attenborough.

Attenborough described Veron as "one of the great authorities in the world on coral" who has "devoted himself to looking after and raising awareness about the dangers facing the reef."

Watch: The race to save the Great Barrier Reef

Among the Australian conservation community, Veron's reputation is also unmatched.

"Charlie is a legendary figure in coral reef circles. There's no-one else in the world who has seen what Charlie has seen," says Richard Leck, the Head of Oceans at WWF Australia. "He comes with a level of experience and gravitas that few other people and organizations could match and that's where his enormous influence comes from."

After the recent mass bleaching events, Veron dived in multiple areas of the Great Barrier Reef to see the damage for himself.

"I was seeing it and feeling it and it was absolutely horrific, there's no other way to describe it," he says.

Veron took CNN underwater for a first-hand look. There are still large sections of healthy, thriving parts of reef that are teeming with life. But there are also vast areas of coral graveyards that look like they suffered an underwater forest fire.

In the summer of 2018, experts say no bleaching occurred, which has helped some of the bleached coral to begin the recovery process. But Veron says it takes about 10 years for corals to recover fully, and they simply don't have that sort of time.

"For most years, say five out of seven years, there will be now mass bleaching on coral reefs around the world," he says.

Veron says he hates to predict the future for the Great Barrier Reef, because it "can't be anything other than absolute massive death."

His certainty is partly due to the fact that the oceans are only now seeing the impact of carbon emissions from the late 1990s, so Veron says even if we stop burning fossil fuels now, the oceans will continue warming for at least two more decades.

A life underwater

Born John Veron, his teachers at school gave him the nickname "Charlie" after Charles Darwin, due to his obsessive curiosity with the natural world, as detailed in his 2017 memoir, "A Life Underwater."

He has had a storied career in academia and research, becoming the first scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and later its Chief Scientist. But he eventually left as, he says, he struggled with the bureaucracy of working for the government agency.

"Charlie is a maverick, he is certainly outspoken and is certainly passionate," Leck says. "Charlie has risked his reputation, probably his livelihood, and people who don't want the status quo to change get upset about that."

Now, Veron spends his days mostly working from his rural home “Rivendell' -- named after the refuge of the elves in the J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" -- near Townsville in Queensland.

The sprawling concrete structure, which Veron helped to build more than 40 years ago, is immersed in nature. Wandering outside the house he points out multiple wallabies. His pets include dozens of fish, two dogs and a few geese.

He lives with his second wife, 60-year-old British coral biologist Mary Stafford-Smith, who has co-authored and edited many of his books. Together, they are documenting and categorizing the world’s corals on their website, Corals of the World.

Veron has three adult children: one daughter from his first marriage, and a son and daughter with Stafford-Smith. His face clouds over as he talks about the heartbreak of losing another daughter, Noni -- short for Fiona -- who drowned in a creek as a 10-year-old.

He again turns gloomy when he talks about the family's plan to leave their beloved Rivendell, to move further north to an area which is higher and wetter, where they could one day live off the land. He says he wants to secure his family's future for a world that he believes will be ruined by climate change.

"We have to have a refuge for our children when everything goes belly up," he says. "We've got no choice."

'Mass extinction event'

This doomsday scenario seems extreme, but after decades of studying scientific evidence around this topic, Veron believes that this eventuality is a certainty.

"We have got now also the phenomenon of a mass extinction event looming," he says, which he describes as a "man-made asteroid" that would compare to the dinosaurs being wiped out.

The biggest driver of increased carbon emissions in the atmosphere is burning coal, he says, and that's something he thinks Australia is not doing enough to stop.

"It's very political, because no country is as addicted to coal as Australia is," he says. "We're making a fortune out of coal."

Australia was the world's largest exporter of coal in 2017 and although the country is signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change, this week the Australian government withdrew its National Energy Guarantee (NEG) legislation -- which included targets for lowering carbon emissions -- saying there was a lack of support for the bill.

Race to save the reef

Earlier this year, the Australian government announced nearly $400m in new funding towards scientific projects designed to help the Great Barrier Reef.

Corals are colonies of small animals called coral polyps.

There has been criticism in Australia about the tender process for the funding, as the money was given directly to a small charity -- the Great Barrier Reef Foundation -- which will administer the funds to different projects. The government insists it met the relevant guidelines, and says it welcomes an audit into the process.

Critics also say that the money should have been spent on tackling climate change.

"Coral bleaching is driven by carbon dioxide -- unless you stop pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it'll go on. It's as simple as that," Veron says.

The funding won't be wasted, though, Veron says, as scientists will be able to create a sort of seed bank for corals, to preserve the species until the climate is stable enough to rebuild the reefs.

The reef is a center of spectacular biodiversity.

"What the scientists hope to do is to help nature along a bit if they can, and that is to do all we can to repopulate, help the corals, after the big carbon dioxide increase is over and it starts to come down," he says.

For all his dire predictions for the future of the planet, he thinks humans were destined to take this path.

"It's part of being human to not worry about the long-term future," he says. "We're genetically programmed like that ... we just don't think ahead."
__label__world (CNN) When Lee Haw-sook's son was growing up, she knew there was a risk he'd end up in prison .

Lee is one of around 100,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in South Korea. While the Christian denomination are a tiny minority in the country, they make up the majority of the thousands who have been jailed for refusing to serve in the military

"I looked at the older children who were going (to prison), and realized that my child would too," Lee told CNN.

Though she raised her son, Gyo-won, in the faith, Lee said she never pressure him to become an objector and encouraged him to make up his own mind on it.

"I'm proud of my son that he chose to follow his faith out of his own free will," she said. "I'm grateful towards him that he followed my faith."

Now 22, Gyo-won is serving an 18-month sentence.

South Korea -- still technically at war with its northern neighbor -- imprisons more conscientious objectors than any other country, but Jehovah's Witnesses and other objectors are optimistic this will soon change.

In June, the Constitutional Court ruled the government must provide alternative civilian roles for those who decline to take up arms, and on Thursday the Supreme Court of South Korea began hearings into the matter for the first time in 14 years, with 900 cases before lower courts currently on hold. A ruling is expected towards the end of the year.

"I hope that I will be among the last ones to experience prison life, a prison life that was given to me due to my love of others and, most importantly, my love of God and his principles," Lee Gyo-won said last week from the Daegu Detention Center, in the country's south.

South Korean activists and conscientious objectors to military service hold yellow banners reading "Conscientious objection is not a crime" during a rally outside the Constitutional Court in Seoul on June 28, 2018.

Professional repercussions

Under current South Korean law, all men between the ages of 18 and 35 are required to perform at least 21 months of military service. The Defense Ministry has pledged to reduce the term to 18 months by 2020.

The law has derailed the careers of many of the country's biggest sports stars and K-Pop artists, with hugely popular boy band Big Bang having to go on hiatus recently so its members can perform their military service.

On Saturday, South Korea's national men's football team -- including Premier League star Son Heung-min -- are one game away from avoiding military service and a potentially fatal pause in their professional careers, if they beat Japan in the final of the Asian Games.

For those who choose prison over the military, their professional lives can be completely devastated, according to Amnesty International, which said in a briefing to the Supreme Court that "many conscientious objectors face economic and social disadvantages which last far beyond their typical 18 month jail term."

From early adulthood, Lee Gyo-won prepared for jail, choosing not to go to university but instead to become a contractor, specializing in interior construction, so he could be self-employed after his release from prison. When the day of his conscription came, he arranged with police to hand himself over.

"He didn't want the officers to show up at his house to put cuffs on him," Lee's mother said. "My family went with him that day and officers met him outside the prison and took him in."

While the Constitutional Court found the current law unconstitutional and ordered the government to legislative to provide alternative forms of service by the end of 2019, it did not expunge the criminal records of those already sentenced, or do anything for the more than 200 conscientious objectors currently in prison, including Lee Gyo-won.

"Conscientious objectors must never be treated as criminals simply for exercising their human right," said Amnesty International researcher Hiroka Shoji. "The Supreme Court must now act up to finally recognize the right (conscientious objectors) are entitled to."

Many conservative South Koreans still strongly support military conscription however. A bill proposed by Liberty Korea Party lawmakers this month would force objectors to perform 44 months -- double the usual length -- of alternative service, including mine sweeping and other dangerous activities.

"This is a form of retaliatory punishment against conscientious objectors that is anachronistic and in violation of human rights," the left-wing Hankyoreh newspaper said in an editorial last week

Decades-long battle

The longstanding refusal of Jehovah's Witnesses to serve in the military has often brought believers into conflict with governments.

Witnesses' conscientious objection is based on a belief "that Christians should abstain from war because they have no right to take human life," informed by pacifist Bible passages and the example of early Christian communities.

Some 4,000 Witnesses were jailed by the US during World War II, and hundreds of German practitioners were executed by the Nazi regime for refusing to serve in the military, according to the group

"Korean Witnesses, though, have the distinction of enduring the longest-running prohibition of their stand of conscience," the group said in a statement.

While she supported her son's decision to take a stand, Lee could not help worrying about him when he first went to prison.

"He grew up like a flower in a green house, sheltered, in quiet beauty," she said. "My imagination would run wild. But I realized that there is nothing I can do for him so I let it all go."

Lee said she was "proud of my son," but happy that due to the Constitutional Court's decision -- and a potentially further reaching Supreme Court ruling -- his would be the last generation of Witnesses going to prison.

"All his predecessors' sacrifices have contributed to this," she said.
__label__world (CNN) A trio of intense earthquakes shook several islands in the South Pacific and Indonesia on Sunday, including two on the already battered island of Lombok.

The most recent major quake was a 6.9 magnitude tremor centered just 4 kilometers south of Belanting, on the Indonesian island of Lombok.

That island is still trying to recover from the devastating effects of an August 5 earthquake that killed more than 430 people.

No casualties or damage were reported immediately after Sunday's quake near Belanting, and no tsunami warning was issued.

The earthquake came just hours after two other tremors rattled Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.

__label__world (CNN) South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday that US President Donald Trump would be a worthy winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement in the warming of relations with North Korea.

A former South Korean President, Kim Dae-jung, won the prize in 2000 for his role in setting up a previous summit with North Korea, and his widow suggested Monday that Moon should also get the award.

Moon demurred in response, saying the US President ought to get it instead. "President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. The only thing we need is peace," Moon said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday, according to the Blue House, the South Korean presidential office.

His remarks come three days after a historic summit that saw North Korean leader Kim Jong Un cross the border into South Korea for talks with his southern counterpart.

The two leaders spoke about the need for peace between their nations and pledged a "complete denuclearization" of the peninsula.

Kigali, Rwanda -- In the darkness of the Kigali night, Eric walks through a maze of cement homes crowned in corrugated metal. Using his phone he lights the road under his feet, a path of compressed red earth still drying out from the rainy season.

After nearly an hour of walking through a series of dizzying hills that make up the Rwandan capital, he reaches his safe house. Eric -- whose name has been changed for his safety -- says he's being watched by the government.

Staying more than one night is too risky. Tomorrow he'll move again.

"Eric" and another Rwigara supporter at their safehouse in Kigali.

Inside a two-room house, illuminated by a single light affixed to a cement wall, he starts his story. It begins with one name: Diane.

Diane Rwigara is a former presidential hopeful and women's rights activist who is currently in prison outside central Kigali awaiting trial.

The 37-year-old accountant, a fierce critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame, launched her election bid three months ahead of the August 2017 vote. She was Kagame's sole female challenger in the poll.

But her campaign was short-lived. Electoral authorities disqualified her, claiming she doctored the number of signatures needed to qualify and accusing her of submitting the names of dead people, which she denied.

With her presidential bid over, Rwigara launched the People Salvation Movement (Itabaza), an activist group to "encourage Rwandans to hold their government accountable." Shortly after its inception, she was arrested on charges of incitement and fraud, which her family and supporters say are politically motivated.

Diane Rwigara, far left, is seen in a family portrait at the Rwigara home in Kigali.

Rwigara's supporters like Eric, who fear for their lives, say a state-sanctioned atmosphere of harassment, censorship and threat of violence make it nearly impossible to speak out against the government.

After Rwigara's August arrest, Eric was detained overnight with around 10 other supporters. Speaking to CNN in a Kigali safe house, he molds his hand into the shape of a gun and places two fingers inside his mouth. This, he says, is how he was told by police to stop supporting her.

Another Rwigara supporter who was with Eric at the time says he watched an officer threaten him with a gun, adding that he was beaten by another group of police also on the scene.

Rwanda is often described as the best place in the world for women in politics, with more female lawmakers in parliament than any other country, but it's not the case if you challenge President Kagame, Eric says.

Last year, Kagame won the presidential election Rwigara had hoped to contest with almost 99% of the vote.

The 60-year-old -- who in 2015 cleared the way to potentially stay in power until 2034 -- has been president since 2000, but has long been an instrumental leader in the country's modern history.

Kigali's expanding skyline. Rwanda has become more financially prosperous and stable under Kagame's leadership, but endemic poverty remains an issue nationwide, with around 51% of the population living under the international poverty line.

In 1994, Kagame led the armed wing of the Rwandan Patriotic Front or RPF (what is now the ruling party) into Kigali. That act helped to bring an end to a genocide that saw an estimated 800,000 people killed -- mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group -- in just 100 days. Two million people also fled the country.

Since then, Kagame has been widely credited with the nation's remarkable turnaround. His fiscal and social policies are widely touted by supporters -- and many in the international community -- as a blueprint for success in the region.

Part of that success has been measured by his commitment to gender parity. A post-genocide population skewed Rwanda's female population to 70%. Kagame placed value on women's roles and spearheaded many reforms to help build women's capacity in civil society.

The most notable is a constitutional law that requires at least 30% of all parliamentary seats to be occupied by women. Today, Rwanda far surpasses that quota, with 61.3% of its parliament made up of female lawmakers (compared with the global average at 23.8%). Four out of seven Supreme Court justices are women, and the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion ensures gender representation and equality in local politics across the country.

Women make their way to a morning market in Kigali.

Female lawmakers have been praised for supporting policy changes around domestic violence, land rights and inheritance. But Rwigara's supporters say this is a veneer masking a lack of real opposition and freedoms.

In a modern, luxurious Kigali villa only miles away from Eric's hideout, Rwigara's sister Anne and brother Arioste explain more.

Diane Rwigara lived much of her life outside Rwanda, traveling between California and Kigali. A family photo hanging on the wall of the living room shows a young, smiling Rwigara holding onto the shoulders of her father. She, like her father Assinapol Rwigara -- a successful businessman -- were at one time strong Kagame supporters.

"Blinded by how clean the streets are, how beautiful the city is... she thought it was the miracle country that had been talked about," Anne says.

"But when she got on site it was a different story."

In 2015, Rwigara returned to Rwanda from California after her father died in a car crash in suspicious circumstances. The official police report said that a truck driver had crashed into Assinapol's car, which resulted in his death. But the Rwigaras allege that members of Kagame's party harassed Assinapol -- who was an important financier of the RPF in the early 1990s -- after he refused to allow the government to seize control of his business and that he was killed on the president's orders.

The Rwigaras wrote to Kagame calling the crash an assassination and asking for a full and transparent inquiry.

"They will come in and take over what you worked for your whole life," Anne says.

"Next thing you know you won't have that business, you will be working for them... at best... they will kick you out of the business."

Rwanda's National Police, the Office of the President and the RPF have not responded to CNN's request for comment.

Anne Rwigara looks outside, beyond the metal gates that guard the house.

There, two stationary cars, sit for hours at a time watching the residence. Anne and Arioste say they are government surveillance vehicles.

The 2018 World Bank Doing Business Report named Rwanda the second-best place to do business in sub-Saharan Africa and it's ranked among the least corrupt countries on the continent, according to Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index.

But when Rwigara sought to learn more about her father's death, her family says she found a very different picture. This was the "catalyst" for Diane's political awakening, her siblings say.

She questioned what she saw as suspicious deaths and disappearances of prominent businessmen, lawyers, journalists and a former intelligence official, among others, Anne says. Groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International previously have highlighted those cases.

Rwanda's National Police and the Office of the President have not responded to CNN's request for comment on those cases.

A photo of Assinapol Rwigara, who died in 2015, is displayed at the Rwigara home.

In the lead-up to her presidential bid, Rwigara traveled outside Kigali, where most Rwandans live below the poverty line. She garnered support from many young people in rural areas and worked with volunteers like Eric to gather enough signatures to run for president.

Her press conferences and meetings were well attended by young people and journalists alike. That support was a surprising concern to some ruling party leaders, say her family and a local journalist who attended the meetings.

"There was a lot of fear surrounding what she was exposing about the country," Anne says. Young people who attended her meetings would "see themselves in her," she adds.

"Diane would talk about things they'd (the ruling party) been trying to hide away from public eye: famine, persecution, etc. She could sense their pain and they wanted to support her. They were really behind her... a lot of people thought: 'enough was enough' at this point, what do we have to lose?'"

Diane Rwigara knew her political aspirations would amount to "suicide," Anne says, referring to a political climate marred by violence and jail terms. But she was willing to risk it. When Diane told her family she was planning to run for president, they were against it. They were concerned for her safety and her future.

Diane, they say, responded: "Is this a life? Do you even think you are living?"

Her brother Arioste Rwigara says that "in Rwanda, speaking of any injustice like that is a crime -- it's a sin," adding that Rwandans have accepted a status quo of censorship because they are afraid to voice their opinions.

Anne Rwigara: "We don't hide... you just reach a point and stand still and face what comes your way. They use a lot of pressure and fear to just silence people. You get to a point you realize you can't take it, you can't keep running and hiding. You feel better, when you are speaking the truth."

Arioste, like many of Kagame's critics, believes the president uses the context of the genocide to quash any dissent, using Rwanda's "Law relating to the punishment of the Crime of Genocide Ideology" -- which is designed to prohibit hate speech -- as a muzzle for any oppositional voices.

"I think the genocide is used as a pretext, as a justification for everything they do," he says.

The Office of the President has not responded to CNN's request for comment.

It came as no surprise to her family when shortly after Rwigara announced her candidacy, nude photos, allegedly of her, were spread across the internet. Rwigara and her family say the images were part of a smear campaign.

"They are fake nudes, altered in Photoshop, and it is one of many tactics that has been used to silence me," Diane Rwigara told CNN in an August 2017 interview. A spokesman for Kagame's party at the time denied to CNN having anything to do with the photos.

After Rwigara was disqualified, Rwanda's Revenue Authority slapped her family's business with a tax bill of 5.7 billion Rwandan francs (approximately $6.5 million) according to Anne, the company's representative.

"He really likes to send a message. He likes to remind people, warning them, don't even think about it," Anne says of Kagame.

The Office of the President and the National Public Prosecution Authority have not responded to CNN's request for comment.

Anne was initially arrested along with Diane and their mother Adeline on tax evasion charges and charged with incitement against the government. The tax evasion charges were eventually dropped, but only Anne was released and freed of all charges. Adeline now faces charges of discrimination and sectarian practices and inciting insurrection, based on WhatsApp messages exchanged between her and her sister, who lives outside Rwanda. The prosecution has called those private chats -- in which Adeline and her sisters criticized the government -- "dangerous meetings." Diane has been charged with forgery and inciting insurrection.

The family say police bashed in this door and damaged other parts of their property when Diane, Anne and Adeline Rwigara were arrested.

While Rwigara and her mother await trial, the government has seized the family's business, selling off their assets for more than 1.7 billion Rwandan francs (approximately $1.9 million) in auctions in March and June 2018, according to Anne Rwigara, the company's representative.

With their cash flow now squeezed, a trial that has been pushed back three times and concerns over legal fees, the siblings are more worried than ever. They believe that the likelihood of the Rwigaras' release -- and a chance for a woman from the opposition to run for president of Rwanda -- are slim.

Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes says that "criticizing the government is not a crime," and has called on the Rwandan judiciary to "ensure that this trial does not become just another means to persecute government critics."

For now, Diane and her mother, Adeline, are in separate cells at the newly constructed Mageragere Prison, a 30-minute drive from central Kigali. There, they spend most of their days alone, with short, highly supervised visits allowed once a week, according to the Rwigara family and other supporters who have visited them.

Attempts by CNN to speak with Diane Rwigara have been unsuccessful.

Most of Rwigara's supporters have stopped visiting the pair in prison, fearful of retribution. One supporter says he stopped visiting her after his phone and laptop were confiscated by authorities who, he says, beat him and told him: "I will kill you if you continue to do this."

In June he fled Rwanda, fearful to return to imprisonment, or lethal violence, he says. Some of Rwigara's supporters have gone missing and he worries they could have been killed.

It is not clear how the trial, postponed until September 24, will unfold.

Although Rwigara was seeking to run as an independent candidate and was not connected with a political party, her story is similar to other opposition politicians.

Seven years before Rwigara attempted to stand against Kagame, lawyer and leader of the opposition FDU-Inkingi party Victoire Ingabire returned from the Netherlands, where she had been living in exile, to contest the 2010 election.

Ingabire, a Hutu, was arrested shortly afterward on charges that included collaborating with a terrorist organization and "genocide ideology." She was initially handed an eight-year prison sentence that was later extended to 15 years. Kagame went on to win that election with 93% of the vote. Ingabire, now 49, is still in prison.

A former FDU-Inkingi treasurer who lives in exile and asked to remain anonymous because of safety fears says "anyone who will come out and try to say something different will end up in a prison or dead."

"This is the reality of Rwanda," the former treasurer says.

But many female lawmakers from Kagame's ruling coalition, including Senate Vice President Jeanne d'Arc Gakuba, do not agree.

Gakuba believes the Rwandan political model is inclusive to all women, saying that it "absolutely" accommodates for female candidates from all backgrounds, including those with dissenting voices. She points to her own beginnings as a city councilor when she says she was supported in her bid to enter politics.

Margaret Nyagahura, a senator in the Rwandan parliament who was personally appointed by Kagame, agrees.

"It definitely has nothing to do with her being a woman or vying for the position of President," Nyagahora says of Rwigara's case.

Gakuba and Nyagahura, like many others, do not even want to speak about Rwigara or her case. Some female lawmakers scoff at the suggestion that the Kagame challenger was a legitimate candidate to begin with, using "that woman," or "the young girl," dismissively.

Kagame himself has made his thoughts on Rwigara known.

Shortly after he was re-elected, he spoke to an incoming group of ministers, many of them female. He referenced Rwigara.

"Even if you have been or want to become president of the country, you are not immune from prosecution. Those who are listening better be hearing me," he said.

In June, Anne and other members of the Rwigara family appealed to Kagame for Diane and her mother Adeline's release. They say both are in imminent danger in jail. But they believe their plea won't be heard.

Many of Rwigara's supporters fear the same. Eric remains on the run, swapping political activism for protecting his personal safety.

"If you want to go to prison, you can speak the truth," he says.

Others have fled the country, convinced that returning would eventually lead to a death sentence.

"She wanted everyone to feel free," one supporter, now in exile, said.

"When she went to prison, we lost something."

__label__world (CNN) It is both what we knew had to happen one day and something no one ever expected to happen.

The key plank of both US and Afghan policy for ending the longest war in American history is that the Taliban must enter into a political process.

But this was often couched with the Taliban's renunciation of violence and distancing from al Qaeda, or a military win for the Afghan-US coalition that would put these allies in a position of strength ahead of negotiations.

Yet on Wednesday, Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani swept away over a decade of caveats and said that with no preconditions, the Taliban could be a recognized political party with an office in Kabul . This would be the first time they've had a post in the capital since they ran it in 2001.

Much can change or be rejected, and the demand that women be involved throughout the process may deter an immediate acceptance from Taliban hardliners.

But this staggering change of heart comes just over 30 days since US President Donald Trump said talks were off the table. "I don't think we're prepared to talk right now," he said on January 28. "It's a whole different fight over there. They're killing people left and right. Innocent people are being killed left and right."

Afghanistan is the only part of US foreign policy this commander in chief has made a specific and detailed policy speech on. He has pledged to win -- but has been sketchy on how.

Yet this statement in January dismayed some US officials who had long accepted the need to encourage talks and not dismiss them out of hand. (Yes, the US proscribes the Taliban as a terrorist group, but peace talks were always meant to be an Afghan-only affair, surmounting that hurdle).

Afghan security officials echoed Trump's sentiment, as it came after a series of ghastly Taliban and ISIS attacks in the heart of the capital

But now, suddenly, we have Ashraf Ghani, in the face of political turmoil in his unity government and demands for elections sooner rather than later, making a stark and unconditional volte face. Why?

The simplest answer is the starkest: desperation. The Taliban are increasing the territory they dominate, according to the latest US figures.

Losses by Afghan security forces had been mounting, yet are now classified under an order from the Afghan government. Bombs regularly hit the most protected parts of Kabul. Neither of these things suggests that the war against the Taliban is going well.

JUST WATCHED The pillars of Trump's Afghanistan strategy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The pillars of Trump's Afghanistan strategy 02:08

This sudden and sweeping offer does not fit with the often-espoused four-year plan from the coalition. This year it is meant to see territory being reclaimed, putting Kabul in a position of strength. And that simply isn't happening at this point.

Yet to dismiss this as foolish and a mere act of desperation would relegate Afghanistan's conflict to the brutal domain of warlords and strongmen.

The broad need to begin peace talks has been present since the Obama administration began focusing on the war in 2009. The conditions for those talks were never met, so they took place in secret. They then ultimately failed, as the Taliban kept winning militarily, and knew the American surge would soon end.

Perhaps President Ghani needs progress -- to be seen as achieving something in a war where loss and death are the main currency. Starting up talks might curry favor with war-exhausted Afghans.

Perhaps he felt the need to dial back on the negativity of January's statements against negotiations. Perhaps he believes the Taliban are more open to a political accommodation than is publicly known.

The Taliban have -- at the time of writing -- yet to answer. They have tired and weary members, but are also deep in competition with ISIS for younger recruits and finance, so may find accepting this open offer does not chime with their objective of trying to reclaim the title of being the most-extreme insurgent group.

It is also unclear that even if the Taliban accept initial talks, ISIS will stop the violence, or that another Taliban atrocity like the recent attack in Kabul won't make negotiating with the enemy politically unpalatable again.

The scope for success -- for getting a decades-old insurgency that is winning militarily to talk itself out of a fight -- is small.

The scope for failure -- for the flat and blunt rejection of this open and generous offer of talk and legitimization, or its slow demise through intransigence and continued violence -- is large.
__label__world Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) The farmer plucks a cannabis flower from a long stalk. He presses it against his nose, inhales deeply and begins to extol the therapeutic -- if not necessarily scientific -- properties of his crop.

"Smell this. It smells like heaven," says Abu Salim, who doesn't want his real name used for security reasons. "This is the herb of happiness. My friend says that when he smokes a joint, his wife becomes a princess, the world shines, and life is beautiful!"

This is part of the heartland of Lebanese farming, once considered the breadbasket of the Middle East. It is also home to some of the region's most conservative and controversial political groups.

An expanse of cannabis -- almost the size of three soccer fields -- stretches out in front of Abu Salim. Harvesting season hasn't started yet, but the country has recently trained its sights on fields like these.

Heeding the recommendation of international consulting group McKinsey, which was part of a broader development plan, Lebanon's parliament is preparing to legalize medicinal cannabis and its cultivation. It's meant to pave the way to a nearly $800 million industry, according to Economy Minister Raed Khoury, and could serve as a quick fix for some of the country's many economic woes.

And Lebanon's farmers say the change can't come too soon. As in many parts of the region, the country's farmlands have been disproportionately affected by global warming. The Bekaa Valley, nestled between Mount Lebanon and Syria, is stricken with droughts, and many wells are drying up. Growing potatoes, onions and other produce native to the region has been harder than ever before, experts and farmers say.

But cannabis is a drought-resistant crop, requiring little water and no pesticides. And it flourishes in the high altitudes of the Bekaa plains.

A farmer in a pickup truck rolls up next to Abu Salim. "What's the latest on the talk about legalizing the potatoes?" the farmer calls out. "Potatoes" is code for hashish, the resin made from the cannabis plants in these parts. "God knows!" says Abu Salim.

"If they don't go ahead with it, there's no hope for us!" the other farmer says, as he goes off on his way. No legal hope, that is.

Later, peering from beneath his bucket hat as he drives his truck over dirt roads -- unofficial streets that criss-cross his sprawling carpets of cannabis -- Abu Salim gesticulates wildly as he talks about how his plant "makes life beautiful." But what he calls the "herb of happiness" does not completely quiet his nerves, and he eyes the surroundings with some suspicion. He even keeps an assault rifle on the floor of his truck.

The Bekaa has a long history of producing hashish. Abu Salim even claims that his grandfather once found an engraving of a cannabis flower amid the ruins of the ancient Phoenician city of Baalbek.

And its reputation extends far beyond Lebanon's borders, with "Lebanon Gold" a staple on the menus of coffee shops in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, was first identified in a sample of smuggled Lebanese hashish in 1964. That discovery helped pave the way to research into the medicinal and therapeutic components of cannabis.

Lebanese officials hope that legalizing the crop will boost exports, helping to jumpstart Lebanon's moribund economy. It has the world's third-highest ratio of debt to gross domestic product and suffers from decaying infrastructure and ballooning unemployment. Lebanese agriculture experts say the move could also breathe life into a languishing agricultural sector buckling under the effects of climate change.

"The people of this Bekaa plain know how to grow (cannabis). They are experts in this," says Mustapha Haidar, a professor of weed sciences at the American University of Beirut and the director of a prominent agricultural research center in the Bekaa. "They are not good in marketing but they are good at growing this plant. And if the government controlled the selling of this and gave licenses for medicinal uses, I think it's great. Why not?"

Economy Minister Raed Khoury told CNN, "Many, many specialists they have studied the qualities of this cannabis and they say it is one of the best in the world,"

"It can provide around $400 million to $800 million of revenue to the country," he adds.

Haidar, who is also a native of the region, argues that there are few alternatives to hashish cultivation in these plains. The plant's profit margins, he says, are extremely high -- at least triple those of potatoes and onions.

For now, law enforcement seems to be turning a blind eye to the cannabis farms. Police crackdowns on the farmers are infrequent, though the specter of arrest still hangs in the air, forcing farmers to stay out of the public eye. The predominant political force in the area, Hezbollah, appears to have a largely hands-off relationship with the farmers, according to experts and residents.

Several hashish farmers are supporters of Hezbollah, says Abu Salim. While the group has refrained from publicly endorsing efforts to legalize hashish, its most prominent political ally, House Speaker Nabih Berri, backed the move last month, becoming the most senior figure to do so.

Hezbollah declined CNN's request for comment on the legalization of cannabis.

The people of the area have too much to gain from decriminalizing hashish cultivation, some say. "Nobody can interfere with this one. Not even Hezbollah can interfere with this one. No way. There would be a revolution against them," says Haidar.

So far, the move has received little opposition, a sign that Lebanon's multifaceted political class is supporting it.

"The McKinsey report came out and all the politicians started to jump on it. I think they used it as an excuse to hide behind," says blogger and long-time cannabis legalization advocate Gino Raidy, referring to the 1,000-page economic report that was given to the Lebanese government last month and included a recommendation to legalize medicinal cannabis.

"They all want it ... but no one wants to outright say it so as not to upset their conservative bases."

But the move may also be happening in tandem with a shift in perception about cannabis use. "Ten years ago, no one would have imagined this. Even a joke about hashish was too much back then," says Raidy.

Advocates invoke a period before the French mandate of Lebanon began in 1923, when hashish was sometimes used as a form of currency. "In my hometown, people used to grow it," says Raidy of his village in northern Lebanon. "But then the apple made more economic sense, so they switched to that."

Meanwhile, as the politicians scrape together a cannabis law, Abu Salim will continue what he's been doing for years: tending the plants, harvesting them when they're ready, and selling them on -- despite the various risks.

"The hashish farmer," he says, "always makes money."

__label__world (CNN) Two gay women have been caned in Malaysia amid a worsening climate for LGBT individuals in the Muslim-majority Southeast Asian nation.

The punishment of the two unnamed women took place Monday morning in Terengganu, a state to the east of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, according to rights campaigner Thilaga Sulathireth. The state is governed by Sharia law.

Each woman was lashed six times after being caught attempting to have sex in a parked car. They were also required to pay a fine of 3,300 ringgit ($800).

Sulathireth, who witnessed the caning along with around 100 other people, told CNN that it was a "public caning to all intents and purposes," and that one of the judges had said it was the first time a punishment of this kind had been open to the public.

Monday's punishment shows the religious right "flexing their muscles and making clear that the laws against LGBT activity will be enforced in their state," said Linda Lakhdhir, a legal adviser in the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. Homosexual sex is illegal throughout Malaysia under colonial era criminal law.

The punishment follows a raid on one of Kuala Lumpur's only gay clubs, which saw around 20 men charged for "illicit behavior," and a brutal attack on a trans woman in a city close to the capital.

"It's very uncomfortable, (people are) feeling very oppressed right now. People are afraid because this is the first time that two women are being caned for sexual acts," said Numan Afifi of LGBT activist group the Pelangi Campaign.

The punishment had not previously been used in the state of Terengganu for female homosexuality.

"We don't know what's going to happen in the future. That's the general feeling," said Numan.

The punishment, while handed down by the Sharia court, has the backing of PAS (The Malaysian Islamic Party, or Parti Islam Se-Malaysia), the dominant party in the state.

Despite several attempts, CNN was unable to contact either the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs or PAS, the political party in power in Terengganu.

Protesters raise placards during a pro-LGBT protest in Shah Alam, near Kuala Lumpur in 2011.

Increasingly threatened

Campaigners said they were concerned about the impact of the punishment on the wider LGBT community. "In the past few years... we had seen an increase in state sponsored anti-LGBT rhetoric," said Thilaga Sulathireh, who works with the LGBT advocacy group Sisters for Justice. "What we're seeing now is not coming out of a vacuum. It's the result of years of anti-LBGT efforts."

In August, the country's Deputy Prime Minister, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail told Malaysian media that members of the LGBT community should not seek to "glamorize" their lifestyle.

"Islam is the official religion (of Malaysia), whereby you have certain practices and it is there in black and white," said Ismail, before conceding that members of the LGBT community "have the right to practice whatever (it is) they do in private."

Activists like Sulathireh point to Ismail's comments as proof of the lack of government protection.

"In this climate there's been an increase sense of fear, people are a bit more careful, one of the things we've heard from the community is increased pressure from their families to be safe. We've been hearing cases of hate crimes and different kinds of aggression. This is part of an ongoing trend," said Sulathireh.

Transgender activists celebrate outside the court of appeals in Putrajaya in 2014, when three Malaysian transgender women on November 7 won their landmark bid to overturn an Islamic anti-cross dressing law.

According to Sulathireh, trans women are among the most vulnerable in the LGBT community. Last year Justice for Sisters conducted a small study, interviewing 30 trans women, in which almost half documented cases of hate crimes.

"Being stared at, looked at, being catcalled. Then you have the physical side where people are attacked," said Sulathireh of the 12 hate crimes in the sample pool.

"These are largely (perpetrated) by young people, non-state actors. Sometimes their motives are clear, (but) in many of these cases that we documented, none of the trans women reported the cases to the authorities," said Sulathireh.

Exercising caution

The election of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in May this year had initially been welcomed by members of the LGBT community, but concern is now growing.

"We are seeing shrinking spaces in the new administration," Sulathireh told CNN by phone. "Just in the past 100 days we've seen different types of restrictions on LGBT people. It's very concerning.

The previous government, led by Najib Razak used the country's colonial era sodomy laws to target political opponents, including current leader of the ruling Pakatan Harapan coalition, Anwar Ibrahim.

Anwar, who was jailed for five years in 2015, walked free after being granted a pardon by the country's king in May this year. He has so far failed to speak out in support of LGBT rights.

Rights groups, including Amnesty have called on Anwar to do more to end discriminatory statements by officials and engage in constructively with LGBT organizations.

"It's a long-term project. Attitudes not going to change overnight. The Malaysian government has said that they want to create an inclusive society for Malaysia, one free of discrimination," said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a researcher at Amnesty International.

"Part of promise of real change includes ensuring human rights are for all people in the country. Changing attitudes takes longer, (and) means ending discriminatory statements by government officials."

The brand-new building, paid for by the European Union, was constructed just three weeks ago. Now, little more than the concrete floor and an outhouse remain.

"It doesn't look nice anymore, it's ugly," the eight-year-old says, devastated at the loss of her classroom at Jub El-Thib, east of Bethlehem.

She and her classmates -- 64 children from the first to the fourth grade -- had only been back in class for three days when Israeli forces arrived to demolish the school, which Israel says was built illegally.

Now they've been left with only a tent to shelter from the searing heat of the August sun -- and no tables to sit and study at.

__label__world (CNN) Survivors of the USS Pueblo are suing North Korea, 50 years after the American spy ship was seized off the Korean Peninsula and its crew held hostage and tortured for 11 months .

More than 100 crew members and relatives have joined a lawsuit, filed in February 2018 in a federal court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , which allows victims to sue state sponsors of terrorism for torture, hostage-taking, personal injury or death.

North Korea will almost certainly not respond to the lawsuit, and plaintiffs are unlikely to be able to recover funds directly from Pyongyang, but if successful they will be eligible for relief from a US government fund set up to support victims of terrorism.

US President Donald Trump named North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism in November , after it was removed from the list in 2008 by President George W Bush, re-opening the window to litigation against Pyongyang under the 1976 Act.

"Our clients are seeking to hold North Korea accountable for the unspeakable acts committed against the crew of the USS Pueblo more than 50 years ago and the impact it has had on them and their families since then," the plaintiffs' lawyers said in a statement.

"Even though they can't get back that nearly entire year of their lives, they hope this case will finally bring closure to that horrible chapter."

Seizure and abuse

The Pueblo was seized by North Korea while it was in international waters off the coast of the Korean Peninsula on January 23, 1968.

After a tense standoff in which they desperately radioed for assistance that never came, the 83 crew members were transported to the North Korean port of Wonsan and later to a detention center near Pyongyang.

There they remained for 11 months as tensions on the peninsula ratcheted up to the extent that US generals drew up a potential nuclear strike plan , eventually opening negotiations with the North Koreans at the so-called Panmunjom "peace village," on the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.

After months of talks, the US agreed to sign a North Korean-drafted apology and the men were released across the DMZ.

Speaking to CNN last month, USS Pueblo crew member Stu Russell described their eventual release as the "greatest day" of his life, but he said many of the others were "completely out of it, almost completely devoid of emotion after suppressing our feelings and thoughts for months."

"We were beaten down so far, and trying to come up," said Russell, who is a party to the lawsuit.

According to the lawsuit, the experience of their captivity -- which included regular beatings and torture, malnourishment and general ill treatment -- left many of the men with "severe and lasting or permanent physical injuries and disfigurement and psychological harm."

It also details the "mental anguish, pain and suffering" caused to the families of the crew, as they waited anxiously for news of their loved ones for 11 months and dealt with the after effects of North Korean abuse.

The 104 plaintiffs in the new case are seeking at least $600 million in damages, or around $5.7 million each. Many of the crew are now advanced in age, and still dealing with health problems as a result of their capture and the resulting medical expenses.

The crew of the USS Pueblo cross the Bridge of No Return between North and South Korea, after their release into US custody on December 23, 1968.

Recovering damages

The new case, "John Doe A-1 et al. v. Democratic People's Republic of Korea," follows a successful lawsuit in 2008 brought by three members of the crew, William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck and Donald Raymond McClarren, and Rose Bucher, wife of the Pueblo's late commander, Lloyd Bucher.

In that case, the court awarded the three surviving crew members $16.75 million each, and Bucher's estate $12.5 million for the abuse suffered during capture and the "physical and mental harm that (they) likely will continue to endure throughout the rest of their lives."

The Pueblo crew are led away after being captured by North Korean forces in international waters on January 23, 1968.

North Korea did not respond to that lawsuit, and while it had been initially hoped the plaintiffs could recover damages from North Korean funds seized or frozen under international sanctions, this proved impossible.

However, last year the four were successful in arguing their eligibility for a relief under a $1.1 billion dollar fund established by the Justice for United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act, which can be awarded to people who have "secured final judgments in a United States district court against a state sponsor of terrorism."

The fund was originally designed to compensate the 53 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days between November 1979 and January 1981. They received $4.4 million each in 2015

According to their lawyers, the four Pueblo plaintiffs were awarded $9 million collectively from the fund in October 2017.
__label__world (CNN) — A woman from Australia has found the world's oldest known message in a bottle nearly 132 years after it was thrown into the sea, experts say.

Tonya Illman discovered the bottle half-buried in the sand on a beach in Western Australia, just north of Wedge Island, 180 kilometers (112 miles) north of the state capital Perth.

The bottle was cast into the ocean in 1886. Seven Network

The message, dated 12 June 1886, was thrown into the Indian Ocean from the German sailing barque Paula, which was en route from Cardiff, Wales, to its destination of Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

The bottle was one of thousands thrown into oceans as part of a 69-year-long German experiment on global currents to find faster shipping routes, the Western Australia Museum said.

Until now, the previous world record for the oldest message in a bottle was 108 years, four months and 18 days from the time it was jettisoned until its discovery, according to the museum.

Experts in Germany and Australia have confirmed the authenticity of the find.

Illman found the bottle near her son's car which had become bogged in the beach's soft sand.

'Lovely old bottle'

"My friend Grace Ricciardo and I were walking across the dunes when I saw something sticking out of the sand so I went to take a closer look," Illman was quoted as saying by the museum.

"It just looked like a lovely old bottle so I picked it up thinking it might look good in my bookcase. My son's girlfriend was the one who discovered the note when she went to tip the sand out.

"The note was damp, rolled tightly and wrapped with string. We took it home and dried it out, and when we opened it we saw it was a printed form, in German, with very faint German handwriting on it."

The Illmans took their find to the museum which established the bottle was a 19th Century Dutch gin bottle, the paper and coloration were consistent with 19th Century paper, and the German barque Paula sailed from Cardiff to Makassar (Indonesia) in 1886.

"Incredibly, an archival search in Germany found Paula's original Meteorological Journal and there was an entry for 12 June 1886 made by the captain, recording a drift bottle having been thrown overboard," said Ross Anderson, the museum's assistant curator Maritime Archeology.

"The date and the coordinates correspond exactly with those on the bottle message," he added.
__label__world But when a diver approaches its underwater home, among the tentacles of a sea anemone on the world's coral reefs, the little orange creature rears up and adopts a fierce protective posture.

"They're quite aggressive fish," says Karen Burke da Silva, a marine biologist at Australia's Flinders University.

"If you come close to a clown fish, it will come out of its anemone and try to bite you...it doesn't make sense."

Despite its territorial nature, the clownfish is one of the most easily recognized coral-reef inhabitants.

The orange-and-white striped species was made famous by the popular 2003 animated film "Finding Nemo." The film told the story of an adult clownfish searching for his son Nemo, after a diver captures him from the wild. But its box office success had some unintended consequences.

Overfishing threat

Da Silva says the movie triggered a surge of demand for pet clownfish.

"The film portrays quite a different message, which is 'don't take Nemo out of the sea.' And yet people responded quite differently," she says.

"The places where they were getting those fish were actually from the wild," she explains, adding that overfishing led to local extinction in some places.

Da Silva is co-founder of an initiative called " Saving Nemo ." It partners with schools to promote clownfish conservation and educate students about marine habitats.

At Belgian Gardens Primary School in the Australian city of Townsville, students volunteer to help breed baby clownfish.

"We breed them so we can give fish that we breed to people who want clownfish. So they don't have to take them out of the wild," explains 11-year old Imogen Everson

She and her classmates clean tanks, cultivate the artemia -- or sea monkeys -- used to feed clownfish, and they monitor the growth of hatchling clownfish.

Pupils at Belgian Gardens Primary School are helping to breed baby clownfish.

In one of the tanks, she identifies a small cluster of what appear to be bubbles that line the inside of a clay pot. They are clownfish eggs.

"The dad, the smaller clownfish, will always check on them ... and gives them oxygen," Everson says.

Ryan Pedley, the principal of the school, says captive-bred clownfish are later traded to pet stores for the aquarium supplies needed to help keep the program going.

"It's another way to immerse our students in reef ecology," Pedley says.

"The kids don't actually have to visit the reef. They can do their part by breeding clownfish in captivity and donate them to the fish shops."

Coral reef die-off

Marine biologists say in recent years, the clownfish has been confronted by a newer, potentially more destructive challenge: climate change.

Rising temperatures around the globe are bleaching and killing the coral reefs and the sea anemones with which clownfish share a symbiotic relationship.

In fact, in 2016 and 2017, successive marine heat waves killed off around half of the coral on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef habitat.

"If the [clownfish] can't find a sea anemone to call home and get protection from, we might see that population die," says Jodie Rummer, a marine biologist at James Cook University.

Rummer's research has concluded that if sea temperatures rise between 1.5 and 3 degrees Celsius, coral reef fish lose between 40 to 70% of their performance -- including swimming, feeding and reproduction.

The scientific consensus concludes global temperatures are roughly 1 degree warmer today than during the pre-industrial era in the late 19th century. Scientific organizations like NASA forecast the planet will continue to warm in coming decades as a result of increasing carbon dioxide emissions.

Rummer argues clownfish and other marine species will likely need more drastic help than school captive breeding programs.

"The way to protect them is a really, really big solution: that's kind of ending our reliance on fossil fuels, which is directly related to the warming of the oceans," she says.
__label__world (CNN) Violent brawls and disruptive behavior on a 10-day Carnival Line cruise in the South Pacific led the ship to dock early so Australian police could remove a large family of 23 people.

Cellphone video from the ship shows passengers on the Carnival Legend tussling with each other and security officers amid shouting and screams from alarmed onlookers.

The video also shows security officers kicking passengers after they were down on the floor.

"We have a zero tolerance approach to excessive behavior that affects other guests," Carnival Cruise Line said in a statement. "In line with this policy, we cooperated fully with local authorities in Australia to remove a large family group who had been involved in disruptive acts aboard Carnival Legend.

"Our security team responded in several instances to extremely unruly behavior by these guests. One particular altercation in the nightclub began when the group physically attacked other guests."

__label__world (CNN) A self-described Russian "seductress" is asking for US help to escape a Thai detention center in exchange for information on alleged links between US President Donald Trump and Russia, according to her Instagram account.

Anastasia Vashukevich, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, says she's being held in Thailand after being arrested on February 26, along with nine other Russians, in the city of Pattaya for running so-called "sex training" sessions. Rybka has said she's from Belarus but entered Thailand on a Russian passport, a Thai immigration official told CNN.

While on the way to prison in Pattaya, Rybka published a video on her Instagram account begging US journalists to help her.

"I'm ready to give you all the missing puzzle pieces, support them with videos and audios, regarding the connections of our respected lawmakers with Trump, Manafort and the rest. I know a lot. I'm waiting for your offers and I'm waiting for you in a Thai prison," she said.

Rybka has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny published an investigation earlier this month on his anti-corruption foundation website into her connections with some of Russia's richest and most powerful men.
